"This article will attempt to analyze the current impact of Artificial Intelligence in Spanish healthcare, as well as the challenges that its application poses both from an ethical and legal point of view. Technological advances, which are already being applied in healthcare, make it necessary to adapt the legal system to the new trends that are emerging in society and force healthcare professionals to review their codes of ethics in the face of new ethical dilemmas, since these codes of ethics do not have clear guidelines for action on AI that raise relevant ethical problems to which no response is being given, except for the code of ethics for medicine, which has recently been included. After a review of the last 5 years of Spanish and European regulations in medicine, it can be concluded that the regulation and legislation of the application of AI is very deficient, both in the EU and in Spain. In order to try to identify different ways of resolving conflicts related to AI in medicine, jurisprudential sentences related to the rights and obligations of health professionals, patients and users have been analyzed and reviewed. Therefore, the paper concludes with the proposal of a series of aspects to be taken into account for the future regulation of the application of AI in medicine. © 2024, The Author(s).",3,10.1057/s41599-023-02565-2,"This article analyzes the impact of AI in Spanish healthcare, focusing on ethical and legal challenges.

"Artificial Intelligence has the potential to improve human decisions in complex environments, but its effectiveness can remain limited if humans hold context-specific private information. Using the empirical example of antibiotic prescribing for urinary tract infections, we show that full automation of prescribing fails to improve on physician decisions. Instead, optimally delegating a share of decisions to physicians, where they possess private diagnostic information, effectively utilizes the complementarity between algorithmic and human decisions. Combining physician and algorithmic decisions can achieve a reduction in inefficient overprescribing of antibiotics by 20.3 percent. © The Author(s) 2024.",3,10.1007/s11129-024-09284-1,"This paper investigates the interaction between AI and human decision-making in the context of antibiotic prescribing.

"Technological innovations at the time of the pandemic and post pandemic is the focus of this paper which examines the relationship between intellectual property (IP), artificial intelligence (AI) and the healthcare sector. Research in this area includes the rapidly growing artificial intelligence industries in the healthcare sector and the impact of intellectual property protection on emerging technologies. Taking an interdisciplinary and diverse perspective, this paper enriches the evolving scope of ethical discourse literature by focusing on intellectual property assets that use AI and regulation that shape the healthcare sector. Considering the gap between law and development theory and practice, this paper bridges academic knowledge in unpacking ethical and governance issues in the intellectual property industry, healthcare law and emerging technologies. Unpacking these issues is important in the law and development context as ethical issues that arise from emerging technologies using AI systems and the responses from policymakers in governing their developments create long-term implications to individuals and populations.

"Adverse selection harms market efficiency and access to essential services, particularly for disadvantaged groups. Risk equalization policies attempt to mitigate this by compensating agents for risk disparities, but often fall short of addressing interactions between risk factors. Using health insurance data from the Netherlands, we present a machine learning approach to capture unanticipated interactions that impact medical expenditure risk. We compare our novel approach to a state-of-the-art statistical model. We find that our approach explains an additional 1.5% of medical expenditure, equivalent to 571 million euros over all individuals in the Dutch market. In particular, this translates into better compensation for low- and high-cost groups that are especially vulnerable to adverse selection. These findings confirm the significance of risk factor interactions in explaining medical expenditure risk, and support the adoption of machine learning alongside statistical models to further mitigate selection incentives in risk equalization policies. © 2023 The Authors",3,10.1016/j.econmod.2023.106564,"This paper employs a machine learning approach to analyze interactions between risk factors affecting medical expenditure in health insurance.

"Objectives: Ataluren and eteplirsen are orphan drugs that delay progression of Duchenne muscular dystrophy in mutation-specific subgroups. They have yet to be approved in Egypt but are expected to reach the market soon. This study describes 2 cost-utility models comparing the drugs with the standard of care. Methods: We used a partition-survival model with 5 states based on the ambulatory status to model a cohort of ambulatory patients at the age of 5 years. Baseline curves were obtained from a published model; then the ambulation loss curve was updated using the Kaplan-Meier curve of the standard of care from a study by McDonald et al. Other curves were updated by calibration to this curve. Costs and utilities were from a local study. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. Prices were estimated based on other orphan drugs’ prices. Results: In the base case, ataluren 1000 mg and eteplirsen 50 mg/mL resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of EGP 51 745 605 and EGP 69 652 533/quality-adjusted life-year, respectively, at their hypothetical prices of EGP 308 600 for ataluren 30-sachet pack and EGP 62 800 for eteplirsen 10 mL vial. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was sensitive to health state utilities but not to state costs. At EGP 911 719/quality-adjusted life-year threshold, the value-based prices were EGP 4680 for ataluren 1000 mg and EGP 733 for eteplirsen 10 mL vial. Conclusions: Based on these models, there is a huge gap between the prices of orphan drugs and their value-based prices, which highlights the need for major policy reforms in the assessment and pricing of orphan drugs. © 2023 International Society for Health Economics and Outcomes Research",3,10.1016/j.vhri.2023.08.004,This study develops cost-utility models to compare the economic impact of two orphan drugs for Duchenne muscular dystrophy against standard care.

"We study the market for AI systems that are used to help to diagnose and treat diseases, reducing the risk of medical error. Based on a two-firm vertical product differentiation model, we examine how, in the event of patient harm, the amount of the compensation payment, and the division of this compensation between physicians and AI system producers affects both price competition between firms, and the accuracy (quality) of AI systems. One producer sells products with the best-available accuracy. The other sells a system with strictly lower accuracy at a lower price. Specifically, we show that both producers enjoy a positive market share, so long as some patients are diagnosed by physicians who do not use an AI system. Any transfer in compensation payment from the physician to the AI producer in the case of a diagnostic error will be passed on in full to the physician via the price of the AI system. The quality of the AI diagnosis system is independent of how any compensation payment to the patient is divided between physicians and producers. However, the magnitude of the compensation payment matters. An increase in compensation increases demand for both AI systems. In addition, the higher the compensation paid to the harmed patient, the higher the quality of the low-quality AI system. As the other firm continues to offer the highest accuracy level, any increase in compensation will decrease vertical differentiation, thereby increasing price competition between firms. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",3,10.1016/j.irle.2023.106153,"This paper analyzes the market dynamics of AI systems in healthcare, focusing on how compensation payments for medical errors influence price competition and the quality of AI systems.

"Artificial intelligence (AI) integration in healthcare has shown tremendous potential, however, it has also raised profound ethical concerns. This study aimed to examine the role of perceived AI usefulness, awareness of AI implications, innovation capabilities and ethical bio education in facilitating responsible AI adoption in healthcare. A questionnaire-based survey was conducted targeting healthcare employees in the USA. The results of PLS-SEM analysis showed that perceived usefulness positively influenced AI adoption and innovation capabilities but had no significant effect on ethical bio education. AI awareness strongly predicted ethical bio education both directly and indirectly via innovation capabilities. Additionally, AI adoption and innovation capabilities positively affected ethical bio education, underscoring their critical role. The findings imply that creating awareness of AI's ethical pitfalls along with advancing innovation capacities can promote ethical AI assimilation in healthcare.

"How should payment systems of means-tested benefits be designed to improve the financial situation of needy recipients most effectively? We study this question in the context of mandatory health insurance in Switzerland, where recipients initially receive either a cash transfer or subsidized insurance premiums (a form of in-kind transfer). A federal reform in 2014 forced cantons (i.e. states) to universally switch to in-kind provision. We exploit this setting based on a difference-in-differences design, analyzing eight years of rich individual-level accounting data and applying a machine learning approach to identify cash recipients prior to the reform. We find that switching from cash to in-kind transfers persistently reduces the likelihood of late premium payments by about 20% and of government debt collection for long-term missed payments by approximately 12%.

"We have investigated methodologies for predicting radiologists' workload in a short time interval by adopting a machine learning technique. Predicting for shorter intervals requires lower execution time combined with higher accuracy. To deal with this issue, an ensemble model is proposed with the fixed-batch-training method. To excel in the execution time, a fixed-batch-training method is used. On the other hand, the ensemble of multiple machine learning algorithms provides higher accuracy. The experimental result shows that this predictive model can produce at least 10% higher accuracy in comparison with the other available widely used short-term time series forecasting models. In the studied medical system, this gain in accuracy for the earlier prediction of workload can reduce the Medicare relative value unit cost by $1.1 million annually, which we have formulated and shown in this paper.

"Research background:Deep and machine learning-based algorithms can assist in COVID-19 image-based medical diagnosis and symptom tracing, optimize intensive care unit admission, and use clinical data to determine patient prioritization and mortality risk, being pivotal in qualitative care provision, reducing medical errors, and increasing patient survival rates, thus diminishing the massive healthcare system burden in relation to severe COVID-19 inpatient stay duration, while increasing operational costs throughout the organizational management of hospitals. Data-driven financial and scenario-based contingency planning, predictive mod-elling tools, and risk pooling mechanisms should be deployed for additional medical equipment and unforeseen healthcare demand expenses. Purpose of the article: We show that deep and machine learning-based and clinical decision making systems can optimize patient survival likelihood and treatment outcomes with regard to susceptible, infected, and recovered individuals, performing accurate analyses by data modeling based on vital and clinical signs, surveillance data, and infection-related biomarkers, and furthering hospital facility optimization in terms of intensive care unit bed allocation. Methods: The review software systems employed for article screening and quality evaluation were: AMSTAR, AXIS, DistillerSR, Eppi-Reviewer, MMAT, PICO Portal, Rayyan, ROBIS, and SRDR. Findings & value added: Deep and machine learning-based clinical decision support tools can forecast COVID-19 spread, confirmed cases, and infection and mortality rates for data-driven appropriate treatment and resource allocations in effective therapeutic and diagnosis protocol development, by determining suitable measures and regulations and by using symptoms and comorbidities, vital signs, clinical and laboratory data and medical records across intensive care units, impacting the healthcare financing infrastructure. As a result of heightened use of personal protective equipment, hospital pharmacy and medication, outpatient treatment, and medical supplies, revenue loss and financial vulnerability occur, also due to expenses related to hiring additional staff and to critical resource expenditures. Hospital costs for COVID-19 medical care, screening, treatment capacity expansion, and personal protective equipment can lead to further financial losses while affecting COVID-19 frontline hospital workers and pa-tients. © Instytut Badań Gospodarczych / Institute of Economic Research (Poland).",3,10.24136/oc.2984,"This paper reviews the application of deep and machine learning algorithms in optimizing COVID-19 diagnosis, treatment outcomes, and resource allocation in healthcare settings.

"Background: The Ambient Intelligent Geriatric Management (AmbIGeM) system combines wearable sensors with artificial intelligence to trigger alerts to hospital staff before a fall. A clinical trial found no effect across a heterogenous population, but reported a reduction in the injurious falls rate in a post hoc analysis of patients on Geriatric Evaluation Management Unit (GEMU) wards. Cost-effectiveness and Value of Information (VoI) analyses of the AmbIGeM system in GEMU wards was undertaken. Methods: An Australian health-care system perspective and 5-year time horizon were used for the cost-effectiveness analysis. Implementation costs, inpatient costs and falls data were collected. Injurious falls were defined as causing bruising, laceration, fracture, loss of consciousness, or if the patient reported persistent pain. To compare costs and outcomes, generalised linear regression models were used to adjust for baseline differences between the intervention and usual care groups. Bootstrapping was used to represent uncertainty. For the VoI analysis, 10,000 different sample sizes with randomly sampled values ranging from 1 to 50,000 were tested to estimate the optimal sample size of a new trial that maximised the Expected Net Benefits of Sampling. Results: An adjusted 0.036 fewer injurious falls (adjusted rate ratio of 0.56) and AUD$4554 lower costs were seen in the intervention group. However, uncertainty that the intervention is cost effective for the prevention of an injurious fall was present at all monetary values of this effectiveness outcome. A new trial with a sample of 4376 patients was estimated to maximise the Expected Net Benefit of Sampling, generating a net benefit of AUD$186,632 at a benefit-to-cost ratio of 1.1. Conclusions: The benefits to cost ratio suggests that a new trial of the AmbIGeM system in GEMU wards may not be high-value compared to other potential trials, and that the system should be implemented. However, a broader analysis of options for preventing falls in GEMU is required to fully inform decision making.

We calibrate our model using real data from the 1970 British Cohort Survey together with the features of the English HE financing system. We allow for individual heterogeneity by considering different family backgrounds and occupations. We find that graduates from poor families, males and graduates working in the private sector are more willing to pay to switch to an ICL. Using the UK Labour Force Survey we evaluate the distributive effects of our model. We compute the repayment burdens and taxpayer subsidies for average, low and high earnings graduates.

"Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in variety of areas has encouraged an extensive global discourse on the underlying ethical principles and values. With the rapid AI development process and its near instant global coverage, the issues of applicable ethical principles and guidelines have become vital. AI promises to deliver a lot of advantages to economic, social and educational fields. Since AI is also increasingly applied in healthcare and medical education areas, ethical application issues are growing ever more important. Ethical and social issues raised by AI in healthcare overlap with those raised by personal data use, function automation, reliance on assistive medical technologies and the so-called ‘telehealth’. Without well-grounded ethical guidelines or even regulatory framework in respect of the AI in healthcare several legal and ethical problems at the implementational level can arise.

"Background: In virologically suppressed patients, switching to darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r) monotherapy maintains HIV RNAsuppression, and could also lower treatment costs. Objective: The purpose of this analysis was to calculate the potential cost savings from the use of DRV/r monotherapy in the UK. Methods: In the MONET trial, 256 patients with HIV RNA <50 copies/mL on current highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for over 24 weeks (non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor [NNRTI] based [43%] or protease inhibitor [PI] based [57%]), switched to DRV/r 800/100 mg once daily, either as monotherapy (n = 127) or with two NRTIs (n = 129). The UK costs per patient with HIV RNA <50 copies/mL at week 48 (responders) were calculated using a switch included analysis to account for additional antiretrovirals taken after initial treatment failure. By this analysis, efficacy was 93.5% versus 95.1% in the DRV/r monotherapy and triple therapy arms, respectively. British National Formulary 2009 values were used. Results: Before the trial, the mean annual cost of antiretrovirals was £6906 for patients receiving NNRTI-based HAART, and £8348 for patients receiving PI-based HAART. During the MONET trial, the mean annual per-patient cost of antiretrovirals was £8642 in the triple therapy arm, of which 55% was from NRTIs and 45% from PIs. The mean per-patient cost in the monotherapy arm was £4126, a saving of 52% versus triple therapy. The mean cost per responder was £9085 in the triple therapy arm versus £4413 in the DRV/r monotherapy arm. Conclusions: Based on the MONET results, the lower cost of DRV/r monotherapy versus triple therapy in the UK would allow more patients to be treated for fixed budgets, while maintaining HIV RNA suppression at <50 copies/mL. If all patients meeting the inclusion criteria of the MONET trial in theUKwere switched to DRV/r monotherapy, there is the potential to save up to £60 million in antiretroviral drug costs from the UK NHS budget. © 2011 Adis Data Information BV.

"AI systems can bring great benefits to our healthcare systems, e.g. by improving patient outcomes. Yet implementing them into clinical practice remains challenging. To bridge the gap between academic research and design implementation, we argue clinicians need transparency about such systems that is meaningful - i.e. contextually appropriate - to them. Towards this, we explore recent HCXAI recommendations for building transparent AI systems for users in a specific domain: gynaecology. By better understanding clinicians' perspectives on meaningful transparency, our aim is to complement and help operationalise such recommendations. We conduct a co-design workshop and interviews with n=15 gynaecologists in the UK and the Netherlands. We show that HCXAI must better account for clinical teams with different types of gynaecologist users, and that the timeliness and relevance of the information provided about the AI-based tool throughout its design lifecycle - in particular before a tool is implemented into clinical practice - is crucial for transparency to become meaningful. Our contributions include: i) testing recommendations from the latest HCXAI literature with a prospective, real-life AI application in a relatively less-studied clinical domain; ii) describing and visualising gynaecologists' understanding of meaningful transparency for clinicians; iii) outlining four design recommendations towards realising meaningful transparency for clinicians and opportunities for research; and iv) expanding HCI and AI research in women's health by directly engaging with gynaecologists as users and co-designers.

"The aim of this paper is to decipher and investigate the relationship between artificial intelligence implementation (AII), healthcare social innovation (HSI) and hospitals’ green image (HGI) in an Egyptian emerging market. An interdisciplinary research with a mixed-methods approach was conducted to add bricks, conceptually and empirically, that fill a literature gap between using this evolving AI-technology and sustaining socially-innovative medical operations and supply-chain management (OSCM) practices in a dynamic green healthcare industry. After scanning the relevant transdisciplinary literature, the authors developed and tested a conceptual model through analysing data collected from 116 quantitative questionnaires answered by healthcare managers/leaders in 46 Egyptian hospitals. After applying structural equation modeling using SmartPLS-v4, the results illustrated that AII has a positive significant impact on HSI, which has a positive significant influence on HGI. Furthermore, AII-HGI relationship can be fully-mediated significantly by HSI, which confirms the significant role of AI-powered technology in reinforcing socially-innovative medical OSCM processes to sustain an environmental-friendly image of Egyptian hospitals. Based on these quantitative findings and qualitative fruitful interviews with healthcare leaders and technology experts, this article used a comprehensive approach to contribute to AI-enhanced healthcare OSCM literature in interdependent ways.

We examine how seemingly compelling claims are tested as AI tools move into real-world settings and discuss how analysts can develop effective understandings in novel and rapidly changing settings. Four case studies highlight the challenges of utilising diagnostic AI tools at differing stages in their innovation journey. Two ‘upstream’ cases seeking to demonstrate the practical applicability of AI and two ‘downstream’ cases focusing on the roll out and scaling of more established applications. We observed an unfolding uncoordinated process of social learning capturing two key moments: i) experiments to create and establish the clinical potential of AI tools; and, ii) attempts to verify their dependability in clinical settings while extending their scale and scope.

"Tools based on machine learning (so-called artificial intelli-gence, AI) are increasingly being developed to diagnose malignant melanoma in dermatology. This contribution discusses (1) three scenarios for the use of AI in different medical settings, (2) shifts in competencies from dermatologists to non-specialists and empowered patients, (3) regulatory frameworks to ensure safety and effectiveness and their consequences for AI tools, and (4) cognitive dissonance and potential delegation of human decision-making to AI. We conclude that AI systems should not replace human medical expertise but play a supporting role. We identify needs for regulation and provide recommendations for action to help all (human) actors navigate safely through the choppy waters of this emerging market. Potential dilemmas arise when AI tools provide diagnoses that conflict with human medical expertise.

"Mobile health information services combine user physiological data and daily exercise information to help users achieve their fitness goals. Such services include Runkeeper, Trainingpeaks, and Strava. These services provide recommendations for short-term physical activity plans for their users, thereby improving their performance in these physical activities and enabling them to live a healthier life. For decades, wearable activity trackers and fitness applications have been widely adopted in these healthcare intervention programs, making it inexpensive and convenient for users to manage their health. Typically, mobile health information services record and visualize exercise activities through wearable trackers on their users and then deliver a set of recommendations for daily exercise through mobile applications. Mobile health information services are often used to support health promotion programs for physical activity and weight management. A growing number of people will likely manage their health using mobile health information services in the coming years in response to increasing health risks caused by the prevalence of obesity and sedentary lifestyle habits. Although mobile health services have excellent potential for their users to promote health and low operational costs based on the use of mobile devices, a significant challenge is to evaluate and optimize the process of health intervention. The reasons for inefficiency in mobile health services may be threefold. First, selecting effective daily exercise plans is difficult based on the heterogeneity of the physical characteristics, activity performance, and fitness demands of users. The most popular mobile health services push nonpersonalized and static activity plans to users. There is increasing evidence that such non-personalized and fixed daily exercise plans may result in unchanged or reduced physical activity. Second, the improvement of health depends on efforts made by the individual to implement daily exercise plans. However, individuals often have self-control problems to the extent that they may fail to complete daily tasks. Third, mobile health interventions have an impact on user physical activity levels in the long term, which are associated with changing preferences. Therefore, wearable devices should be used to monitor and collect structured information regarding user physical activities, which could allow mobile health services to modify user exercise plans appropriately in a dynamic manner. During this interaction process, mobile health services face the crucial question of how to tailor the process to optimize exercise performance in a dynamic and uncertain environment in the long term for different individuals. This study sought an efficient method to solve the problem of optimal goal setting for personalized mobile health information services using data-driven models. In this paper, we propose a real-time interaction model for the personalized goal setting problem considering the dynamic and uncertain behavior of users to maximize their long-term health utilities. Each user′s mobile health practice progress is modeled as a Markov decision process that can dynamically control personalized practice plans involving a sequential progression of decisions. The dependencies among decision policies over time are associated with the changing behavioral preferences of individuals, which can be represented through the interaction traces recorded by mobile devices. This paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning methodology with a hybrid neural network for the personalized mobile health process optimization problem. The proposed method constructs a quantitative model for each user to predict current and future behaviors using historical data. Simultaneously, it utilizes the constructed model to generate actionable plans to maximize the individual′s total utility in the long term. A reinforcement learning method is applied based on the prioritized replay deep Q network algorithm to determine the optimal policy through exploration and exploitation. We present experiments demonstrating how our policy can be implemented in real life using published data and our deep reinforcement learning methodology successfully generates individual-specific services based on deep reinforcement learning methodology can adapt to changes in user behavior, boost user exercise performance, and promote a healthy lifestyle. Although adopting an artificial intelligence system for mobile health information services requires an initial investment, these investments will pay off in the form of higher user satisfaction during long-term service. The more satisfied the users, the higher the service repurchase rate. Additionally, increasing the goodwill of mobile health information services will increase their appeal to new customers. © (2023), (Zhejiang University).

"This paper aims to optimise healthcare resource pre-positioning, patient scheduling, and patient transferring under uncertain demands and stochastic resource consumption. We propose a two-stage stochastic programming model that formulates the patient scheduling problem as a Markov decision process. To address complexities and uncertainties, we use Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to improve both model formulation and algorithmic performance. To tackle the limited data challenge, we introduce a Wasserstein distance-based ambiguity set and propose a two-stage distributionally robust optimisation (DRO) model, which derives a deterministic equivalent using the Lagrangian dual of non-anticipativity constraints. The solution process is accelerated with a scenario decomposition approach and the K-means clustering method. Both theoretical and numerical results demonstrate the consistency of the two-stage DRO model with the sample average approximation (SAA) method. The potential of AI to improve the model's performance is evident through the significant reduction in computation time achieved with the K-means clustering approach without compromising solution quality. Compared to the SAA method, the DRO model exhibits a considerable reduction in the waiting penalty cost for out-of-sample cases, ranging from (Formula presented.) to (Formula presented.). Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms SAA methods and several benchmark policies in terms of computational efficiency and solutions. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",3,10.1080/00207543.2024.2309312,"This paper focuses on optimizing healthcare resource management through a two-stage stochastic programming model, utilizing AI techniques to enhance model formulation and performance.

"The application of natural language processing and machine learning (ML) in electronic health records (EHRs) may help reduce dementia underdiagnosis, but models that are not designed to reflect minority populations may instead perpetuate underdiagnosis. To improve the identification of undiagnosed dementia, particularly in Black Americans (BAs), we developed support vector machine (SVM) ML models to assign dementia risk scores based on features identified in unstructured EHR data (via latent Dirichlet allocation and stable topic extraction in n = 1 M notes) and structured EHR data. We hypothesized that separate models would show differentiation between racial groups, so the models were fit separately for BAs (n = 5 K with dementia ICD codes, n = 5 K without) and White Americans (WAs; n = 5 K with codes, n = 5 K without). To validate our method, scores were generated for separate samples of BAs (n = 10 K) and WAs (n = 10 K) without dementia codes, and the EHRs of 1.2 K of these patients were reviewed by dementia experts. All subjects were age 65+ and drawn from the VA, which meant that the samples were disproportionately male. A strong positive relationship was observed between SVM-generated risk scores and undiagnosed dementia. BAs were more likely than WAs to have undiagnosed dementia per chart review, both overall (15.3% vs. 9.5%) and among Veterans with >90th percentile cutoff scores (25.6% vs. 15.3%). With chart reviews as the reference standard and varied cutoff scores, the BA model performed slightly better than the WA model (AUC = 0.86 with negative predictive value [NPV] = 0.98, positive predictive value [PPV] = 0.26, sensitivity = 0.61, specificity = 0.92 and accuracy = 0.91 at >90th percentile cutoff vs. AUC = 0.77 with NPV = 0.98, PPV = 0.15, sensitivity = 0.43, specificity = 0.91 and accuracy = 0.89 at >90th).

"Predictive analytics and AI being investigated to see whether they may aid in the early diagnosis of autism spectrum diseases. The suggested method, entitled 'Behavioral Biomarker Identification (BBI),' makes use of machine learning algorithms to spot patterns of behavior that may be suggestive of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Some popular examples of such algorithms are random forests, logistic regression, and deep neural networks (DNNs). Six other common techniques are compared to BBI to see if it is more effective. Research has shown that BBI is more effective, sensitive, and specific than competing methods. Those with autism spectrum condition can now be diagnosed with more certainty and accuracy thanks to this approach. The BBI's potential as a tool for early identification of autism spectrum disorders is supported by its improved accuracy compared to conventional approaches. The high sensitivity of the BBI (88%), which assures a limited level of false negatives, is essential for effectively detecting instances of ASD. Its specificity of 94% is great for eliminating false positives by excluding situations that have nothing to do with ASD. Data privacy and ethical considerations are prioritized in the proposed approach, which addresses them with openness and strict security measures. This ensures that all patient data is handled in a lawful and transparent way. The BBI approach represents a giant leap forward in the quest to diagnose autistic diseases.

"The COVID 19 pandemic has caused an unprecedented health and economic crisis which was characterized by a rapid shortage of Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs). Over the last few decades, academics and practitioners have argued that ‘public health’ should be considered as a Global Public Good (GPG), with a particular emphasis on the control of infectious diseases. The provision of GPGs today—nationally and internationally—involves multiple authorities and actors of varying power at different jurisdictional levels. Strategic behavior and noncooperative and cooperative game theory plays a major role in the success or failure of GPG provision. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the PPEs shortage was alleviated by the involvement of the 3D Printing community which implemented several initiatives. Indeed, health care providers, 3D printing organisations, designers and engineers cooperated to supply PPEs. Software designers released their PPEs digital files, and by choosing freeware, they contributed to the production of the GPG. In this paper, we argue that the success of the 3D printing community in establishing a culture of shared knowledge and data to increase the supply of medical PPEs was made possible thanks to the availability of technology (including 3D Printing and scanning, Artificial Intelligence, and nanomedicine). A game theory model will be used to illustrate the cooperative strategic behaviour of various players involved in this process, and the lessons learned are instrumental for public health policies as well as for intellectual property laws. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",3,10.1007/978-3-031-17037-9_3,"This paper explores the role of the 3D printing community in addressing PPE shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic, emphasizing cooperative behavior among various stakeholders.

"The outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has fundamentally changed the natural course of activity of all economic sectors worldwide, as well as the healthcare sector which was deeply influenced. This paper analyzes the relationship between the increased demand for health services during the pandemic and the limited supply of healthcare using the transversal method for some European Union (EU) states. The demand for health services is quantified by the main health indicators during the pandemic compared to the period before the pandemic. Healthcare is analyzed from the perspective of material as well as human resources. The findings indicate that, in most EU countries, there is a gap between the limited supply of healthcare and the magnitude of the demand for health services due to the SARSCov-2 infection. The results also suggest that in some countries, the gap is more significant than in others due to the measures addressed by the competent authorities, cultural differences and education of the population.

"Problem definition: Uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) are transforming emergency service logistics applications across sectors, offering easy deployment and rapid response. In the context of emergency medical services (EMS), UAVs have the potential to augment ambulances by leveraging bystander assistance, thereby reducing response times for delivering urgent medical interventions and improving EMS outcomes. Notably, the use of UAVs for opioid overdose cases is particularly promising as it addresses the challenges faced by ambulances in delivering timely medication. This study aims to optimize the integration of UAVs and bystanders into EMS in order to minimize average response times for overdose interventions. Methodology/results: We formulate the joint operation of UAVs with ambulances through a Markov decision process that captures random emergency vehicle travel times and bystander availability. We apply an approximate dynamic programming approach to mitigate the solution challenges from high-dimensional state variables and complex decisions through a neural network-based approximation of the value functions (NN-API). To design the approximation, we construct a set of basis functions based on queueing and geographic properties of the UAV-augmented EMS system. Managerial implications: The simulation results suggest that our NN-API policy tends to outperform several noteworthy rule- and optimization-based benchmark policies in terms of accumulated rewards, particularly for situations that are primarily characterized by high request arrival rates and a limited number of available ambulances and UAVs. The results also demonstrate the benefits of incorporating UAVs into the EMS system and the effectiveness of an intelligent real-time operations strategy in addressing capacity shortages, which are often a problem in rural areas of the United States.

"Artificial Intelligence (AI) adoption is transforming many industries, but its impact on the healthcare sector is life-changing. Recent studies and tests show that AI can deliver identical or better prognoses, diagnoses, and surgical outcomes than medical professionals. Healthcare sectors are adopting AI, and its applications are reforming it by reducing expenditure and exceeding patient satisfaction. The dearth of AI advocacy and adoption has forfeited large annual opportunity costs for the health industry and artificial intelligence engineers (AIE). There is a shortage of studies using quantitative models to test the barrier interrelationship and its effect on AI adoption, especially from the perspective of a developing country like India. Therefore, this study explores the barriers to adopting AI in healthcare in India. A total of 250 barriers related to technology adoption are determined after thoroughly analyzing previous studies and several focus group discussions (FGDs). Barriers are reduced to 16 most relevant barriers through multiple Healthcare expert FGDs and the DELPHI method. Interpretive structural modelling (ISM) and crossimpact matrix multiplication applied to classification (MICMAC) are the analytical techniques used to classify the barriers into different impact levels and importance. The derived outcomes from the ISM and MICMAC methods illustrate that the unavailability of infrastructure and policy support and AI's potential cybersecurity vulnerabilities are the predominant problems for AI adoption in healthcare. The outcome is proposed to add to the theory of technology adoption, which facilitates the organizations in selecting the technology and opening the path for its spread and use by healthcare stakeholders.  © 1988-2012 IEEE.",3,10.1109/TEM.2024.3386580,"This study investigates barriers to AI adoption in healthcare in India, utilizing qualitative and quantitative methods, including focus groups and analytical techniques like ISM and MICMAC.

"Radiological imaging is an essential component of a swallowing assessment. Artificial intelligence (AI), especially deep learning (DL) models, has enhanced the efficiency and efficacy through which imaging is interpreted, and subsequently, it has important implications for swallow diagnostics and intervention planning. However, the application of AI for the interpretation of videofluoroscopic swallow studies (VFSS) is still emerging. This review showcases the recent literature on the use of AI to interpret VFSS and highlights clinical implications for speech–language pathologists (SLPs). With a surge in AI research, there have been advances in dysphagia assessments. Several studies have demonstrated the successful implementation of DL algorithms to analyze VFSS. Notably, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which involve training a multi-layered model to recognize specific image or video components, have been used to detect pertinent aspects of the swallowing process with high levels of precision. DL algorithms have the potential to streamline VFSS interpretation, improve efficiency and accuracy, and enable the precise interpretation of an instrumental dysphagia evaluation, which is especially advantageous when access to skilled clinicians is not ubiquitous. By enhancing the precision, speed, and depth of VFSS interpretation, SLPs can obtain a more comprehensive understanding of swallow physiology and deliver a targeted and timely intervention that is tailored towards the individual. This has practical applications for both clinical practice and dysphagia research. As this research area grows and AI technologies progress, the application of DL in the field of VFSS interpretation is clinically beneficial and has the potential to transform dysphagia assessment and management. With broader validation and inter-disciplinary collaborations, AI-augmented VFSS interpretation will likely transform swallow evaluations and ultimately improve outcomes for individuals with dysphagia.

"For the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, it is particularly important to map the course of infection, in terms of patients who have currently tested SARS-CoV-2 positive, as accurately as possible. In hospitals, this is even more important because resources have become scarce. Although polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and point of care (POC) antigen testing capacities have been massively expanded, they are often very time-consuming and cost-intensive and, in some cases, lack appropriate performance. To meet these challenges, we propose the COVIDAL classifier for AI-based diagnosis of symptomatic COVID-19 subjects in hospitals based on laboratory parameters. We evaluate the algorithm's performance by unique multicenter data with approximately 4,000 patients and an extraordinary high ratio of SARS-CoV-2-positive patients. We analyze the influence of data preparation, flexibility in optimization targets, as well as the selection of the test set on the COVIDAL outcome. The algorithm is compared with standard AI, PCR, POC antigen testing and manual classifications of seven physicians by a decision theoretic scoring model including performance metrics, turnaround times and cost. Thereby, we define health care settings in which a certain classifier for COVID-19 diagnosis is to be applied. We find sensitivities, specificities, and accuracies of the COVIDAL algorithm of up to 90 percent. Our scoring model suggests using PCR testing for a focus on performance metrics. For turnaround times, POC antigen testing should be used. If balancing performance, turnaround times, and cost is of interest, as, for example, in the emergency department, COVIDAL is superior based on the scoring model.  © 2023 Association for Computing Machinery.",3,10.1145/3567431,"This paper presents the COVIDAL classifier, an AI-based diagnostic tool for COVID-19, evaluating its performance against traditional testing methods.

"Artificial intelligence has pervaded clinical decision support systems driven by algorithms. In healthcare, algorithmic decision-making is said to outperform clinicians in their treatment choices and recommendations. Yet, relying on an algorithm outcome for clinical decisions comes with uncertainties resulting from the opacity, inconsistency and inaccuracy usurping the epistemic authority of clinicians and ultimately creating aversion. This study explores latent factors that constitute aversion to using algorithm-augmented mobile clinical decision support (mCDS) applications (apps) by clinicians at the point of care. Given that aversion encompasses a tendency to avoid potential risks, we modelled clinicians’ preferences using choice-based conjoint analysis with Hierarchical Bayes (HB) estimation methods to examine 362 clinicians’ aversion algorithm-augmented mCDS apps. In order of magnitude, the findings indicate that clinicians using mCDS apps are averse to algorithms undermining their epistemic authority with persistently inconsistent results at the point of care. In essence, clinicians will at the point-of-care resist algorithms that restrict them from modifying the result in line with their professional responsibilities.

"In the United States, even though national guidelines for allocating scarce healthcare resources are lacking, 26 states have specific ventilator allocation guidelines to be invoked in case of a shortage. While several states developed their guidelines in response to the recent COVID-19 pandemic, New York State developed these guidelines in 2015 as “pandemic influenza is a foreseeable threat, one that we cannot ignore.” The primary objective of this study is to assess the existing procedures and priority rules in place for allocating/rationing scarce ventilator capacity and propose alternative (and improved) priority schemes. We first build machine learning models using inpatient records of COVID-19 patients admitted to New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center and an affiliated community health center to predict survival probabilities as well as ventilator length-of-use. Then, we use the resulting point estimators and their uncertainties as inputs for a multiclass priority queueing model with abandonments to assess three priority schemes: (i) SOFA-P (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment based prioritization), which most closely mimics the existing practice by prioritizing patients with sufficiently low SOFA scores; (ii) ISP (incremental survival probability), which assigns priority based on patient-level survival predictions; and (iii) ISP-LU (incremental survival probability per length-of-use), which takes into account survival predictions and resource use duration. Our findings highlight that our proposed priority scheme, ISP-LU, achieves a demonstrable improvement over the other two alternatives. Specifically, the expected number of survivals increases and death risk while waiting for ventilator use decreases. We also show that ISP-LU is a robust priority scheme whose implementation yields a Pareto-improvement over both SOFA-P and ISP in terms of maximizing saved lives after mechanical ventilation while limiting racial disparity in access to the priority queue. © 2022 Production and Operations Management Society.",3,10.1111/poms.13934,"This study focuses on improving ventilator allocation during shortages by developing machine learning models to predict patient survival and ventilator usage.

"Medical decision making increasingly relies on machine learning algorithms to analyze complex patient data and provide recommendations. However, the lack of interpretability in “black box” models has limited their adoption in clinical practice, which demands transparency and justification. Echo State Networks (ESNs), a recurrent neural network architecture, have shown promise for medical Decision Support Systems (DSS) applications due to their accuracy in modeling time series data, such as physiological signals. However, conventional ESNs suffer from a lack of interpretability, which limits their usefulness for clinical decisions. This study proposes a multi-level framework to optimize both accuracy and interpretability for improved medical decision support. The framework is specifically designed for EEG data, which represents a non-invasive and continuous recording of brain activity. EEG data is ideal for recording information about the internal state of the brain, which is not always translated by perceptible external manifestations. The framework consists of four components: (1) data preprocessing and optimized feature selection utilizing a filter-based feature importance algorithm, (2) ensemble learning via Ensemble ESNs (E-ESNs) that combines the predictions of multiple ESNs to reduce variance and improve accuracy, (3) Global and Local model explanation techniques to allow users to understand the decision-making process and identify the most influential features for each prediction, and (4) decision-making for presenting diagnoses and recommendations. The framework was evaluated on an EEG dataset for stroke prediction, a valuable use case for informed clinical decisions and resource allocation. The results showed that the framework significantly outperformed baseline related works with an accuracy of 96.5% and provides insights into the E-ESN model's predictions. This transparency enhances trust and comprehension among healthcare practitioners.

"Problem definition: We study the estimation of the probability distribution of individual patient waiting times in an emergency department (ED). Whereas it is known that waiting-time estimates can help improve patients’ overall satisfaction and prevent abandonment, existing methods focus on point forecasts, thereby completely ignoring the underlying uncertainty. Communicating only a point forecast to patients can be uninformative and potentially misleading. Methodology/results: We use the machine learning approach of quantile regression forest to produce probabilistic forecasts. Using a large patient-level data set, we extract the following categories of predictor variables: (1) calendar effects, (2) demographics, (3) staff count, (4) ED workload resulting from patient volumes, and (5) the severity of the patient condition. Our feature-rich modeling allows for dynamic updating and refinement of waiting-time estimates as patient- and ED-specific information (e.g., patient condition, ED congestion levels) is revealed during the waiting process. The proposed approach generates more accurate probabilistic and point forecasts when compared with methods proposed in the literature for modeling waiting times and rolling average benchmarks typically used in practice. Managerial implications: By providing personalized probabilistic forecasts, our approach gives low-acuity patients and first responders a more comprehensive picture of the possible waiting trajectory and provides more reliable inputs to inform prescriptive modeling of ED operations. We demonstrate that publishing probabilistic waiting-time estimates can inform patients and ambulance staff in selecting an ED from a network of EDs, which can lead to a more uniform spread of patient load across the network. Aspects relating to communicating forecast uncertainty to patients and implementing this methodology in practice are also discussed. For emergency healthcare service providers, probabilistic waiting-time estimates could assist in ambulance routing, staff allocation, and managing patient flow, which could facilitate efficient operations and cost savings and aid in better patient care and outcomes.

Although there has been significant development of vaccines, it is seen that the mutation of the COVID-19 has made it tough to control with the medication available. Due to an uncountable number of Coronavirus strains, many countries are now facing several waves of the pandemic. Assisted living technologies are evolving with time to give people a better life. This technology can be used for older people in Coronavirus pandemic situations as most of the older people have physical and cognitive impairments. In this paper, we have proposed an Internet of Things(loT)-architectured system incorporated with Artificial intelligence and deep learning that can help diagnose COVID-19 in older people. The proposed architecture will collect all the data from different medical loT sensors and relay them to the cloud, where the system will process and help us monitor the health of older people. This information could be seen from a dedicated dashboard where the user would be able to get diagnosis status of COVID-19 by our system. In order to be prepared for any future pandemic, this type of system will be beneficial. © 2021 IEEE",3,10.1109/ICOIACT53268.2021.9564005,"This paper proposes an IoT-based system that integrates AI and deep learning to diagnose COVID-19 in older adults.

"Most outpatient clinics apply deterministic block scheduling policies to patient visits even though patients utilize varying amounts of time, leaving patients, operations managers, and clinicians frustrated because patients and physicians are kept waiting. This paper offers a decision-making model for schedulers so that the service time needed for a specific patient can be predicted to allow outpatient clinics to schedule more effectively. We employed an analytical approach, with a data driven methodology consisting of two phases. In phase one, machine learning algorithms are used to predict service time for outpatient clinics servicing patients with various characteristics. This study supports the understanding of factors that impact service time. A large dataset from an outpatient clinic is obtained and used in the analyses. Four dominant data mining models are developed to predict service time, and their performances are compared: neural networks (NNs), generalized linear model (GLM), linear regression (LR), and support vector regression (SVM). The NN models performed the best. The reason for visiting the doctor and patient type are identified as the primary characteristics to aid in predicting patient service time. We compare the proposed NN models with commonly used scheduling policies in practice in the second phase via simulation modeling and analysis. This paper contributes to the literature in four ways. First, we obtained a large dataset and extracted quality data to test the prediction accuracy of multiple models to determine which one improves scheduling the best. Second, patient characteristics are identified through machine learning modeling and sensitivity analysis to understand which ones are most important for service time prediction accuracy. Third, we analyzed the performance of standard scheduling policies used in clinics. Lastly, we provide clinical policy implications and recommendations that will provide insights and support appointment scheduling decisions. © 2023",3,10.1016/j.omega.2023.102907,This paper develops a decision-making model to improve outpatient clinic scheduling by predicting service times using machine learning algorithms.

"Understanding a patient's current status, anticipated clinical course, and likely outcomes can be critical to the practice of medicine. Among patients who are comatose after resuscitation from cardiac arrest, identifying those with potential for awakening and favorable recovery is challenging. Currently, this task is accomplished through the acquisition of one or more diagnostic modalities that aim to assess brain function, with expert interpretation of the test results. This approach is subjective, imprecise, and not scalable. We propose an automatic ensemble classification framework, named SmartPrognosis, to identify comatose post-arrest patients with no recovery potential. SmartPrognosis automatically generates and assembles candidate machine learning pipelines with high sensitivity predicting poor outcomes at a fixed near-zero error rate of misclassifying patients with good outcomes.

"Systems based on artificial intelligence (AI) increasingly support physicians in diagnostic decisions. Compared with rule-based systems, however, these systems are less transparent and their errors less predictable. Much research currently aims to improve AI technologies and debates their societal implications. Surprisingly little effort is spent on understanding the cognitive challenges of decision augmentation with AI-based systems although these systems make it more difficult for decision makers to evaluate the correctness of system advice and to decide whether to reject or accept it. As little is known about the cognitive mechanisms that underlie such evaluations, we take an inductive approach to understand how AI advice influences physicians' decision-making process. We conducted experiments with a total of 68 novice and 12 experienced physicians who diagnosed patient cases with an AI-based system that provided both correct and incorrect advice. Based on qualitative data from think-aloud protocols, interviews, and questionnaires, we elicit five decision-making patterns and develop a process model of medical diagnosis decision augmentation with AI advice. We show that physicians use second-order cognitive processes, namely metacognitions, to monitor and control their reasoning while assessing AI advice. These metacognitions determine whether physicians are able to reap the full benefits of AI or not. Specifically, wrong diagnostic decisions often result from shortcomings in utilizing metacognitions related to decision makers' own reasoning (self-monitoring) and metacognitions related to the AI-based system (system monitoring). As a result, physicians fall for decisions based on beliefs rather than actual data or engage in unsuitably superficial information search. Our findings provide a first perspective on the metacognitive mechanisms that decision makers use to evaluate system advice. Overall, our study sheds light on an overlooked facet of decision augmentation with AI, namely, the crucial role of human actors in compensating for technological errors.

"Cancer and other chronic diseases have constituted (and will do so at an increasing pace) a significant portion of healthcare costs in the United States in recent years. Although prior research has shown that diagnostic and treatment recommendations might be altered based on the severity of comorbidities, chronic diseases are still being investigated in isolation from one another in most cases. To illustrate the significance of concurrent chronic diseases in the course of treatment, this study uses SEER's cancer data to create two comorbid data sets: one for breast and female genital cancers and another for prostate and urinal cancers. Several popular machine learning techniques are then applied to the resultant data sets to build predictive models. Comparison of the results shows that having more information about comorbid conditions of patients can improve models' predictive power, which in turn, can help practitioners make better diagnostic and treatment decisions. Therefore, proper identification, recording, and use of patients' comorbidity status can potentially lower treatment costs and ease the healthcare related economic challenges. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

"Machine learning technologies are increasingly developed for use in healthcare. While research communities have focused on creating state-of-the-art models, there has been less focus on real world implementation and the associated challenges to fairness, transparency, and accountability that come from actual, situated use. Serious questions remain underexamined regarding how to ethically build models, interpret and explain model output, recognize and account for biases, and minimize disruptions to professional expertise and work cultures.

Sepsis is a severe infection that can lead to organ failure or death if not treated in time and is the leading cause of inpatient deaths in US hospitals. We, the team that developed and evaluated the tool, discuss our conceptualization of the tool not as a model deployed in the world but instead as a socio-technical system requiring integration into existing social and professional contexts. Rather than focusing solely on model interpretability to ensure fair and accountable machine learning, we point toward four key values and practices that should be considered when developing machine learning to support clinical decision-making: rigorously define the problem in context, build relationships with stakeholders, respect professional discretion, and create ongoing feedback loops with stakeholders. Our work has significant implications for future research regarding mechanisms of institutional accountability and considerations for responsibly designing machine learning systems.

"When we encounter an unexpected critical health problem, a hospital's emergency department (ED) becomes our vital medical resource. Improving an ED's timeliness of care, quality of care, and operational efficiency while reducing avoidable readmissions, is fraught with difficulties, which arise from complexity and uncertainty. In this paper, we describe an ED decision support system that couples machine learning, simulation, and optimization to address these improvement goals. The system allows healthcare administrators to globally optimize workflow, taking into account the uncertainties of incoming patient injuries and diseases and their associated care, thereby significantly reducing patient length of stay. This is achieved without changing physical layout, focusing instead on process consolidation, operations tracking, and staffing. First implemented at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia, the system helped reduce length of stay at Grady by roughly 33 percent. By repurposing existing resources, the hospital established a clinical decision unit that resulted in a 28 percent reduction in ED readmissions. Insights gained from the implementation also led to an investment in a walkin center that eliminated more than 32 percent of the nonurgent-care cases from the ED. As a result of these improvements, the hospital enhanced its financial standing and achieved its target goal of an average ED length of stay of close to seven hours. ED and trauma efficiencies improved throughput by over 16 percent and reduced the number of patients who left without being seen by more than 30 percent. The annual revenue realized plus savings generated are approximately $190 million, a large amount relative to the hospital's $1.5 billion annual economic impact. The underlying model, which we generalized, has been tested and implemented successfully at 10 other EDs and in other hospital units. The system offers significant advantages in that it permits a comprehensive analysis of the entire patient flow from registration to discharge, enables a decision maker to understand the complexities and interdependencies of individual steps in the process sequence, and ultimately allows the users to perform system optimization. © 2015 INFORMS 59.",3,10.1287/inte.2014.0788,"This paper presents a decision support system that integrates machine learning, simulation, and optimization to enhance emergency department (ED) operations.

"Artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare is becoming increasingly important, given its potential to generate and analyse healthcare data to improve patient care and reduce costs and clinical risk while enhancing administrative processes within organisations. AI can introduce new sources of growth, change how people work and improve the effectiveness of their work. Consequently, implementing AI systems in healthcare can enable the optimisation of healthcare resources, facilitate a better patient experience, improve population health, reduce per capita costs, and improve the satisfaction of health professionals. Nowadays, most studies have focused on the potential benefits and barriers to implementing AI in healthcare, while only a few have explained the rational decision-making process for deploying new technologies in the healthcare system. In this study, we aim to fill this gap by investigating how AI supports the effective and efficient management of the healthcare system by examining the Humber River Hospital in Toronto using the case study methodology. To achieve the desired benefits from the process of implementing technology in healthcare, our key findings show that hospitals need to undergo a business transformation that exploits technology.

"Hospital readmissions present an increasingly important challenge for health-care organizations. Readmissions are expensive and often unnecessary, putting patients at risk and costing $15 billion annually in the United States alone. Currently, 17% of Medicare patients are readmitted to a hospital within 30 days of initial discharge with readmissions typically being more expensive than the original visit to the hospital. Recent legislation penalizes organizations with a high readmission rate. The medical literature conjectures that many readmissions can be avoided or mitigated by post-discharge monitoring. To develop a good monitoring plan it is critical to anticipate the timing of a potential readmission and to effectively monitor the patient for readmission causing conditions based on that knowledge. This research develops new methods to empirically generate an individualized estimate of the time to readmission density function and then uses this density to optimize a post-discharge monitoring schedule and staffing plan to support monitoring needs. Our approach integrates classical prediction models with machine learning and transfer learning to develop an empirical density that is personalized to each patient. We then transform an intractable monitoring plan optimization with stochastic discharges and health state evolution based on delay-time models into a weakly coupled network flow model with tractable subproblems after applying a new pruning method that leverages the problem structure. Using this multi-methodologic approach on two large inpatient datasets, we show that optimal readmission prediction and monitoring plans can identify and mitigate 40-70% of readmissions before they generate an emergency readmission. © 2015 Production and Operations Management Society.",3,10.1111/poms.12377,This research focuses on predicting hospital readmissions and optimizing post-discharge monitoring plans using a combination of classical prediction models and machine learning.

"With the rise of artificial intelligence, case-based health knowledge management systems (CBHKS) have been widely adopted in hospitals. CBHKS are data-driven intelligent platforms that integrate latest technologies, such as artificial intelligence and cloud computing. As an integral part of smart hospitals, CBHKS can support decision processes at different levels in hospitals. However, researchers have not yet clearly addressed how CBHBKS improves hospital management outcomes. Based on group effectiveness and leadership performance-maintenance theories, we develop a conceptual model to explain the role of CBHKS in hospital management. To test the research hypotheses in the conceptual model, we collected survey data from 214 doctors, and performed data analysis using partial least squares (PLS)-based structural equation modeling.

"Low attendance levels in medical appointments have been associated with poor health outcomes and efficiency problems for service providers. To address this problem, healthcare managers could aim at improving attendance levels or minimizing the operational impact of no-shows by adapting resource allocation policies. However, given the uncertainty of patient behaviour, generating relevant information regarding no-show probabilities could support the decision-making process for both approaches. In this context many researchers have used multiple regression models to identify patient and appointment characteristics than can be used as good predictors for no-show probabilities. This work develops a Decision Support System (DSS) to support the implementation of strategies to encourage attendance, for a preventive care program targeted at underserved communities in Bogotá, Colombia. Our contribution to literature is threefold. Firstly, we assess the effectiveness of different machine learning approaches to improve the accuracy of regression models. In particular, Random Forest and Neural Networks are used to model the problem accounting for non-linearity and variable interactions. Secondly, we propose a novel use of Layer-wise Relevance Propagation in order to improve the explainability of neural network predictions and obtain insights from the modelling step. Thirdly, we identify variables explaining no-show probabilities in a developing context and study its policy implications and potential for improving healthcare access.

"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is arguably the most exciting robotics industry and it is recently emerging in healthcare. Most of the researches have been focusing on prediction algorithms of patients' diseases such as cancer, cardiology, breast pathology, etc. Some findings increased computer intelligence as the main application of AI which called deep or non-deep machine learning. The gap from previous models is using one function or one type of AI to analyze, forecast diseases rather than helping patients and doctors in surgery. There are rarely white papers using AI for patients approach to training them to know more about their diseases or surgery.

"Various factors are behind the forces that drive hospitals toward more sustainable operations. Hospitals contracting with Medicare, for instance, are reimbursed for the procedures performed, regardless of the number of days that patients stay in the hospital. This reimbursement structure has incentivized hospitals to use their resources (such as their beds) more efficiently to maximize revenues. One way hospitals can improve bed utilization is by predicting patients’ length of stay (LOS) at the time of admission, the benefits of which extend to employees, communities, and the patients themselves. In this paper, we employ a data analytics approach to develop and test a deep learning neural network to predict LOS for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and pneumonia. The theoretical contribution of our effort is that it identifies variables related to patients’ prior admissions as important factors in the prediction of LOS in hospitals, thereby revising the current paradigm in which patients’ medical histories are rarely considered for the prediction of LOS. The methodological contributions of our work include the development of a data engineering methodology to augment the data sets, prediction of LOS as a numerical (rather than a binary) variable, temporal evaluation of the training and validation data sets, and a significant improvement in the accuracy of predicting LOS for COPD and pneumonia inpatients. Our evaluations show that variables related to patients’ previous admissions are the main driver of the deep network's superior performance in predicting the LOS as a numerical variable. Using the assessment criteria introduced in prior studies (i.e., ±2 days and ±3 days tolerance), our models are able to predict the length of hospital stay with 86 % and 91 % accuracy for the COPD data set, and with 74 % and 85 % accuracy for the pneumonia data set.

"Recent advances in remote patient monitoring (RPM) systems can recognize various human activities to measure vital signs, including subtle motions from superficial vessels. There is a growing interest in applying artificial intelligence (AI) to this area of healthcare by addressing known limitations and challenges such as predicting and classifying vital signs and physical movements, which are considered crucial tasks. Federated learning is a relatively new AI technique designed to enhance data privacy by decentralizing traditional machine learning modeling. However, traditional federated learning requires identical architectural models to be trained across the local clients and global servers. This limits global model architecture due to the lack of local models’ heterogeneity. To overcome this, a novel federated learning architecture, FedStack, which supports ensembling heterogeneous architectural client models was proposed in this study. This work offers a protected privacy system for hospitalized in-patients in a decentralized approach and identifies optimum sensor placement. The proposed architecture was applied to a mobile health sensor benchmark dataset from 10 different subjects to classify 12 routine activities. Three AI models, artificial neural network (ANN), convolutional neural network (CNN), and bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) were trained on individual subject data. The federated learning architecture was applied to these models to build local and global models capable of state-of-the-art performances. The local CNN model outperformed ANN and Bi-LSTM models on each subject data. Our proposed work has demonstrated better performance for heterogeneous stacking of the local models compared to homogeneous stacking. Further analysis of the global heterogeneous CNN model determined that the optimum placement of the sensors on human limbs resulted in better activity recognition.

"Despite having one of the most advanced healthcare systems in the world, Japan is expected to experience a shortage of nearly half a million healthcare workers by 2025 due to its rapidly aging population. In response, government authorities plan to implement a wide range of AI-driven healthcare solutions. These include care robots that assist the physically handicapped or elderly, chatbots that provide anonymous online mental health consultation, and diagnostic software utilizing machine learning. Yet one of the most popular smart technologies to augment the nation's already overstrained and undermanned healthcare system is a little known but emerging emotional AI technologies, i.e., deep learning systems trained to read, classify, and respond to human emotions. These technologies are being sold on a commercial level not only to the public but also to rehabilitation centers, local hospitals, and senior citizen residences. Although the augmentation of healthcare services to intelligent machines may seem like a logical step in a country well-known for its long-standing affection toward robots, Japanese society is also known for its adherence to established social relations and traditional institutional practices, especially, in the realm of medical care. In order to gauge Japanese acceptance of emotion-sensing technology, we analyze a dataset of 245 visitors to clinics and hospitals in a typical suburban area in Japan using multiple linear regression. The results show that in general, senior and male patients perceive the emotional AI technology more negatively. For behavioral variables, patients' level of familiarity has positive correlations with attitudes toward emotional AI-based applications in private setting (βFamiliarity_AttitudePri=0.346, p<0.001) and public setting (βFamiliarity_PublicAttitude=0.297, p<0.001); while concern for losing control to AI has negative correlations with the attitudes' variables: private setting (βLosingControl_AttitudePri=−0.262,p=0.002) and public setting (β LosingControl_AttitudePub=-0.188, p=0.044). Interestingly, concerns over violation of privacy and discrimination are non-significant correlates, which contradict the emerging literature on this subject. We further contextualize the findings with insights afforded by an understanding of Japanese culture as well as the relevant literature on care robots in Japan. Finally, policy and education implications to promote emotional AI acceptance to the general and senior members of the society are provided. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",3,10.1016/j.techsoc.2022.102166,"This paper analyzes the acceptance of emotional AI technologies in Japan's healthcare system, focusing on patient attitudes and cultural factors.

"Problem definition: Machine learning is often employed in appointment scheduling to identify the patients with the greatest no-show risk, so as to schedule them into or right after overbooked slots. That scheduling decision maximizes the clinic performance, as measured by a weighted sum of all patients’ waiting time and the provider’s overtime and idle time. However, if a racial group is characterized by a higher no-show risk, then the patients belonging to that racial group will be scheduled into or right after overbooked slots disproportionately to the general population. Academic/Practical Relevance: That scheduling decision is problematic because patients scheduled in those slots tend to have a worse service experience than the other patients, as measured by the time they spend in the waiting room. Thus, the challenge becomes minimizing the schedule cost while avoiding racial disparities. Methodology: Motivated by the real-world case of a large specialty clinic whose black patients have a higher no-show probability than non-black patients, we analytically study racial disparity in this context. Then, we propose new objective functions that minimize both schedule cost and racial disparity and that can be readily adopted by researchers and practitioners. We develop a race-aware objective, which instead of minimizing the waiting times of all patients, minimizes the waiting times of the racial group expected to wait the longest. We also develop race-unaware methodologies that do not consider race explicitly. We validate our findings both on simulated and real-world data. Results: We demonstrate that state-of-the-art scheduling systems cause the black patients in our data set to wait about 30% longer than nonblack patients. Our race-aware methodology achieves both goals of eliminating racial disparity and obtaining a similar schedule cost as that obtained by the state-of-the-art scheduling method, whereas the race-unaware methodologies fail to obtain both efficiency and fairness. Managerial implications: Our work uncovers that the traditional objective of minimizing schedule cost may lead to unintended racial disparities. Both efficiency and fairness can be achieved by adopting a race-aware objective. © 2021 The Author(s)",3,10.1287/msom.2021.0999,"This paper investigates the impact of machine learning on appointment scheduling, specifically addressing racial disparities in no-show risks.

"Purpose: Nowadays, the digitized economy and technological advancements are increasing at a faster pace. One such technology that is gaining popularity in the healthcare sector is Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI has been debated much, searched so well due to the implications, issues and for its benefits in terms of ease, it will offer. The following research has focused on examining the ethical dilemmas associated with AI when it will be introduced in the healthcare sector. Design/methodology/approach: A narrative review method focusing on content analysis has been used in the research. The authors have employed a deductive approach to determine the ethical facets of adopting AI in the healthcare sector. The current study is complemented by a review of related studies. The secondary data have been collected from authentic resources available on the Internet. Findings: Patient privacy, biased results, patient safety and Human errors are some major ethical dilemmas that are likely to be faced once AI will be introduced in healthcare. The impact of ethical dilemmas can be minimized by continuous monitoring but cannot be eliminated in full if AI is introduced in healthcare. AI overall will increase the performance of the healthcare sector. However, we need to address some recommendations to mitigate the ethical potential issues that we could observe using AI. Technological change and AI can mimic the overall intellectual process of humans, which increases its credibility and also offers harm to humans. Originality/value: Patient safety is the most crucial ethical concern because AI is a new technology and technology can lead to failure. Thus, we need to be certain that these new technological developments are ethically applied. The authors need to evaluate and assess the organizational and legal progress associated with the emergence of AI in the healthcare sector.

"The growth of big data is transforming many economic sectors, including the medical and healthcare sector. Despite this, research into the practical application of data analytics to the development of health policy is still limited. In this study we examine how data science and machine learning methods can be applied to a variety of open health datasets, including GP prescribing data, disease prevalence data and economic deprivation data. This paper discusses the context of mental health and antidepressant prescribing in Northern Ireland and highlights its importance as a public policy issue. A hypothesis is proposed, suggesting that the link between antidepressant usage and economic deprivation is mediated by depression prevalence. An analysis of various heterogeneous open datasets is used to test this hypothesis. A description of the methodology is provided, including the open health datasets under investigation and an explanation of the data processing pipeline. Correlations between key variables and several different clustering analyses are presented. Evidence is provided which suggests that the depression prevalence hypothesis is flawed.

"Purpose: This paper aims to maintain the high service quality of the long-term care service providers by establishing a knowledge-based system so as to enhance the service quality of nursing homes and the performance of its nursing staff continually. Design/methodology/approach: An intelligent case-based knowledge management system (ICKMS) is developed with the integration of two artificial intelligence techniques, i.e. fuzzy logic and case-based reasoning (CBR). In the system, fuzzy logic is adopted to assess the performance through the analysis of the long-term care services provided, nurse performance and elderly satisfaction, whereas CBR is used to formulate a customized re-training program for quality improvement. A case study is conducted to validate the feasibility of the proposed system. Findings: The empirical findings indicate that the ICKMS helps in identification of those nursing staff who cannot meet the essential service standard. Through the customized re-training program, the performance of the nursing staff can be greatly enhanced, whereas the medical errors and complaints can be considerably reduced. Furthermore, the proposed methodology provides a cost-saving approach in the administrative work.

"While artificial intelligence (AI) and other automation technologies might lead to enormous progress in healthcare, they may also have undesirable consequences for people working in the field. In this interdisciplinary study, we capture empirical evidence of not only what healthcare work could be automated using current technology, but also what should be automated. We investigate these research questions by utilizing probabilistic machine learning models trained on thousands of expert ratings, provided by both healthcare practitioners and automation experts. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to analyze the desirability of automating healthcare work activities (human workforce preferences) in combination with current technological capabilities. We present a succinct four quadrant model, the Automatability-Desirability Matrix, based on our findings. It can be used to support policymakers and organizational leaders in developing practical strategies on how to harness the positive power of AI, while accompanying change and empowering stakeholders in a participatory fashion. Furthermore, we observe that healthcare professionals desire a surprisingly high proportion of their work activities to be fully automated, while being less optimistic about the current automation potential of healthcare work than technical experts. Our results represent the first detailed quantitative empirical evidence of healthcare practitioners’ preferences regarding the automation of work and the first direct comparison of the potential for automation as based on the perspectives of technical experts and those working as healthcare practitioners. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",3,10.1016/j.techfore.2021.120967,This study investigates the automation potential in healthcare using probabilistic machine learning models to analyze expert ratings.

"We study the problem a diagnostic expert (e.g., a physician) faces when offering a diagnosis to a client (e.g., a patient) that may be based only on the expert’s own diagnostic ability or supplemented by a diagnostic test—conventional and artificial intelligence (AI) tools alike—revealing the client’s true condition. The expert’s diagnostic ability (or type) is private information. The expert is impurely altruistic in that the expert cares about both the client’s utility and the expert’s own reputational payoff that depends on the peer perception of the expert’s diagnostic ability. The decision of whether to perform the test, which is costly for the client, provides the expert with an opportunity to influence that perception. We show a unique separating equilibrium exists in which the high-type expert does not resort to diagnostic testing and offers a diagnosis based only on the expert’s own diagnostic ability, whereas the low-type expert performs the test. Furthermore, we establish that high-type expert may skip necessary diagnostic tests to separate them from the low-type expert. Interestingly, the effect of reputational payoff on undertesting is nonmonotonic, and the desire to appear of high type leads to undertesting only when the reputational payoff is intermediate. Our results also suggest a more altruistic expert may be more likely to engage in undertesting. Furthermore, efforts to encourage testing by providing financial incentives or by raising malpractice lawsuit concerns may, surprisingly, help fuel undertesting in the equilibrium.

"In healthcare, gender and sex considerations are crucial because they affect individuals' health and disease differences. Yet, most algorithms deployed in the healthcare context do not consider these aspects and do not account for bias detection. Missing these dimensions in algorithms used in medicine is a huge point of concern, as neglecting these aspects will inevitably produce far from optimal results and generate errors that may lead to misdiagnosis and potential discrimination. This paper explores how current algorithmic-based systems may reinforce gender biases and affect marginalized communities in healthcare-related applications. To do so, we bring together notions and reflections from computer science, queer media studies, and legal insights to better understand the magnitude of failing to consider gender and sex difference in the use of algorithms for medical purposes. Our goal is to illustrate the potential impact that algorithmic bias may have on inadvertent discriminatory, safety, and privacy-related concerns for patients in increasingly automated medicine. This is necessary because by rushing the deployment of AI technologies that do not account for diversity, we risk having an even more unsafe and inadequate healthcare delivery. By promoting the account for privacy, safety, diversity, and inclusion in algorithmic developments with health-related outcomes, we ultimately aim to inform the Artificial Intelligence (AI) global governance landscape and practice on the importance of integrating gender and sex considerations in the development of algorithms to avoid exacerbating existing or new prejudices. © 2022 Eduard Fosch-Villaronga, Hadassah Drukarch, Pranav Khanna, Tessa Verhoef, Bart Custers",3,10.1016/j.clsr.2022.105735,This paper investigates the impact of gender and sex considerations on algorithmic bias in healthcare applications.

"The role of artificial intelligence (AI) in augmenting healthcare is expected to grow substantially in future decades. Current research in medical AI focuses on developing, validating, and implementing point-level AI applications in an ad hoc manner. To harness the full power of AI to improve the patient experience and outcomes at a societal scale, however, requires a gestalt shift—with a systematic understanding of AI in the context of healthcare—and so results in its widespread adoption. This translates to four pillars of incorporating AI into healthcare workflow, including physician buy-in, patient acceptance, provider investment, and payer support (the “4Ps”). To achieve these 4Ps, it is imperative to design AI-augmented healthcare delivery systems in view of (1) how physicians integrate AI into their clinical practice and (2) how patients perceive the role of AI in healthcare delivery. This will in turn boost provider investment and payer support. In this paper, we draw from the literature to discuss a series of research questions, including barriers to physician buy-in and patient acceptance, transparency and disclosure, service design, and strategies for increasing AI uptake.

"Effective and rapid triaging from primary care into secondary care plays a pivotal role in providing patients with timely treatment and managing increasing demands for healthcare resources. Existing triaging methods from primary care to secondary care are labor-intensive processes that involve manually reviewing referral data from multiple sources and can cause long referral to treatment time. There has been no research using machine learning methods that automatically analyzes heterogeneous data including referral letters to recognize regularities to support the primary to secondary care triage.

"Online medical platform is a platform for patients to post their medical experience, collect medical information, and link doctors and patients for related medical activities. As the number of patients and doctors registered on the platform increases, there is an urgent need to consider how patients can identify useful information from the vast amount of information to help them make medical choices, and how the platform can provide distinctive medical choices based on the risk preferences of patients. In this paper, we propose a decision-making model that integrates a machine-learning method and a multi-criteria decision-making method to help patients to select physicians based on user-generated content considering interactive criteria and risk preferences of patients. Firstly, by data mining methods, various criteria included in user-generated content that influence patients' selection behavior are retrieved to construct a physician evaluation system. Secondly, a sentiment analysis method based on a medical review corpus is developed to mine satisfaction information from text reviews.

"Many researchers have documented how AI and data driven technologies have the potential to have profound effects on our lives—in ways that make these technologies stand out from those that went before. Around the world, we are seeing a significant growth in interest and investment in AI in healthcare. This has been coupled with rising concerns about the ethical implications of these technologies and an array of ethical guidelines for the use of AI and data in healthcare has arisen. Nevertheless, the question of if and how AI and data technologies can be ethical remains open to debate. This paper aims to contribute to this debate by considering the wide range of implications that have been attributed to these technologies and asking whether current ethical guidelines take these factors into account. In particular, the paper argues that while current ethics guidelines for AI in healthcare effectively account for the four key issues identified in the ethics literature (transparency; fairness; responsibility and privacy), they have largely neglected wider issues relating to the way in which these technologies shape institutional and social arrangements. This, I argue, has given current ethics guidelines a strong focus on evaluating the impact of these technologies on the individual, while not accounting for the powerful social shaping effects of these technologies. To address this, the paper proposes a Multiscale Ethics Framework, which aims to help technology developers and ethical evaluations to consider the wider implications of these technologies. © 2022, The Author(s).",3,10.1007/s11948-022-00396-z,"This paper discusses the ethical implications of AI and data technologies in healthcare, critiquing existing ethical guidelines for their narrow focus on individual impacts rather than broader social effects.

"Digital technologies adoption includes the Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, has become a topic of utmost interest over the last decade. Healthcare sectors across the developed countries have already started adopting digital technologies in their service delivery scapes. However, in developing countries like India, the healthcare service sector has yet to take full advantage of such digital technology-enabled platforms to transform itself while catering to patients, managers, physicians, and healthcare practitioners. Thus, there is a need for a conceptual understanding with an overarching goal of clarifying the outcomes of digital technologies adoption on healthcare services and its orchestration. This paper analyses the impact of digitized healthcare technology adoption on the transparency and orchestration aspect of care services empirically. The theoretical relationships between digital technologies adaptation with care service transparency and orchestration have been validated here and also analyze path linkages through Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). The results of SEM highlight the fact that the adoption of digitized technology platforms can achieve care service-orchestration. This study results, supporting the hypotheses for achieving care service orchestration, might pave the way and motivate potential sets of hospitals, characterized by decision dilemma, waiting at the verge of digital technology adoption in the healthcare context, especially in the Indian subcontinental context. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",3,10.1016/j.techsoc.2021.101568,"This paper empirically analyzes the impact of adopting digital technologies, including AI, on healthcare service transparency and orchestration in India.

"Artificial intelligence (AI) is an emerging technological system that provides a platform to manage and analyze data by emulating human cognitive functions with greater accuracy, revolutionizing patient care and introducing a paradigm shift to the healthcare industry. The purpose of this study is to identify the underlying factors that affect the adoption of artificial intelligence in healthcare (AIH) by healthcare providers and to understand “What are the factors that influence healthcare providers’ behavioral intentions to adopt AIH in their routine practice?” An integrated survey was conducted among healthcare providers, including consultants, residents/students, and nurses. The survey included items related to performance expectancy, effort expectancy, initial trust, personal innovativeness, task complexity, and technology characteristics. The collected data were analyzed using structural equation modeling. A total of 392 healthcare professionals participated in the survey, with 72.4% being male and 50.7% being 30 years old or younger. The results showed that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and initial trust have a positive influence on the behavioral intentions of healthcare providers to use AIH. Personal innovativeness was found to have a positive influence on effort expectancy, while task complexity and technology characteristics have a positive influence on effort expectancy for AIH. The study’s empirically validated model sheds light on healthcare providers’ intention to adopt AIH, while the study’s findings can be used to develop strategies to encourage this adoption.

"Background: Operating rooms are the core of hospitals. They are a primary source of revenue and are often seen as one of the bottlenecks in the medical system. Many efforts are made to increase throughput, reduce costs, and maximize incomes, as well as optimize clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction. We trained a predictive model on the length of surgeries to improve the productivity and utility of operative rooms in general hospitals. Methods: We collected clinical and administrative data for the last 10 years from two large general public hospitals in Israel. We trained a machine learning model to give the expected length of surgery using pre-operative data. These data included diagnoses, laboratory tests, risk factors, demographics, procedures, anesthesia type, and the main surgeon’s level of experience. We compared our model to a naïve model that represented current practice. Findings: Our prediction model achieved better performance than the naïve model and explained almost 70% of the variance in surgery durations. Interpretation: A machine learning-based model can be a useful approach for increasing operating room utilization. Among the most important factors were the type of procedures and the main surgeon’s level of experience. The model enables the harmonizing of hospital productivity through wise scheduling and matching suitable teams for a variety of clinical procedures for the benefit of the individual patient and the system as a whole. © 2022 by the authors.

"Background Health care organizations are integrating a variety of machine learning (ML)-based clinical decision support (CDS) tools into their operations, but practitioners lack clear guidance regarding how to implement these tools so that they assist end users in their work. Purpose We designed this study to identify how health care organizations can facilitate collaborative development of ML-based CDS tools to enhance their value for health care delivery in real-world settings. Methodology/Approach We utilized qualitative methods, including 37 interviews in a large, multispecialty health system that developed and implemented two operational ML-based CDS tools in two of its hospital sites. We performed thematic analyses to inform presentation of an explanatory framework and recommendations. Results We found that ML-based CDS tool development and implementation into clinical workflows proceeded in four phases: iterative solution coidentification, iterative coengagement, iterative coapplication, and iterative corefinement. Each phase is characterized by a collaborative back-and-forth process between the technology's developers and users, through which both users' activities and the technology itself are transformed. Conclusion Health care organizations that anticipate iterative collaboration to be an integral aspect of their ML-based CDS tools' development and implementation process may have more success in deploying ML-based CDS tools that assist end users in their work than organizations that expect a traditional technology innovation process. Practice Implications Managers developing and implementing ML-based CDS tools should frame the work as a collaborative learning opportunity for both users and the technology itself and should solicit constructive feedback from users on potential changes to the technology, in addition to potential changes to user workflows, in an ongoing, iterative manner.  © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",3,10.1097/HMR.0000000000000324,"This study focuses on the implementation of machine learning-based clinical decision support (CDS) tools in healthcare organizations.

"The widespread lockdowns imposed in many countries at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic elevated the importance of research on pandemic management when medical solutions such as vaccines are unavailable. We present a framework that combines a standard epidemiological SEIR (susceptible–exposed–infected–removed) model with an equally standard machine learning classification model for clinical severity risk, defined as an individual's risk of needing intensive care unit (ICU) treatment if infected. Using COVID-19–related data and estimates for France as of spring 2020, we then simulate isolation and exit policies. Our simulations show that policies considering clinical risk predictions could relax isolation restrictions for millions of the lowest risk population months earlier while consistently abiding by ICU capacity restrictions. Exit policies without risk predictions, meanwhile, would considerably exceed ICU capacity or require the isolation of a substantial portion of population for over a year in order to not overwhelm the medical system. Sensitivity analyses further decompose the impact of various elements of our models on the observed effects. Our work indicates that predictive modeling based on machine learning and artificial intelligence could bring significant value to managing pandemics. Such a strategy, however, requires governments to develop policies and invest in infrastructure to operationalize personalized isolation and exit policies based on risk predictions at scale. This includes health data policies to train predictive models and apply them to all residents, as well as policies for targeted resource allocation to maintain strict isolation for high-risk individuals. © 2022 The Authors.

"The issue of harnessing machine learning (ML) algorithms for the prediction of adverse medical events is important considering the prevalence of vast repositories of patient-level medical data, and the quest to reduce healthcare costs while elevating the quality of care. Of particular interest is identifying a set of features that can better predict the risk of unplanned readmissions of chronically ill patients within 30 days post discharge, among them patients with Congestive Heart Failure (CHF). While numerous studies have employed ML algorithms to identify sets of significant features, only a handful have compared features extracted by various methods, and even fewer have compared the predictive power of feature sets selected by human experts to those selected by ML. Hence, this research aimed to elicit a comprehensive feature set selected by four ML algorithms and compare its predictive performance to that of a feature set selected by experts. We then evaluated a merged list of the two feature sets, constructing a human-machine collaborative set to predict the likelihood of 30-day unplanned readmission of CHF patients using data on 10,763 CHF patients hospitalized during the years 2010–2017. Our models achieved Area under the ROC Curve (AUC) above 0.8 and an Accuracy of ∼0.89, comparable to the best models in the extant literature.

"AI applications hold great potential for improving healthcare. However, successfully operating AI is a complex endeavor requiring organizations to establish adequate management approaches. Managing AI applications requires functioning information exchange between a diverse set of stakeholders. Lacking information processing among stakeholders increases task uncertainty, hampering the operation of AI applications.

"Purpose: Hospitals recently search for more accurate forecasting systems, given the unpredictable demand and the increasing occurrence of disruptive incidents (mass casualty incidents, pandemics and natural disasters). Besides, the incorporation of automatic inventory and replenishment systems – that hospitals are undertaking – requires developed and accurate forecasting systems.

"Currently more economically developed countries (MEDCs) are facing a painful shortage of caregivers, while the need for their abilities is growing. The caregivers' capacity bottleneck is aggravated by the counter-directional development in terms of economic efficiency Input (= availability of caregivers' capacity) and Output (= fulfillment of qualitative and quantitative care requirements). It is necessary to introduce a 'New Efficiency' concept for social service providers in the eldercare sector. In order to warrant feasibility of process output without cost reduction of the elder care process, this paper focuses on the optimization of process organization and, specifically, analyzes the impact of digitization on services in long-term nursing homes. In this context 'New Efficiency' is an enabling paradigm to ensure the attainment of qualitative and quantitative care requirements by optimization of process input. The usefulness of the New Efficiency' for long-term caring processes is discussed in the context of nutritional care and logistic processes.

"The concept of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) provides a clear and comprehensible explanation for the reasoning behind a system's output, allowing users to understand the context in which it operates. In the realm of Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS), XAI is particularly crucial, as it helps healthcare professionals (HCPs) in their decision-making processes. Without XAI, there is a risk of over-reliance on the system's output, potentially leading to subpar results. Despite the numerous benefits that XAI-enhanced CDSS hold in the healthcare industry, there has been a limited number of studies examining their implementation and acceptance. Thus, the objective of this study was to examine the adoption of XAI-based CDSS through the Stimulus-Organism-Response model. The sample consisted of 172 HCPs from Malaysian public and private hospitals, and the research model was tested using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) in conjunction with the bootstrapping method. The results showed a significant positive correlation between the stimulus factors of informed action, transparent interaction, and representational fidelity and the positive attitude towards XAI-based CDSS as an organism factor. Additionally, the study found that attitude was a significant predictor of the intention to adopt as a response factor.

"The integration of cutting-edge technology, such as cloud computing and Clinical Decision Support (CDS) algorithms, is radically altering the healthcare system. This research digs into how Inference Engines, Bayesian Networks, Machine Learning Algorithms, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) have all played critical roles in reshaping the healthcare industry. Medical professionals may more efficiently use CDS algorithms thanks to cloud-based technologies that streamline data storage, sharing, and processing. Decision-making is aided by Inference Engines because they provide organized insights based on preset criteria. This is where Bayesian Networks come in, with their ability to represent complicated, probabilistic interactions among variables for exact diagnoses and risk assessment. Machine learning algorithms improve predictive analysis by identifying trends in large datasets, paving the way for more individualized approaches to medical care.

"AgeTech involves the use of emerging technologies to support the health, well-being and independent living of older adults. In this paper we focus on how AgeTech based on artificial intelligence (AI) may better support older adults to remain in their own living environment for longer, provide social connectedness, support wellbeing and mental health, and enable social participation. In order to assess and better understand the positive as well as negative outcomes of AI-based AgeTech, a critical analysis of ethical design, digital equity, and policy pathways is required. A crucial question is how AI-based AgeTech may drive practical, equitable, and inclusive multilevel solutions to support healthy, active ageing.In our paper, we aim to show that a focus on equity is key for AI-based AgeTech if it is to realize its full potential. We propose that equity should not just be an extra benefit or minimum requirement, but the explicit aim of designing AI-based health tech. This means that social determinants that affect the use of or access to these technologies have to be addressed. We will explore how complexity management as a crucial element of AI-based AgeTech may potentially create and exacerbate social inequities by marginalising or ignoring social determinants. We identify bias, standardization, and access as main ethical issues in this context and subsequently, make recommendations as to how inequities that stem form AI-based AgeTech can be addressed. © 2022.

Background There is an urgent need to achieve sepsis' early detection and diagnostic excellence. Methods A qualitative study based on semi-structured interviews conducted at the target site and across other Italian hospitals. A content analysis was undertaken, emergent themes were selected and categorized, and interviews were conducted until saturation was reached. Results Sixteen nurses (10 at the target site and six across other hospitals) and nine non-nursing professionals (seven at the target site and two across other hospitals) were interviewed. An organizational redesign was identified as the primary adoption driver. Even though nurses perceived workload increase related to the machine-learning component, technology acceptability was relatively high, as the standardization of tasks was perceived as crucial to improving professional satisfaction.

"Objective The PULsE-AI trial sought to determine the effectiveness of a screening strategy that included a machine learning risk prediction algorithm in conjunction with diagnostic testing for identification of undiagnosed atrial fibrillation (AF) in primary care. This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of implementing the screening strategy in a real-world setting. Methods Data from the PULsE-AI trial - a prospective, randomized, controlled trial conducted across six general practices in England from June 2019 to February 2021 - were used to inform a cost-effectiveness analysis that included a hybrid screening decision tree and Markov AF disease progression model. Model outcomes were reported at both individual- and population-level (estimated UK population >= 30 years of age at high-risk of undiagnosed AF) and included number of patients screened, number of AF cases identified, mean total and incremental costs (screening, events, treatment), quality-adjusted-life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Results The screening strategy was estimated to result in 45,493 new diagnoses of AF across the high-risk population in the UK (3.3 million), and an estimated additional 14,004 lifetime diagnoses compared with routine care only. Per-patient costs for high-risk individuals who underwent the screening strategy were estimated at 1,985 pound (vs 1,888 pound for individuals receiving routine care only). At a population-level, the screening strategy was associated with a cost increase of approximately 322 pound million and an increase of 81,000 QALYs. The screening strategy demonstrated cost-effectiveness versus routine care only at an accepted ICER threshold of 20,000 pound per QALY-gained, with an ICER of 3,994 pound/QALY. Conclusions Compared with routine care only, it is cost-effective to target individuals at high risk of undiagnosed AF, through an AF risk prediction algorithm, who should then undergo diagnostic testing. This AF risk prediction algorithm can reduce the number of patients needed to be screened to identify undiagnosed AF, thus alleviating primary care burden.",3,10.1080/13696998.2022.2102355,This study evaluates the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a screening strategy that incorporates a machine learning risk prediction algorithm for identifying undiagnosed atrial fibrillation (AF) in primary care.

"The Italian National Healthcare Service relies on per capita allocation for healthcare funds, despite having a highly detailed and wide range of data to potentially build a complex risk-adjustment formula. However, heterogeneity in data availability limits the development of a national model. This paper implements and ealuates machine learning (ML) and standard risk-adjustment models on different data scenarios that a Region or Country may face, to optimize information with the most predictive model. We show that ML achieves a small but generally statistically insignificant improvement of adjusted R-2 and mean squared error with fine data granularity compared to linear regression, while in coarse granularity and poor range of variables scenario no differences were observed. The advantage of ML algorithms is greater in the coarse granularity and fair/rich range of variables set and limited with fine granularity scenarios.

"Aims: As many cases of atrial fibrillation (AF) are asymptomatic, patients often remain undiagnosed until complications (e.g. stroke) manifest. Risk-prediction algorithms may help to efficiently identify people with undiagnosed AF. However, the cost-effectiveness of targeted screening remains uncertain. This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of targeted screening, informed by a machine learning (ML) risk prediction algorithm, to identify patients with AF. Methods: Cost-effectiveness analyses were undertaken utilizing a hybrid screening decision tree and Markov disease progression model. Costs and outcomes associated with the detection of AF compared traditional systematic and opportunistic AF screening strategies to targeted screening informed by a ML risk prediction algorithm. Model analyses were based on adults >= 50 years and adopted the UK NHS perspective. Results: Targeted screening using the ML risk prediction algorithm required fewer patients to be screened (61 per 1,000 patients, compared to 534 and 687 patients in the systematic and opportunistic strategies) and detected more AF cases (11 per 1,000 patients, compared to 6 and 8 AF cases in the systematic and opportunistic screening strategies). The targeted approach demonstrated cost-effectiveness under base case settings (cost per QALY gained of 4,847 pound and 5,544 pound against systematic and opportunistic screening respectively). The targeted screening strategy was predicted to provide an additional 3.40 and 2.05 QALYs per 1,000 patients screened versus systematic and opportunistic strategies. The targeted screening strategy remained cost-effective in all scenarios evaluated. Limitations: The analysis relied on assumptions that include the extended period of patient life span and the lack of consideration for treatment discontinuations/switching, as well as the assumption that the ML risk-prediction algorithm will identify asymptomatic AF. Conclusions: Targeted screening using a ML risk prediction algorithm has the potential to enhance the clinical and cost-effectiveness of AF screening, improving health outcomes through efficient use of limited healthcare resources.",3,10.1080/13696998.2019.1706543,This study assesses the cost-effectiveness of targeted screening for atrial fibrillation (AF) using a machine learning risk prediction algorithm.

This study aimed to use machine learning approaches and big data to predict high-cost users among people with cardiovascular disease (CVD).MethodsWe used nationally representative linked datasets in New Zealand to predict CVD prevalent cases with the most expensive cost belonging to the top quintiles by cost. We compared the performance of four popular machine learning models (L1-regularised logistic regression, classification trees, k-nearest neighbourhood (KNN) and random forest) with the traditional regression models.ResultsThe machine learning models had far better accuracy in predicting high health-cost users compared with the logistic models. The harmony score F1 (combining sensitivity and positive predictive value) of the machine learning models ranged from 30.6% to 41.2% (compared with 8.6-9.1% for the logistic models). Previous health costs, income, age, chronic health conditions, deprivation, and receiving a social security benefit were among the most important predictors of the CVD high-cost users.ConclusionsThis study provides additional evidence that machine learning can be used as a tool together with big data in health economics for identification of new risk factors and prediction of high-cost users with CVD.

"Doula services represent an underutilized maternal and child health intervention with the potential to improve outcomes through the provision of physical, emotional, and informational support. However, there is limited evidence of the infant health effects of doulas despite well-established connections between maternal and infant health. Moreover, because the availability of doulas is limited and often not covered by insurers, existing evidence leaves unclear if or how doula services should be allocated to achieve the greatest improvements in outcomes. We use unique data and machine learning to develop accurate predictive models of infant health and doula service participation. We then combine these predictive models within the double machine learning method to estimate the effects of doula services. We show that while doula services reduce risk on average, the benefits of doula services increase as the risk of negative infant health outcomes increases. We compare these benefits to the costs of doula services under alternative allocation schemes and show that leveraging the risk predictions dramatically increases the cost effectiveness of doula services.

"AimsUse of gene expression signatures to predict adjuvant chemotherapy benefit in women with early-stage breast cancer is increasing. However, high cost, limited access, and eligibility for these tests results in the adoption of less precise assessment approaches. This study evaluates the cost impact of PreciseDx Breast (PDxBr), an AI-augmented histopathology platform that assesses the 6-year risk of recurrence in early-stage invasive breast cancer patients to help improve informed use of adjuvant chemotherapy.Materials and methodsA decision-tree Markov model was developed to compare the costs of treatment guided by standard of care (SOC) risk assessment (i.e. clinical diagnostic workup with or without Oncotype DX) versus PDxBr with SOC in a hypothetical cohort of U.S. women with early-stage invasive breast cancer. A commercial payer perspective compares costs of testing, adjuvant therapy, recurrence, adverse events, surveillance, and end-of-life care.ResultsPDxBr use in prognostic evaluation resulted in savings of $4 million (M) in year one compared to current SOC in 1 M females members. Over 6-years, savings increased to $12.5 M. The per-treated patient costs in year one amounted to $19.5 thousand (K) for SOC and $16.9K for PDxBr.LimitationsFor simplicity, recurrence was not specified. We performed scenario analyses to account for variations in rates for local, regional, and distant recurrence. Second, a recurrent patient incurs the total cost of treated recurrence in the first year and goes back to remission or death. Third, CDK4/6i treatment is only incorporated in the recurrence costs but not in the first line of treatment for early-stage breast cancer due to limited data.ConclusionsSensitivity analyses demonstrated robust overall savings to changes in all variables in the model.

"Aim To evaluate the U.S. payer budget-impact of KidneyIntelX, an artificial intelligence-enabled in vitro diagnostic to predict kidney function decline in Type 2 Diabetic Kidney Disease (T2DKD) patients, stages 1-3b. Materials and methods We developed an Excel-based model according to International Society of Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) good practices to assess U.S. payer budget impact associated with the use of the KidneyIntelX test to optimize therapy T2DKD patients compared to standard of care (SOC) (without KidneyIntelX). A hypothetical cohort of 100,000 stages 1-3b T2DKD patients was followed for 5 years. Peer-reviewed publications were used to identify model parameter estimates. KidneyIntelX costs incremental to SOC (without KidneyIntelX) included test cost, additional prescription medication use, specialist referrals and PCP office visits. Patients managed with KidneyIntelX experienced a 20% slowed progression rate compared to SOC (without KidneyIntelX) attributed to slowed DKD progression, delayed or prevented dialysis and transplants, and reduced dialysis crashes. Associated costs were compared to SOC (without KidneyIntelX). Sensitivity analyses were conducted by varying the definition of progression and the DKD progression rate associated with KidneyIntelX testing and related interventions. Results Projected undiscounted base case 5-year savings for 100,000 patients tested with KidneyIntelX were $1.052 billion, attributed mostly to slowed progression through DKD stages. The breakeven point for the health plan adopting KidneyIntelX is expected to occur prior to year 2 after adoption.

"Objectives: The machine learning prediction model Pacmed Critical (PC), currently under development, may guide intensivists in their decision-making process on the most appropriate time to discharge a patient from the intensive care unit (ICU). Given the financial pressure on healthcare budgets, this study assessed whether PC has the potential to be cost-effective compared with standard care, without the use of PC, for Dutch patients in the ICU from a societal perspective. Methods: A 1-year, 7-state Markov model reflecting the ICU care pathway and incorporating the PC decision tool was developed. A hypothetical cohort of 1000 adult Dutch patients admitted in the ICU was entered in the model. We used the literature, expert opinion, and data from Amsterdam University Medical Center for model parameters. The uncertainty surrounding the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was assessed using deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses and scenario analyses. Results: PC was a cost-effective strategy with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of euro18 507 per quality-adjusted life-year. PC remained cost-effective over standard care in multiple scenarios and sensitivity analyses.

"Carcinoma cervix is one of the leading causes of death among females worldwide. WHO has put forth the 90-70-90 global strategy for elimination of cervical cancer. It calls for 70% women to be screened at least once in their lifetime. This is as low as 1.9% for India and even lower for many other countries. Studying patient journeys, process mapping and counterfactual analysis helped to better understand the problem. Weaknesses of our system include availability, accessibility, affordability, skewed distribution of infrastructure, cost implications and limited specialist manpower. The strengths of our system are the key change drivers like existing network of primary healthcare workers, changes in health seeking behavior due to COVID-19 with increasing role of tele-health, conducive political milieu with initiatives like Digital India Mission and booming start-up ecosystem. On connecting the dots, what we need is a solution that is inexpensive, socially acceptable, does not require women to visit health centers, does not require additional government budgetary allocation and something that the industry/start-ups would be keen on taking up. An artificial intelligence-based solution like ""Smart-Colpo"" can be a good fit. It can be a potential ""Loss-Leader"" for industry players, helping them build network, acquire potential customers in rural India and usher in data-driven revenue models and cross-subsidization.

"Diagnostic errors are common and can result in serious patient harm. Making the right diagnosis often requires significant diagnostic effort. Yet most physician payment schemes are procedure based and do not account for diagnostic effort or accuracy because of observability issues. In this paper, we develop a parsimonious model to examine the impact of a physician payment scheme on a physician's decisions to (1) exert diagnostic effort and (2) perform a confirmatory test. High effort provides an informative (though imperfect) signal of the patient's true state; the test is confirmatory in that it is a prerequisite for diagnosing a severe condition. Our model uses a two-step diagnostic process to capture the interaction between the physician's diagnostic effort and testing decisions. We show that under a fee-for-service payment scheme, the physician may view the diagnostic effort and the confirmatory test as either complementary or substitutive, depending on the additional revenue from testing. We also reveal nonmonotonic properties such that a more patient-centered physician may not exert more effort or provide a more accurate diagnosis. In addition, either a flat or differentiated payment scheme may be optimal. We also show that an alternative payment scheme, under which the revenue from the confirmatory test is contingent on its result, can induce the social optimum under certain conditions. With the advent of artificial intelligence as part of the standard of care and its increasing use as confirmatory tests, our research has implications for the design of physician payment systems in light of concerns about the potential erosion of individual attention.",3,10.1287/mnsc.2023.4937,"This paper develops a model to analyze how physician payment schemes influence diagnostic effort and testing decisions.

"When consumers gain Medicaid, their cost of healthcare changes. The direction of this change determines how utilization changes. The previously uninsured see a stark decrease in the price of primary care after gaining public insurance. Due to charity care, they may face an increase in the price of emergency department care. The previously insured see a reduction in emergency department prices and decreased access to primary care. We examine the impact of the prior insurance status of the newly publicly insured on substitution between healthcare. We base our identification on California's LIHP and ACA Medicaid expansions. One challenge we face is estimating crowd-out. We use machine learning techniques to predict prior insurance status based on observable covariates in cross-sectional data. We find an increase in emergency department utilization caused entirely by those crowded-out whose access to primary care has decreased. We find the opposite utilization patterns for the previously uninsured.",3,10.1016/j.jhealeco.2021.102542,"This paper investigates the impact of Medicaid expansion on healthcare utilization, focusing on how prior insurance status affects consumer behavior.

"The COVID-19 pandemic has spurred extensive vaccine research worldwide. One crucial part of vaccine development is the phase III clinical trial that assesses the vaccine for safety and efficacy in the prevention of COVID-19. In this work, we enumerate the first successful implementation of using machine learning models to accelerate phase III vaccine trials, working with the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine to predictively select trial sites with naturally high incidence rates (""hotspots""). We develop DELPHI, a novel, accurate, policy-driven machine learning model that serves as the basis of our predictions. During the second half of 2020, the DELPHI-driven site selection identified hotspots with more than 90% accuracy, shortened trial duration by six to eight weeks (approximately 33%), and reduced enrollment by 15,000 (approximately 25%). In turn, this accelerated time to market enabled Janssen's vaccine to receive its emergency use authorization and realize its public health impact earlier than expected. Several geographies identified by DELPHI have since been the first areas to report variants of concern (e.g., Omicron in South Africa), and thus DELPHI's choice of these areas also produced early data on how the vaccine responds to new threats. Johnson & Johnson has also implemented a similar approach across its business including supporting trial site selection for other vaccine programs, modeling surgical procedure demand for its Medical Device unit, and providing guidance on return-to-work programs for its 130,000 employees. Continued application of this methodology can help shorten clinical development and change the economics of drug development by reducing the level of risk and cost associated with investing in novel therapies. This will allow Johnson & Johnson and others to enable more effective delivery of medicines to patients.",3,10.1287/inte.2022.1150,"This paper focuses on the application of machine learning (DELPHI) to enhance the efficiency of phase III clinical trials for the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine.

"Purpose The gradual increase in geriatric issues and global imbalance of the ratio between patients and healthcare professionals have created a demand for intelligent systems with the least error-prone diagnosis results to be used by less medically trained persons and save clinical time. This paper aims at investigating the development of image-based colourimetric analysis. The purpose of recognising such tests is to support wider users to begin a colourimetric test to be used at homecare settings, telepathology and so on. Design/methodology/approach The concept of an automatic colourimetric assay detection is delivered by utilising two cases. Training deep learning (DL) models on thousands of images of these tests using transfer learning, this paper (1) classifies the type of the assay and (2) classifies the colourimetric results. Findings This paper demonstrated that the assay type can be recognised using DL techniques with 100% accuracy within a fraction of a second. Some of the advantages of the pre-trained model over the calibration-based approach are robustness, readiness and suitability to deploy for similar applications within a shorter period of time. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first attempt to provide colourimetric assay type classification (CATC) using DL. Humans are capable to learn thousands of visual classifications in their life. Object recognition may be a trivial task for humans, due to photometric and geometric variabilities along with the high degree of intra-class variabilities, it can be a challenging task for machines. However, transforming visual knowledge into machines, as proposed, can support non-experts to better manage their health and reduce some of the burdens on experts.",3,10.1108/JEIM-01-2020-0038,"This paper focuses on developing an intelligent system for colorimetric analysis using deep learning to assist less medically trained individuals in homecare settings.

"Background: Early diagnosis of sepsis has been shown to reduce treatment delays, increase appropriate care, and reduce mortality. The sepsis machine learning algorithm NAVOY (R) Sepsis, based on variables routinely collected at intensive care units (ICUs), has shown excellent predictive properties. However, the economic consequences of forecasting the onset of sepsis are unknown. Objectives: The potential cost and cost-effectiveness impact of a machine learning algorithm forecasting the onset of sepsis was estimated in an ICU setting. Methods: A health economic model has been developed to capture short-term and long-term consequences of sepsis. The model is based on findings from a randomized, prospective clinical evaluation of NAVOY (R) Sepsis and from literature sources. Modeling the relationship between time from sepsis onset to treatment and prevalence of septic shock and in-hospital mortality was of particular interest. The model base case assumes that the time to treatment coincides with the time to detection and that the algorithm predicts sepsis 3 hours prior to onset. Total costs include the costs of the prediction algorithm, days spent at the ICU and hospital ward, and long-term consequences. Costs are estimated for an average patient admitted to the ICU and for the healthcare system. The reference method is sepsis diagnosis in accordance with clinical practice. Results: In Sweden, the total cost per patient amounts to (sic)16 436 and (sic)16 512 for the algorithm and current practice arms, respectively, implying a potential cost saving per patient of (sic)76. The largest cost saving is for the ICU stay, which is reduced by 0.16 days per patient (5860 ICU days for the healthcare sector) resulting in a cost saving of (sic)1009 per ICU patient. Stochastic scenario analysis showed that NAVOY (R) Sepsis was a dominant treatment option in most scenarios and well below an established threshold of (sic)20 000 per quality-adjusted life-year. A 3-hour faster detection implies a reduction in in-hospital mortality, resulting in 356 lives saved per year. Conclusions: A sepsis prediction algorithm such as NAVOY (R) Sepsis reduces the cost per ICU patient and will potentially have a substantial cost-saving and life-saving impact for ICU departments and the healthcare system.",3,10.36469/jheor.2022.33951,"This paper evaluates the economic impact of a machine learning algorithm (NAVOY® Sepsis) for predicting sepsis onset in ICU settings.

"PurposeThis paper aims to contribute to the discussion of the following questions: How can the digital transition improve the management of the operation and maintenance of infrastructure in health-care facilities? What is the legacy for facility management (FM) teams in this post-COVID-19 management of hospital buildings? Design/methodology/approachBased on a literature review, this paper analyses and categorises existing research on the digital challenges for FM from 2011 until 2021 by conducting a qualitative and quantitative method of bibliometric analysis and discussing the status of digital transition impact on FM of the hospital buildings. FindingsThe trends and challenges of building information modelling, artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things identified and discussed in this paper aim to be as comprehensive as possible to grasp the situation of digital transition in the FM industry in the hospital buildings context. Regarding digital maturity, the limited number of publications highlights that control and management systems cannot fully manage the entire operational phase of hospital buildings. Giving intelligence to buildings will undoubtedly be the future. So making buildings reactive, interactive and immersive is an inevitable transformation for intelligent hospital building systems.

"Medicare does not pay for a skilled nursing facility (SNF) unless a fee-for-service patient has stayed in the hospital for at least three days. This Medicare reimbursement rule, or the ""three-day rule,"" provides full coverage for the first 20 days and partial coverage for days 21-100 for skilled nursing care provided at any Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services-approved SNF. In this paper, we study how this Medicare reimbursement rule affects patient routing to SNFs and whether an SNF discharge reduces patients' 30-day hospital readmission rates. Data analysis shows that Medicare patients are more likely to be discharged to an SNF rather than home after the three-day cutoff, and SNF discharges increase hospital readmission rates for Medicare day 3 patients. This perverse effect is driven by infection-related readmissions and is more likely to occur when local SNFs have lower occupancy rates and higher deficiency citations than the median SNF of the same state-year. Back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that the three-day rule may have generated an extra Medicare cost of $71 million to $345 million per year due to the overuse of SNFs and the subsequent rise in hospital readmissions. Replacing the three-day rule with a machine-learning algorithm mimicking private insurers would help.",3,10.1287/mnsc.2022.4316,"This paper investigates the impact of Medicare's ""three-day rule"" on patient routing to skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) and subsequent hospital readmission rates.
