"Fostering innovation is one of the key roles of the Circular Economy (CE) that applies also to European Union (EU) firms, because entrepreneurs are persistently seeking new ways and means to create values, contributing with significant market opportunities, and depicting large potential for EU sustainable growth. This study explores the effects of firms’ investments in using highly disruptive technologies in the energy sector on the Eurozone (EU-27) in the last two decades (1990–2019). An Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) experiment through a Deep Learning (DL) approach is implemented to test this hypothesis. The empirical findings show that investments in highly disruptive technologies, especially by large digitally qualified companies, boost economic growth. They are also a crucial driver of digitalization not only because they enhance a wide strategic change implying a radical innovation in business models, but they completely transform markets, from energy to food production, water resources, pollution, connectivity, and plastic waste. These expected benefits represent a possible policy measure to offset the decline in global activity due to the impact of the Russia-Ukraine war on global energy markets. In addition, a positive association between trade and output is confirmed. Finally, promising policy actions are discussed. © 2024",-1,10.1016/j.jeca.2024.e00372,"This study examines the effects of investments in disruptive technologies on economic growth in the Eurozone, utilizing an Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) approach.

"This paper examines and finds that the answer is likely to be no. The environment examined starts with users who contribute based on their motives to create a public good. Their own actions determine the quality of that public good but also embed a free-rider problem. When AI is trained on that data, it can generate similar contributions to the public good. It is shown that this increases the incentive of human users to provide contributions that are more costly to supply. Thus, the overall quality of contributions from both AI and humans rises compared to human-only contributions. In situations where platform providers want to generate more contributions using explicit incentives, the rate of return on such incentives is shown to be lower in this environment. © 2024 The Author(s)",-1,10.1016/j.econlet.2024.111868,"This paper explores the interaction between AI-generated contributions and human contributions to a public good, focusing on the free-rider problem.

"In strategic and radical innovation, the degree of uncertainty and the amount of complexity is much higher compared to ‘business as usual’. Therefore, idea management systems are often used to support such innovation processes. An interesting question is what we can learn from studying data in such idea management systems and what potential implications we can derive from the innovation management literature. In this study, we were allowed to access and analyze data from the same idea management system used in 11 radical innovation projects from the years 2012–2018. Our analysis unravels 8 findings that in different ways nuance or challenge current research on innovation management. Finally, we discuss how the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in idea management systems can support innovation team members in increasing the innovation potential of the ideas that are elaborated. © 2024, The Author(s).",-1,10.1186/s13731-024-00368-6,This paper analyzes data from idea management systems used in radical innovation projects to derive insights for innovation management literature.

"Artificial intelligence (AI) technology has significantly transformed corporate behavior in the energy sector by enhancing the capacity and efficiency of information transmission and big data analysis. However, there is still a limited understanding of how AI influences new market entry mode strategies in overseas energy investments. Drawing on information processing theory, we propose that firms with advanced AI technology exhibit superior data processing capabilities, which can help energy companies mitigate the uncertainties associated with entering a foreign market and encourage them to choose a wholly-owned entry mode. We further hypothesize that the state ownership of firms, the political affinity between home and host countries, and the risk preferences of firm executives serve as moderating factors. Using a sample of Chinese-listed multinational firms in the energy sector from 2010 to 2021, our empirical results strongly support these predictions.

"This study examines how foreign equity participation affects the risk-taking of commercial banks using Chinese bank-level data from 2012 to 2020. The results indicate that foreign equity participation significantly reduces bank risk, and there is a U-shaped relationship between the foreign shareholding ratio and bank risk. Mechanism analysis reveals that augmenting foreign ownership strengthens shareholder equilibrium and boosts the presence of foreign directors. This structure enhances dual governance mechanisms, lowering the risk in banking activities. Considering that confounding factors affecting mediator and dependent variables can cause bias in coefficient estimation, we used machine learning methods to determine the best predictive factors affecting bank risk-taking. We indirectly verified the theoretically driven empirical model by evaluating more explanatory variables and selecting subsets of explanatory variables. In addition, we find that governance enhancements are particularly pronounced in Chinese banks, characterized by smaller scale and less income diversification. Additionally, foreign ownership significantly impacts banks' market risk more than credit and operational risks. Our results imply that China's financial regulatory authorities need to shift the focus of supervision to examining foreign shareholding ratio and corporate governance ability. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",-1,10.1016/j.pacfin.2024.102387,"This study analyzes the effect of foreign equity participation on the risk-taking behavior of commercial banks in China, utilizing machine learning methods to identify predictive factors.

"Financial institutions have recognized the value of collaborating human expertise and AI to create high-performance augmented decision-support systems. Stakeholders at lending firms have increasingly acknowledged that plugging data into AI algorithms and eliminating the role of human underwriters by automation, with the expectation of immediate returns on investment from business process automation, is a flawed strategy. This research emphasizes the necessity of auditing the consistency of decisions (or professional judgment) made by human underwriters and monitoring the ability of data to capture the lending policies of a firm to lay a strong foundation for a legitimate system before investing millions in AI projects.

"This empirical study investigates whether a strong bank culture may help strengthen, weaken, or have no effect on the relationship between regulatory capital and liquidity creation. Using a machine learning approach and banks’ 10-K reports, we first measure the corporate culture of selected bank holding companies (BHCs) in the United State (U.S.) over the period between 1995 and 2019. We find that bank culture does affect the link between regulatory capital and liquidity creation. In particular, while we find that regulatory capital has a negative impact on bank liquidity creation, a strong culture in a bank weakens this negative association. We also find that an increase in asset-side liquidity creation is the main channel through which bank culture exerts its moderating role. Finally, our results are largely driven by smaller banks, banks with a more traditional funding structure and more profitable banks.

On the other hand, board member age diversity and board member education diversity play a trivial role on cross-border M&A performance. We further introduce an optimization model called Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), which is an artificial intelligence technical application, to address the optimal board diversity regarding the M&A performance. We demonstrate that a better organized board structure, such as increasing female board presentation tend to improve cross-border M&A performance of Chinese firms. We argue that the enhanced performance from optimized board diversity might be transmitted through the channel of corporate governance. Furthermore, we reveal that the board diversity effect is stronger in private owned companies compared with state owned companies. Our results can thereby deliver implications of corporate governance. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.",-1,10.1016/j.iref.2024.02.077,"This paper examines the relationship between board demographic characteristics, particularly gender diversity, and the performance of cross-border M&A in Chinese firms.

"A retention strategy based on an enlightened lapse model is a powerful profitability lever for a life insurer. Some machine learning models are excellent at predicting lapse, but from the insurer’s perspective, predicting which policyholder is likely to lapse is not enough to design a retention strategy. In our paper, we define a lapse management framework with an appropriate validation metric based on Customer Lifetime Value and profitability. We include the risk of death in the study through competing risks considerations in parametric and tree-based models and show that further individualization of the existing approaches leads to increased performance. We show that survival tree-based models outperform parametric approaches and that the actuarial literature can significantly benefit from them.

"This paper shows that higher information technology (IT) adoption by banks was associated to a larger increase in corporate lending in the months following the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy. Examining banks with heterogeneous degrees of IT adoption, we investigate the dynamics of credit and its allocation across firms using a new database with detailed information on banks’ IT expenditures and use of innovative technologies matched with bank-firm level data on credit growth before and during the pandemic. Using a diff-in-diff approach, we find that banks with a higher share of IT spending increased their credit more than others during the pandemic. The increase was concentrated in term loans extended to smaller and financially sounder companies; the effect was stronger in the initial phase of tighter restrictions to firm activity and individual mobility, and more significant for undertakings active in the sectors most affected by the shock. We provide evidence that these results are driven by bank's ability to offer credit entirely online and bank's use of artificial intelligence for credit risk assessment.

"In 2022, global startup investments exceeded US$445 billion, sourced from entities like venture capital (VC) funds, angel investors, and equity crowdfunding. Despite their role in driving innovation, startup investments often fall short of S&P 500 returns. Surprisingly, the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) remains untapped by investors, despite AI's growing sway in financial decision-making. Our empirical analysis predicts the success of 10,000 Israeli startups, utilizing diverse machine learning models. Unlike prior research, we employ the MetaCost algorithm to convert models into cost-sensitive variants, minimizing total cost instead of total error. This innovative approach enables varied costs linked to different prediction errors. Our results underscore that these cost-sensitive machine learning models significantly reduce risk for VC funds and startup investors compared to traditional ones. Furthermore, these models provide investors with a distinct capability to tailor their risk profiles, aligning predictions with their risk appetite. However, while cost-sensitive machine learning reduces risk, it may limit potential gains by predicting fewer successful startups. To address this, we propose methods to enhance successful startup identification, including aggregating outcomes from multiple MetaCost models, particularly advantageous for smaller deal flows.

"The dilemma of how to effectively decumulate retirement savings poses a critical question: Can retirees withdraw 4% of their retirement wealth each year? This study delves into this inquiry, leveraging Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate six decumulation strategies. Unlike conventional studies that assume normal distributions for stock and bond returns, the authors utilize a machine learning algorithm to identify the most suitable distributions. Their results reveal that a static 4% withdrawal rate adjusting for inflation from the initial portfolio may heighten the risk of retirees depleting their savings prematurely. Instead, the authors advocate a sustainable approach: retirees should align annual withdrawals with the remaining portfolio value, accommodating market changes. Considering the delicate balance of securing long-term financial well-being while preventing early fund depletion, the authors identify two superior strategies: adhering to either age-based withdrawal percentages from the Internal Revenue Service's Required Minimum Distribution tables or to the fixed 6% rate, adjusted for inflation, both tied to the remaining portfolio value. © 2024 Portfolio Management Research.

"The article is devoted to issues of controlling the operational risks of a credit institution associated with the actions of personnel. Operational risk control is an important aspect of a credit institution’s business. Despite the fact that the Bank of Russia in regulatory documents described in detail the set of actions that banks should take to control operational risks, in practice credit institutions experience serious difficulties in dealing with operational risk associated with the actions of personnel. This may be explained, first, by the difficulty of identifying and formalizing the specified risk. One of the main sources of operational risks associated with personnel actions is employees’ lack of qualifications. This can lead to reduced availability and quality of services provided by credit institutions, as well as possible financial and reputational losses.

"Employment interruptions of mothers are still one of the main causes for different labour market outcomes between women and men. Employment subsidies can incentivise mothers to shorten employment interruptions after childbirth. We examine a German parental leave reform incentivising an early return to part-time work. Exploiting the exogenous variation defined by the child's birthday, we apply unconditional difference-in-differences (DiD) estimation using administrative data. Machine learning augmented DiD estimation shows that our findings are robust to the inclusion of a large dictionary of potential covariates. Additionally, we estimate conditional effects in the DiD setting. Our results show that being eligible to the new regime yields positive average employment effects that are mainly driven by part-time employment. In particular, the increased attractiveness of part-time work does not cannibalise full-time employment. The policy creates heterogeneous incentives depending on the opportunity costs of working part time: especially mothers with middle income and prior part-time workers respond to the reform. Besides, diverging results for East and West Germany hint at the potential of a change in social norms. © 2024 The Author(s).

"Purpose: This paper investigates the relationship between managerial sentiment and corporate investment in emerging capital markets. Further, we begin with the assertion that the positive impact of managerial sentiment on corporate investment varies according to the corporate life cycle. Lastly, we investigate whether the relationship between managerial sentiment and corporate investment can be moderated by factors like (1) economic policy uncertainty/geo-political risk, (2) size of the firm, (3) financial constraint, (4) industrial competition, and (5) Environmental Social and Governance (ESG) rating. Design/methodology/approach: This study has considered Indian listed companies (465 firms) for the period spanning from 2003–2004 to 2022–2023. This study constructs the managerial sentiment using a novel large language model-financial bidirectional encoder representation from the Transformers (FinBERT), as well as on management discussion and analysis reports. Then, we employ fixed effect regression to investigate the relationship between managerial sentiment and corporate investment. Additionally, we use propensity score matching, two-stage least squares instrumental variables, and a two-step system generalized method of moments approach for robustness tests.

"Discrimination and fairness are major concerns in algorithmic models. This is particularly true in insurance, where protected policyholder attributes are not allowed to be used for insurance pricing. Simply disregarding protected policyholder attributes is not an appropriate solution as this still allows for the possibility of inferring protected attributes from non-protected covariates, leading to the phenomenon of proxy discrimination. Although proxy discrimination is qualitatively different from the group fairness concepts discussed in the machine learning and actuarial literature, group fairness criteria have been proposed to control the impact of protected attributes on the calculation of insurance prices. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the relationship between direct and proxy discrimination in insurance and the most popular group fairness axioms. We provide a technical definition of proxy discrimination and derive incompatibility results, showing that avoiding proxy discrimination does not imply satisfying group fairness and vice versa. This shows that the two concepts are materially different. Furthermore, we discuss input data pre-processing and model post-processing methods that achieve group fairness in the sense of demographic parity. As these methods induce transformations that explicitly depend on policyholders' protected attributes, it becomes ambiguous whether direct and proxy discrimination is, in fact, avoided. © 2024 The Author(s).

"Information technology, as an important tool for realizing the modernization of national governance system and capacity, has brought new opportunities for improving the government’s capacity to deliver basic public services (BPS). Taking the information benefiting people pilot policy as an exogenous shock, we use the double machine learning model to examine the impact of government digitization on urban–rural BPS equalization based on panel data of prefectural cities in China from 2006 to 2021, which overcomes the limitations of the linear setting of traditional causal inference models and maintains estimation accuracy under high-dimensional control variables. The findings suggest that government digitization can significantly contribute to urban–rural BPS equalization, and this conclusion holds after a series of robustness tests. Mechanism test reveals that government digitization promotes urban–rural BPS equalization by improving the efficiency of BPS supply and the efficiency of fiscal transfer payment. Moreover, for cities with low fiscal pressure, high fiscal transparency and low economic growth pressure, government digitization will have a stronger driving effect on urban–rural BPS equalization.

"Since robots came into the world, robotics innovation have steadily increased in China. Nevertheless, whether the development of robotics can aggravate regional economic inequality still requires further analysis. The purpose of this paper is to clarify whether this side effect exists. This paper makes estimations based on city and district/county levels combining the regional economic data and robot patent data. At the city level, we calculate various indicators of city-level regional inequality (such as Gini coefficient and the Theil entropy index) for 282 Chinese cities. At the district/county level, we construct multiple equations to explore the economic roots of above rising inequality. There are many findings. Overall regional inequality is higher in cities with a high degree of robotics development, which is mainly due to agglomeration effects and differentiation effects of robotics. Agglomeration effects are that robotics can boost regional consumption, investment, income, and public services, which constitutes the engine of district/county economic growth. However, the unbalanced innovations of robotics in the urban and rural areas, the economically developed and undeveloped areas, and the population inflow and outflow areas further widen regional development disparities, as strengthened differentiation effects constitute some of the main causes of rising regional inequality. To the best of the author’s knowledge, this paper is the first to analyze the impact of robotics on the regional economic inequality. This empirical study will enrich the existing theoretical perspectives on regional development in the age of artificial intelligence.

"Advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology have led to the strengthening of traditional systems’ cybersecurity capabilities in a variety of applications. However, these embedded machine learning models have exposed these systems to a new set of vulnerabilities known as AI assaults. These systems are now attractive targets for cyberattacks, jeopardizing the security and safety of bigger systems that include them. As a result, DL approaches are critical to transitioning network and system protection from providing safe communication between systems to intelligence systems in security. Federated learning (FL) is a new kind of AI based on heterogeneous datasets and decentralized training. FL is a unique research topic that is currently in its early phases. It has not yet gained wide acceptance in the community, owing mostly to privacy and security considerations. In this research, we first shed light on its privacy and security risks that must be discovered, analyzed, and recorded. FL is favored in scenarios where privacy and security are paramount issues. An extensive understanding of risk factors allows an FL adopter and implementer to construct a safe environment successfully while giving researchers a clear perspective of possible study domains. The survey in this paper intends to include an analysis of cybersecurity and DL approaches and modern advances to improve enhanced protection methods. It proposes a complete examination of FL’s security and privacy issues to assist in bridging the gap between the current level of federated AI and a future in which broad adoption is achievable.

"Can artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms help policymakers in their decisions on inclusive growth? In this study, we introduce artificial intelligence algorithms to calibrate China's inclusive growth determinants. We uncover various factors that significantly influence inclusive growth using machine learning forecasts. Furthermore, our results using best practice methods outperform findings from traditional regression-based strategies on other dimensions, which miss non-linear interactions in their estimations. However, we observe that when the actual value of the inclusive growth index is too large, the accuracy of the machine learning model is diminished. Meanwhile, the results of heterogeneity analysis reveal that the determinants of inclusive growth in cities with different region and different marketization level are distinct. In addition, we adopt the scenario simulation and prediction approach to reveal the best policy measure to promote inclusive growth in China.

"Although artificial intelligence (AI) technology has been widely used in the insurance industry at a global scale, studies examining the adoption of AI technology in emerging markets are few and far between. This paper fills this gap by using Cronbach’s alpha, exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and structural equation model (SEM) to discover significant factors affecting their behavioral intentions to adopt AI technology in Vietnam, a developing country. Data is collected from nearly 470 employees in Vietnamese non-life insurance firms. Empirical findings show that the most important determinant influencing the adoption of AI technology in Vietnamese non-life insurers is attitudes toward adoption. Attitudes toward adoption are positively related to the perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness, consistent with Gupta et al. (2022).

"Accounting research examines accountability in the healthcare field but little attention is paid to how contemporary regulatory innovations (e.g. AI-driven data algorithms) impact accountability objectives. We address this concern through a study of how regulatory innovations may appropriate accountability by (de)legitimising healthcare actions. This is examined in the case of a regulatory innovation enacted in the US healthcare sector. Specifically, we employ a field study of a healthcare provider subject to oversight to highlight how actors (de)legitimise the provision of healthcare services. Our findings show that regulatory innovation generates debates around illegitimate services as determined by healthcare oversight contractors. These contractors are incentivised to appropriate AI-driven data algorithms towards a focus on reducing costs of non-standard healthcare services while healthcare providers legitimate those services as quality healthcare. Additionally, findings suggest that more extensive implementation of AI-driven data algorithms in the healthcare field may serve to limit healthcare options, particularly when combined with private contracting.

"It is interesting to observe that artificial intelligence is gaining popularity in both developing and developed countries as it attracted the interest of accounting, business, and management professionals. This necessitates the need to scrutinise the interaction between artificial intelligence and money laundering. There is an ongoing debate concerning the justifications of artificial intelligence in dealing with money laundering. In this regard, the Southern Africa region is no exception to money laundering just like any other region. As such, the application of artificial intelligence appears to be a rational strategy to curb financial leakages in the finance sector. Although there is an increase in the adoption of artificial intelligence, scanty is known concerning the association between the application of artificial intelligence and money laundering, especially in the Southern Africa region. In this respect, this research aims to provide the effects of artificial intelligence on money laundering in the Southern African region. The study adopted the structured literature review methodology and then six positive effects were observed. These are detecting money laundering activities, enhancing legal compliance, augmenting customer behavioural analytics, detecting money laundering networks, robust financial crime risk computation, and informing evidence-based policy formulation. However, the negative effects are in the form of infringing customer privacy rights, and poor data governance. Despite the existence of few negative effects, it is concluded that artificial intelligence helps to combat money laundering in the Southern African region.

"Climate change is causing issues in all areas of the economy, and robotic and artificial intelligence development have the potential to prevent these risks. We investigate quantile spillovers using quantile vector autoregression (QVAR), robotics, artificial intelligence development, and carbon risk. Using global data on a global daily dataset from carbon emission future (CEF), Global X Robotics & artificial intelligence (BOTZ), iShares Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Multisector (IRBO), First Trust Nasdaq Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (ROBT) from April 1, 2019, to October 28, 2022, our study illustrates that there exists considerable dynamic connectedness between robotic, artificial intelligence development, and carbon risk. The COVID-19 epidemic and the Russia–Ukraine war caused a brief change in direct connectivity over quantiles. CEF consistently receives shocks from the system, while IRBO and ROBT transmit significant shocks to systems. The dynamic net pairwise directional connectivity in the context of quantiles demonstrates that the common eigen factor (CEF) mainly absorbs the influences of the three other variables, especially during COVID-19. This dynamic net pairwise directional connectivity across quantiles demonstrates how unknown events, such as the Ukraine–Russia conflict and the COVID-19 epidemic, affect investor mood as well as both environmentally unfriendly and environmentally beneficial cryptocurrencies.

"A new generation of heterogeneous financing tools is designed to support responsible firms to develop sustainable projects. Also, carbon pricing as the most convenient environmental factor could help eco-friendly assets by creating a more environmentally friendly environment while altering the cost competitiveness of various industries. This paper compared the intrinsic nonlinear associations of carbon emission future price and green bonds (consisting of rigorously screened and green-labeled), with conventional sovereign bonds (in two versions of emerging and developed) and Islamic bonds (including normal and high-quality types). Applying an Elman neural network evaluation to the pairwise connectedness of each bond and carbon market during the period of 12/31/2012 to 8/4/2023, we found that with the exception of emerging sovereign bonds which are tightly related to the carbon market, both green-labeled and extra-financial eligible green bonds have more robust innate nonlinear linkages with the carbon market than developed conventional sovereign bonds and both Islamic versions. Moreover, the results show that extra-financial screening is more effective than the green-labeling process for create a more trustworthy affiliation with the carbon future market.

"This paper contributes to the understanding of the relationship between the nature of data and the artificial intelligence (AI) technological trajectories, on the one hand, and on the dynamic processes triggered by demand during the evolution of an industry, on the other hand. We develop an agent-based model in which firms are data producers that compete on the markets for data and AI. The model is enriched by a public sector that fuels the purchase of data and trains the scientists that will populate firms as workforce. Through several simulation experiments, we analyze the determinants of each market structure, the corresponding relationships with innovation attainments, the pattern followed by labor and data productivity, the quality of data traded in the economy, and in which forms demand does affect innovation and the dynamics of industries. We question the established view in the literature of industrial organization according to which technological imperatives are enough to experience divergent industrial dynamics on both the markets for data and AI blueprints. Although technical change behooves if any industry pattern is to emerge, the actual unfolding is not the outcome of a specific technological trajectory, but the result of the interplay between technology-related factors and the availability of data-complementary inputs such as labor and AI capital, the market size, preferences, and public policies. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",-1,10.1007/s00191-023-00837-3,"This paper develops an agent-based model to explore the interplay between data, AI technological trajectories, and industry dynamics.

The research aims to identify and evaluate the benefits and challenges of AI integration in e-business, explore the ethical concerns related to AI decision-making, and understand the impact of AI on consumer behaviour and preferences. Design/Methodology/Approach: The research adopts a mixed-methods approach, integrating qualitative and quantitative analyses. Primary data was collected via a structured questionnaire distributed among various demographic groups to gauge the level of awareness and experiences with AI in e-business. A range of statistical tests, including ANOVA and correlation tests, were employed to assess the significance of the data collected and to test a set of hypotheses concerning consumer perceptions and experiences of AI. Findings: The results reveal that demographic factors such as age, status, education, and occupation do not significantly impact the level of understanding, awareness, or experiences with AI among Macedonian consumers. Participants exhibited a level of high awareness of the importance of AI in e-business and rated their shopping experiences with AI more positively than traditional methods. Trust and reliability in AI did not significantly differ across demographic lines.

"Using data from Chinese commercial banks from 2008 to 2018, this paper explores the effects of bank FinTech on stability (i.e., bank stability). We first construct and measure a bank Fintech index and then examine the relation between bank FinTech and stability. We argue that bank FinTech affects stability from two aspects: bright effects and dark effects. The results show that the dark effects prevail over bright effects, that is, bank FinTech decreases bank stability. Specifically, a one-standard-deviation increase in bank FinTech is associated with a 14.2 % reduction in bank stability. Our results also show that bank FinTech increases stability by improving risk control and increasing net interest margin (i.e., bright effects), whereas bank FinTech increases non-interest activities, and thus reduces stability (i.e., dark effects). Second, the negative impacts of bank Fintech on stability are weaker in state-owned banks. Third, as time progresses, the negative effects of bank Fintech become weaker. Finally, when we examine five subareas of bank FinTech, we find that artificial intelligence technology and big data technology increase bank stability, but internet technology reduces bank stability.

"Purpose: The economic and administrative conditions of countries normatively have an effect on the economy and level of market development. Moreover, it is of great importance for a healthy economy whether the public institutions and organizations are transparent and functioning in accordance with their purpose. The aim of this study is to show whether there is a relationship between transparency and market efficiency. Design/methodology/approach: Correlation analysis has been conducted between prediction accuracy rates, which are obtained by seven different machine learning algorithms and Corruption Perception Index (CPI) levels. Findings: It has been statistically shown that the indices of countries with low corruption levels are harder to predict, which, in turn, can be interpreted as having higher weak-form market efficiency. According to that, an intermediate negative correlation has been found between CPI scores and predictability levels of stock indices. Considering the findings, it can be interpreted that the markets of countries with relatively more transparent and well-functioning public sector have more weak-form market efficiency. Research limitations/implications: The study can be extended with cutting-edge machine learning and deep learning techniques in future studies. There are very few studies which try to explain factors related to market efficiency. Thus, the authors claim that there is still room for further research in order to determine the factors related to market efficiency, implying that current literature is still far from explaining the causation behind the inefficiencies. Practical implications: According to findings, the markets of countries with relatively more transparent and well-functioning public sector have more weak-form market efficiency.

"We examine the relationship between corporate teamwork culture and firms’ voluntary disclosure, specifically management earnings forecast quality. A new measure of corporate teamwork culture is used, which was calculated using a machine learning approach to analyze earnings call transcripts through a novel word embedding model. We find that firms with stronger corporate teamwork culture are more likely to issue earnings forecasts and file 8-K forms. Further analysis reveals that the corporate teamwork culture score is positively associated with the quality of management earnings forecast. It implies that firms with a stronger teamwork culture issue more accurate earnings forecasts as human harmony cooperation and strong employee responsibility help reduce errors in earnings forecasts.

"Purpose: The paper employs a unique online user-generated housing search dataset and introduces a novel measure for housing demand, namely “contacts per listing” as explained by hedonic, geographic and socioeconomic variables. Design/methodology/approach: The authors explore housing demand by employing an extensive Internet search dataset from a German housing market platform. The authors apply state-of-the-art artificial intelligence, the eXtreme Gradient Boosting, to quantify factors that lead an apartment to be in demand. Findings: The authors compare the results to alternative parametric models and find evidence of the superiority of the nonparametric model. The authors use eXplainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques to show economic meanings and inferences of the results. The results suggest that hedonic, socioeconomic and spatial aspects influence search intensity. The authors further find differences in temporal dynamics and geographical variations.

"We estimate nonmarket values for natural views in an urban setting. These views contain the aesthetics of natural areas commonly found in public parks and open space, and offer an aspect of property valuation that previous research is unable to disentangle from proximity to parks and open space. We incorporate machine learning techniques on Google Street View images to identify natural views in an urban setting. We find positive capitalization rates associated with household views of park-like properties. Estimates are robust to a variety of specifications, including models that are identified off of new developments on neighboring properties and falsification tests that help to rule out the effect of a broader neighborhood environment.

"An unprecedented rate of technological advancement, compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic, has expedited our transition to a fully digitalised society. Tra-ditionally, digital inclusion focuses on an individual’s ability to connect to and access information from the internet. The adoption of novel technologies such as artificial intelligence and blockchain is little distinguished in the literature from internet accessibility. While these digital solutions present novel opportunities, they may also perpetuate or exacerbate the existing hurdles faced by digitally excluded localities. However, these technologies could also be used to tackle the digital divide. Inspired by the design of Bit-coin, the current study offers a conceptual blockchain-based welfare model that adopts a two-pronged approach to enable the fair distribution of capital and resource allocation across the UK regions. The model offers transparency over institutional processes and improves their trustworthiness while preserving privacy. At the community level, the model assumes the application of economic incentives in order to promote digital inclu-sivity and stimulate cooperation and competition within local cultures. By mobilising both public institutions and communities, such a holistic model would assist the flow of information between the supply and demand side of the regional economy.

"Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPACs) are publicly listed “blank check” firms with a sole purpose: to merge with a private company and take it public. Selecting a target to take public via SPACs is a complex affair led by SPAC sponsors who seek to deliver investor value by effectively “picking winners” from the private sector. A key question for all sponsors is what they should be searching for. This paper aims to identify the characteristics of SPACs and their target companies that are relevant to market performance at sponsor lock-up windows. To achieve this goal, the study breaks market performance into a binary classification problem and uses a machine learning approach comprised of decision trees, logistic regression, and LASSO regression to identify features that exhibit a distinct relationship with market performance. The obtained results demonstrate that corporate or private equity backing in target firms greatly improves the odds of market outperformance one-year post-merger. This finding is novel in indicating that characteristics of target firms may also be deterministic of SPAC performance, in addition to SPACs, transaction, and the market features identified in the prior literature. It further suggests that a viable sponsor strategy could be constructed for generating outsized market returns at share lock-up windows by simply “following the money” and choosing target firms with prior involvement from corporate or private equity investors. © 2023 by the author.",-1,10.3390/jrfm16040236,"This paper uses machine learning techniques to analyze the characteristics of SPACs and their target companies that influence market performance.

The starting point for the analysis there is 11,570 anonymized individual values of average gross monthly wage and also personal data of the employees whose wage exceeded the 99th percentile of the sample survey The Informational System on Labour Costs, implemented in the Slovak Republic since 1992 by the company Trexima Bratislava. The aim of the article is to assess the gender pay gap for the best-earning men and women and assess the significance of the impact of selected factors that contribute it. Given the availability of data the monitored factors of the gender pay gap there are education, region of residence, the type of occupation, and the categorized age of employees. To achieve the objective, selected quantitative methods were used, namely methods of descriptive statistics and statistical inference, as goodness-of-fit tests, chi-squared tests of independence and machine learning methods, as normalized Shannon entropy and regression decision tree models. The results of analyses by these methods have been preferably presented in a graphical form. Based on the application of the above methods the significant wage differences by gender at the highest wages (over the 99th percentile of the sample) and significant impact of monitored factors has been confirmed not only on the gender pay gap, but also on the structure of their employment. The results of the analyses lead to the conclusion that the significant wage differences by gender at the highest wages are caused precisely by unequal representation of men and women on the different levels of the monitored factors. © 2022, Technical University of Liberec.

"In the 1920s, innovation, especially assembly line production, led to a new type of corporations and a new form of capitalism that ushered in the age of mass production and mass consumption: Fordism. Digitalisation is again bringing about a radical change in capitalism and the Fordist production structure. Not only has digitalization created an entire new industry, but it is also fundamentally changing the production of classic Fordist industries such as the automotive sector. The Internet of Things, Big Data and artificial intelligence are revolutionising production processes and business models. The more efficient work and production processes generate productivity and welfare gains and promising growth opportunities for the future. However, the flip side of this development is accompanied by an increasingly unequal distribution of these gains. Despite the productivity gains, social inequality is rising in many industrialised countries, increasing the pressured on the welfare and social state through rising debt. This paper provides a theoretical explanation and prediction into how the ongoing digitalisation affects capitalism and what can be expected from this development for the future. The starting point of our consideration is the technological innovation in the course of the digital revolution changes on dominant structure of companies, which is discussed in the first part.

Within the fourth industrial revolution, pursuing digitalization and on the verge of a leap to Industry 5.0 companies and systems all over the world generate a mass of data. These data have to be collected, analyzed, interpreted, and information derived to take the best business decisions to gain the optimized strategy direction. Due to the large amount of data, analysis for business analysts today is only possible to a limited extent. Therefore, companies need support by Cyber-Physical Systems to group the data, enrich the information, and automate decision-making.

"The desirability of a particular tax system depends on how different taxpayers react to it. Exploiting the personal allowance threshold and detailed German tax administration data, this paper examines responses at low taxable incomes to extend previous findings. Taxpayers bunch at the allowance threshold, and more so with non-wage income. Unlike in other studies, wage earners also bunch, at least if they file a tax return, while incomes gross of deductions do not. Deductions account for a sizeable share of the sharp bunching mass of taxpayers with non-wage income. A machine learning analysis identifies which deduction items predict such sharp bunching.

"Insurance companies are witnessing a significant drop in their profit margins particularly in the segment of vehicle insurance due to heavy competition in the industry. Insurance companies are trying to improve their customer base by retaining existing customers and launching new policies with additional benefits. Customers are expecting insurance policies which match to their requirements and at the same time, companies also want to charge more premium for the customers with risky driving behaviour and less for safe driving. Insurance companies are reducing costs with the help of historical risk data and advanced analytics to improve their profits. Insurance companies are capturing real-time vehicle movement data through IoT to monitor the driving behaviour of their customers. By applying advanced analytics on this data, insurance companies can study customers driving pattern to assess the risk involved in it.

"Capitalizing on an innovative measure of corporate culture derived from sophisticated machine learning algorithms and textual analysis, we explore how corporate culture is influenced by one of the most controversial corporate governance mechanisms, i.e., staggered boards. Our findings demonstrate that corporate culture is considerably weakened in the presence of a staggered board, consistent with the notion that staggered boards exacerbate managerial entrenchment and lead to more adverse corporate policies and outcomes. Specifically, corporate culture is approximately 7% weaker, as indicated by a decline in the text-based corporate culture score, in firms with a staggered board than those with a unitary board. Furthermore, we show that the negative effect of staggered boards on corporate culture is significantly more pronounced during more uncertain times.

"Digitalization presents both opportunities and formidable challenges for risk management in commercial banks. This study addresses the critical question of how digitalization influences banks' risk-taking behaviors. Applying an InstructGPT-inspired deep learning model, we developed a multidimensional bank digitalization index to analyze its effects on risk-taking, using data from 149 Chinese commercial banks from 2011 to 2020. The empirical results show that (1) digitalization significantly curtails risk-taking on the balance sheet, while concurrently escalating off-balance sheet risk exposure; (2) digitalization diminishes on-balance sheet risk by lessening distortions in competition due to government guarantees, manifested as a competition effect of on-balance sheet guarantee; (3) digitalization increases the upper limit of expected returns on bank financial products, thereby elevating off-balance sheet risk-taking, evident as an off-balance sheet price competition effect; (4) bank digitalization has a more obvious boosting effect on off-balance sheet risk-taking of banks with a longer average maturiy of wealth management products.

"The unprecedented growth in voice assistants (VAs) provided with artificial intelligence (AI) challenges managers aiming to harness various new technologies to enhance the competitiveness of their products.

Through such matching, VA companies can potentially create a beneficial congruity effect, leading to more favorable evaluations. The results of three studies therefore suggest that users prefer VAs with abstract language in a hedonic-dominant service context, but that VAs with concrete language are more competitive in a utilitarian-dominant service context. Furthermore, the perception of processing fluency mediates this effect.

"Businesses are increasingly using artificial intelligence (AI) in accounting systems to reduce uncertainty and improve accuracy. However, algorithm aversion (Dietvorst et al., 2015) indicates that individuals often avoid information provided by automated systems as compared to that provided by humans. This paper is an exploratory step towards documenting an emotional response to AI. We experimentally investigate how disclosing the use of AI rather than human staff for estimating the fair value of an asset influences investment decisions through lower levels of emotional response, particularly in pleasantness and attentiveness. Consistent with algorithm aversion, we find that disclosing the use of AI to estimate the asset's fair value reduces the effect of information valence on nonprofessional investor responses. Specifically, when a company's AI usage is disclosed, investors make smaller additional investments when fair value information is positive and smaller investment withdrawals when fair value information is negative, as compared to when human staff usage is disclosed. Importantly, we also find that emotions mediate the effect of information source (AI versus human staff) and moderate the effect of information valence on investment decisions. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",-1,10.1016/j.accinf.2023.100664,"This paper experimentally examines how the disclosure of AI usage in accounting affects investment decisions, particularly focusing on emotional responses.

"Bangladesh’s remarkable achievements in economic and social progress have placed the country in a position that was unimaginable just 20 years ago. However, has such improvement in development outcomes been equal across all areas within the country? We aim to address this question by analyzing district-level income per capita derived from the 2000 and 2016 rounds of the Household Income and Expenditure Survey. Using models based on standard neoclassical economic convergence theory, which may also account for natural disasters, we find little evidence of convergence. This suggests that income differentials among Bangladesh’s 64 districts persist. We also examined the possibility of multiple steady states by estimating models with a three-club structure based on income percentiles as registered in 2000. However, we found no evidence of conditional convergence. Additionally, we explored the potential for endogenous club formation using regression trees and machine learning algorithms. Yet, once again, the results did not support convergence. Overall, our findings reveal no evidence of conditional convergence in income among Bangladesh’s districts.

"This paper explores the role of artificial intelligence (AI) within economic institutions, focusing on bounded rationality as understood by Herbert Simon. Artificial Intelligence can do many things in the economy, such as increasing productivity, enhancing innovation, creating new sectors and jobs, and improving living standards. One of the ways that AI can disrupt the economy is by reducing the problem of bounded rationality. AI can help overcome this problem by processing large amounts of data, finding patterns and insights, and making predictions and recommendations. This insight raises the question: can AI overcome planning problems – could it be that central planning is now a viable option for economic organisation? This paper argues that AI does not make central planning viable at either the nation-state level or the firm level, simply because AI cannot resolve the knowledge problem as described by Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek. © The Author(s), 2024.

"In recent years, with the efficient integration of digital technologies such as artificial intelligence and big data with modern financial services, digital finance has gradually played an important role in the export growth of manufacturing enterprises. Studying the impact of digital finance on the export growth of manufacturing enterprises has become an important issue in the current transformation of foreign trade for manufacturing enterprises. This article studies the internal role of digital finance in the growth of enterprise exports from a new perspective of digital finance, aiming to demonstrate the impact of digital finance on the sustainability of Chinese manufacturing enterprise exports. Based on theoretical analysis of the impact of digital finance on enterprise exports, this article uses micro-matching data from the China Industrial Enterprise Database and the Customs Database to empirically test the impact and mechanism of digital finance on enterprise export growth. Empirical research has found that digital finance significantly promotes the growth of enterprise exports, and there is a positive correlation between digital finance and enterprise export growth. This conclusion remains robust after a series of tests. The heterogeneity test shows that digital finance has a more significant role in promoting the export growth of private enterprises and enterprises in the eastern region. Mechanism research shows that digital finance mainly promotes enterprise export growth through mechanisms such as alleviating manufacturing enterprises' financing constraints and enhancing their innovation capabilities, which is consistent with the sustainable development goals.

"Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have significantly attracted the attention of institutional investors over the last decade. However, previous literature has not deeply explored the characteristics of venture capital (VC) investments in AI ventures. In this study, we explore whether and to what extent investments in AI ventures differ from those in similar non-AI ventures, and whether they are moderated by venture-level, country-level, and investor-level factors. We test our hypotheses on a sample of 5235 investments in 2689 AI ventures and 9215 investments in 4373 non-AI ventures belonging to the Industry 4.0 domain, observed from 2000 to 2019. We find that the amount invested in AI ventures is significantly lower than non-AI ones: this negative relationship is, however, moderated by a venture’s development stage, VC investor’s experience and the AI development level of the country in which the invested venture operates. © The Author(s) 2024.",-1,10.1007/s00191-024-00857-7,"This paper examines the characteristics of venture capital investments in AI ventures compared to non-AI ventures, analyzing a large dataset to identify differences and moderating factors.

"This paper demonstrates that mandating narrative disclosure of innovation can help investors better interpret R&D expenditure, a type of intangible investment with outdated accounting treatment. We construct narrative innovation disclosure measures from annual financial reports based on Word2Vec neural network framework.

"The erosion of high-end fashion brands by fast-fashion copycats (e.g., Zara, H&M) has stirred controversies and unceasing legal attempts to copyright fashion designs. Despite the purported negative impact of copycats, the effect of fashion copycats on high-end brands remains empirically unclear. Research on this topic has been impeded by the absence of a modeling framework to quantify fashion and by the lack of consumer-level data on fashion choices. The authors collect data on the posting behaviors of consumers on a fashion-specific social media platform and develop a dynamic structural model with deep learning image analytics to characterize consumers’ choices of brands and styles. Results suggest that fast-fashion copycats can both harm high-end brands (a cannibalization effect) and help them (a market expansion effect). The authors also identify both static and dynamic mechanisms that contribute to the market expansion effect: The affordability of mixing copycats with high-end brands boosts the number of high-end items featured in posts by financially constrained consumers (a static mechanism). In addition, good styles from copycats enable users to build their popularity on social media over time, which may increase the users' valuation of high-end brands and reduce the users' future costs via sponsorship opportunities (dynamic mechanisms). The results could inform policy makers about the potential consequences of prohibiting fashion copycats. © American Marketing Association 2023.",-1,10.1177/00222437231164403,"This paper examines the impact of fast-fashion copycats on high-end fashion brands using consumer data from a social media platform and a dynamic structural model with deep learning analytics.

"Unfavorable external factors such as COVID-19 and economy recession have affected the abilities of enterprises to continue operating. Among them, capital chain resilience has become a key issue for enterprises. In the new era, artificial intelligence (AI) technology can provide new solutions for avoiding the breakage of the capital chain. Using data from listed companies in China, we find that AI technology can improve capital chain resilience. The main impact mechanism is to reduce the level of corporate financial constraints and improve internal control efficiency, and when corporate governance efficiency and resource acquisition capability are lower, such as poor levels of executive supervision and incentive, governance, executive resource acquisition ability, financial statement tone, business and financing environment, the effect of AI technology on improving capital chain resilience is more obvious.

"This paper investigates the economic effects of the opening of the only high-speed rail (HSR) line in northwest China, which connects the northwestern provinces along the Silk Road land route. Northwest China faces two major geographical challenges for economic development: its landlocked location and rugged terrain. To assess the impact of the HSR line on economic activity in counties along this Silk Road land route, we utilise a recently developed machine-learning extended nightlight dataset spanning from 2000 to 2019. For this analysis, we employ the ridge augmented synthetic control method (Ben-Michael et al., 2021). Additionally, we propose an algorithm that automates the donor pool selection process while ensuring optimal pre-treatment comparability. Our findings demonstrate that the opening of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang HSR line resulted in both winners and losers.

"This research supports improved salesforce outcomes for companies with independent sales representatives via the application of emerging technologies. It is framed in expectancy theory (in: Vroom, Work and motivation, Wiley, New York, 1964), Herzberg’s et al. (The motivation to work, Wiley, New York, 1959) two factor theory, and the job demands and resources model (JD-R) (Bakker and Demerouti in J Manag Psychol 22:309–328, 2007). The study analyzes the 2018 National Salesforce Survey (USA) commissioned by the Direct Selling Association (Washington, DC, USA). It identifies key factors in salesforce motivation and performance theories studied within these theoretical frames and channel-specific inputs for direct selling independent representatives. While researchers apply multiple methods to salesforce motivation and performance, the power of machine learning has not been applied to independent representatives and their unique circumstances. This research employs supervised learning algorithms for predictive analytics to create models for recruits and existing independent representatives. It finds that the most crucial factors align with expectancy theory for both. Allocated time for direct selling, ability to find new customers, gender, and adopting direct selling as a career play key roles in predicting sales success for individuals entering direct selling. The highest-performing representatives are characterized by time invested, experience of direct selling, recruitment, tenure, and use of technology. By predicting representative success factors, organizations can tailor recruitment, training, and incentives to maximize performance. Because independent sales representatives are not employees, understanding these factors is critical to firms engaging them.

"Sovereign debt has traditionally been regarded a safe asset class. However, the pic-ture has shifted in the last decade, with a significant increase in the number of sovereign defaults. The drivers of this increase are complex and as yet unexplored, but it is clear that factors other than traditional macroeconomic events are significantly underpinning these economies. Therefore, understanding how the drivers of sovereign credit risk have evolved beyond economic and fiscal issues, as well as the importance of additional drivers in sovereign credit risk assessment, is critical. This paper explains the strength of the effect of spillover effects from private sector risks on sovereign debt risk, as well as the impact of rising sustainability risks on sovereign credit risk and their underlying relationship, using the XGBoost classification algorithm and model interpretability techniques, namely Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) and local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME). First, we dis-cover that private sector risks contribute significantly to sovereign credit risk and that these factors must be considered alongside macroeconomic variables when modeling sovereign credit risk. Further, we find evidence that sustainability risks are financially material to sovereign creditworthiness. The relationship between sustainability risks and sovereign credit risk is complex, follows a nonmonotonic relationship and is highly dependent on country specificities, necessitating the integration of sustain-ability risk factors while accounting for interactions with the economic state of a country. © 2023 Infopro Digital Risk (IP) Limited.",-1,10.21314/JCR.2022.008,"This paper examines the evolving drivers of sovereign credit risk, focusing on the impact of private sector and sustainability risks.

"Economists have often viewed the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) as a standard process innovation where we expect that efficiency will drive adoption in competitive markets. This paper models AI based on recent advances in machine learning that allow firms to engage in better prediction. Focusing on prediction of demand, it is demonstrated that AI adoption is a complement to variable inputs whose levels are altered directly by predictions and whose use is economized by them (that is, labour). It is shown that in a competitive market, this increases the short-run elasticity of supply and may or may not increase average equilibrium prices. Generically, there are externalities in adoption, with this reducing the profits of non-adoptees when variable inputs are important, and increasing them otherwise. Thus AI does not operate as a standard process innovation, and its adoption may confer positive externalities on non-adopting firms. In the long run, AI adoption is shown to lower prices generally and raise consumer surplus in competitive markets. © 2023 The Author.

"A significant amount of research has been conducted regarding the resilience of the regions and the factors that contribute to allow them to face challenges, crises, or disasters. The rise of promising sectors like Machine learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) can enhance this research using computing power in regional economic, social, and environmental data analysis to find patterns and create prediction models. Through Machine Learning, the following research introduces the use of models that can predict the performance of a region in disasters. A case study of the performance of USA Counties during the Covid19 first wave period of the pandemic and the related restrictions that were applied by the authorities was used in order to reveal the obvious or hidden parameters and factors that affected their resilience, in particular their economic response, and other interesting patterns between all the involved attributes. This paper aims to contribute to a methodology and to offer useful guidelines in how regional factors can be translated and processed by data and ML/AI tools and techniques. The proposed models were evaluated on their ability to predict the economic performance of each county and in particular the difference of its unemployment rate between March and June of 2020. The former is based on several economic, social, and environmental data-up to that point in time-using classifiers like neural networks and decision trees. A comparison of the different models' execution was performed, and the best models were further analyzed and presented. Further execution results that identified patterns and connections between regional data and attributes are also presented. The main results of this research are i) a methodological framework of how regional status can be translated into digital models and ii) related examples of predictive models in a real case. An effort was also made to decode the results in terms of regional science to produce useful and meaningful conclusions, thus a decision tree is also presented to demonstrate how these models can be interpreted. Finally, the connection between this work and the strong current trend of regional and urban digitalization towards sustainability is established. © 2023 by the authors.

"Most of the growth forecasts in analysts’ evaluation reports rely on human judgment, which leads to the occurrence of bias. A back-propagation neural network (BPNN) is a financial technique that learns a multi-layer feedforward network.

"I present reduced-form and structural evidence that the reorganization of the Russian economy in the post-transitional period increased the demand on law and business graduates. This demand shock provides a novel unified explanation of the Russian wage structure for 1985–2015. I then show that this shock is a common feature of all transitional economies, and it contributed to the transformational recession. The demand behaviour is identified with a new skill-biased technical change model of demand for skills with three production inputs (high school graduates and bachelor-level educations with two majors), showing that a technology shift that favours a particular skill might emerge within the skilled group rather than between skilled and unskilled. This is relevant because similar shifts (e.g., data scientists vs. liberal arts) emerge today in the frontier economies that adopt new general-purpose technologies (e.g., machine learning). Thus, this paper informs policymakers today on tools to counteract a potential drop in economic equality and performance that result from this adoption. Lastly, because of similarities between the mechanics of the transition and the 2022 sanctions to discourage Russia's war effort, my results highlight the importance of additional sanctions against the education system to prevent the regime's structural adaptation and preservation. © 2022 The Authors.

"Reinsurers possess high volumes of policy listings data from insurers, which they use to provide insurers with analytical insights and modeling that guide reinsurance treaties. These insurers often act on the same data for their own internal modeling and analytics needs. The problem is this data is messy and needs significant preparation in order to extract meaningful insights. Traditionally, this has required intensive manual labor from actuaries. However, a host of modern AI techniques and ML system architectures introduced in the past decade can be applied to the problem of insurance data preparation.

"Does adopting social distancing policies amid a health crisis, e.g., COVID-19, hurt economies? Using a machine learning approach at the intermediate stage, we applied a generalized synthetic control method to answer this question. We utilize state policy response differences. Cross-validation, a machine learning approach, is used to produce the “counterfactual” for adopting states—how they “would have behaved” without lockdown orders. We categorize states with social distancing as the treatment group and those without as the control. We employ the state time-period for fixed effects, adjusting for selection bias and endogeneity. We find significant and intuitively explicable impacts on some states, such as West Virginia, but none at the aggregate level, suggesting that social distancing may not affect the entire economy. Our work implies a resilience index utilizing the magnitude and significance of the social distancing measures to rank the states' resilience.

"The housing market is of tremendous importance to the Chinese economy. Housing prices in a metropolitan like Beijing are determined not only by the structural attributes of housing units, but also by the externality stemming from local amenities and their investment potential. Meanwhile, the traditional hedonic pricing model fails to capture the latter two aspects due to its inability to capture the spatial and temporal dimensions of the housing market. In this paper, we augment the traditional model by introducing machine learning algorithms that can handle the additional complexity arising from time and space. Using a transaction-level dataset of housing prices in Beijing, we compare the performance of random forest and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) with Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and local polynomial. We find that GBM significantly outperforms the other methods in spatial prediction and sequential forecast. GBM’s superior predictive capacity indicates the potential of machine learning techniques in reducing the costs of real estate appraisal, alleviating information asymmetry in the housing market, and improving people’s welfare given the implications of home ownership on economic inequality and social mobility. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",-1,10.1007/s10614-021-10209-3,"This paper enhances the traditional hedonic pricing model for the housing market by incorporating machine learning algorithms to account for spatial and temporal factors.

"In their seminal 2001 work, Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson (AJR) argued that institutions influence economic development, using the logarithm of settler mortality as an instrument to establish a causal effect. A number of economists and other social scientists have challenged this work in terms of both data and identification strategy. Some of those criticisms concerned the IV estimated coefficients and standard errors, which were nearly twice as large as the OLS coefficients and standard errors. The research uses machine learning to test the robustness of AJR’s findings. Using the AJR dataset, which I randomly divide into training data and testing data, I am able to predict the average protection against expropriation risk from settler mortality. These predicted values of property rights protection are then regressed on per capita GDP growth. The results indicate a strong and positive effect of property rights protection on growth, consistent with AJR’s earlier results. Moreover, the use of machine learning to obtain institutional values yields estimates close to the OLS estimates, unlike AJR. Removing African countries and Neo-European countries, such as Canada, Australia, USA, and New Zealand, does not alter the sign and significance of the coefficient of interest.

"This paper studies tenant behavior in rental housing when the landlord pays for heating. I develop a model in which renters have heterogeneous preferences for home size and indoor temperature. When energy is costly, renters choose smaller apartments and turn down the heat—or sort into apartments with landlord-pay energy bills. I estimate the model using exogenous variation in energy prices and use a machine-learning algorithm to explore preference heterogeneity. Surprisingly, I find that renters who prefer hotter temperatures do not systematically choose landlord-pay units, though I am unable to rule out sorting on preferences for unobserved home attributes. Eliminating moral hazard by forcing all renters to pay their own bill reduces energy consumption by 25% due to renters turning down the heat (21%) and choosing smaller units (4%).

"The yield curve is a fundamental input parameter of valuation theories in capital markets. Information about yields can be observed in a discrete form, either directly through traded yield instruments (eg, interest rate swaps) or indirectly through the prices of bonds (eg, government bonds). Capital markets usually create benchmark yield curves for specific and very liquid market instruments, or for issuers where many different quotes of individual yield information for specific maturities are observable. The standard methods to construct a continuous yield curve from discrete observable yield data quotes are the fit of a mathematical model function, interpolation or regression algorithms. This paper expands these standard methods to include artificial intelligence algorithms, which have the advantage of avoiding any assumptions with regard to the mathematical model functions of the yield curve, and which can conceptually adapt easily to any market changes. Nowadays, the most widely used risk-free yield curve in capital markets is the overnight index swap (OIS) curve, which is derived from observable OISs and is used in this paper as the benchmark curve to derive and compare different yield curve fits. © Infopro Digital Limited 2019.

"On the issue of insurance discrimination, a grey area in regulation has resulted from the growing use of big data analytics by insurance companies: direct discrimination is prohibited, but indirect discrimination using proxies or more complex and opaque algorithms is not clearly specified or assessed. This phenomenon has recently attracted the attention of insurance regulators all over the world. Meanwhile, various fairness criteria have been proposed and flourished in the machine learning literature with the rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI) in the past decade and have mostly focused on classification decisions. In this article, we introduce some fairness criteria that are potentially applicable to insurance pricing as a regression problem to the actuarial field, match them with different levels of potential and existing antidiscrimination regulations, and implement them into a series of existing and newly proposed antidiscrimination insurance pricing models, using both generalized linear models (GLMs) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost).

"We study the predictive value of climate risks for subsequent financial stress in a sample of daily data running from October 2006 to December 2022 of thirteen countries, which include China, ten European Union (EU) countries, the United Kingdom (UK), and the United States (US). The climate risk indicators are the result of a text-based approach which combines the term frequency-inverse document frequency and the cosine-similarity techniques. Given the persistence of financial stress as well as the importance of spillover effects of financial stress from other countries, we use random forests, a machine-learning technique tailored to handle many predictors, to estimate our forecasting models. Our findings show that climate risks tend to have a moderate impact, albeit in several cases statistically significant, on predictive accuracy, which tends to be stronger, in our cross-section of countries, on a daily than at a weekly or monthly forecast horizon of financial stress. Furthermore, the predictive value of climate risks for financial stress is heterogeneous across the countries in our sample, implying that a univariate forecasting model appears to be better suited than a corresponding multivariate one.

"In this paper, we propose a flexible machine learning framework to predict customer lifetime value (CLV) in the Business-to-Business (B2B) Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) setting. The substantive and modeling challenges that surface in this context relate to more nuanced customer relationships, highly heterogeneous populations, multiple product offerings, and temporal data constraints. To tackle these issues, we treat the CLV estimation as a lump sum prediction problem across multiple products and develop a hierarchical ensembled CLV model. Lump sum prediction enables the use of a wide range of supervised machine learning techniques, which provide additional flexibility, richer features and exhibit an improvement over more conventional forecasting methods. The hierarchical approach is well suited to constrained temporal data and a customer segment model ensembling strategy is introduced as a hyperparameter model-tuning step. The proposed model framework is implemented on data from a B2B SaaS company and empirical results demonstrate its advantages in tackling a practical CLV prediction problem over simpler heuristics and traditional CLV approaches. Finally, several business applications are described where CLV predictions are employed to optimize marketing spend, ROI, and drive critical managerial insights in this context. © 2023, The Author(s).",-1,10.1057/s41270-023-00234-6,"This paper develops a machine learning framework for predicting customer lifetime value (CLV) in the B2B SaaS context, addressing challenges related to customer relationships and temporal data.

"The traditional literature on fiscal federalism prescribes centralization of redistributive tasks to avoid welfare- or tax-induced migration. More recent work shows that even if the redistributive part of taxation, namely progressivity, is set by an upper-layer government and lower-layer governments only compete via a tax multiplier, income sorting can flatten effective tax progressivity. We argue that upper-layer governments anticipate the impact of local income sorting and strategically adjust their statutory tax schedules. The mobility of the income tax base sets limits to such strategic behavior. We apply causal machine learning methods to identify the effects of decentralization on the statutory tax structure in Switzerland.

"The main focus of this article is the problem of exacerbating agricultural risks in the context of the COVID-19 crisis, which started against the background of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. The motivation for conducting the research presented in this article was the desire to increase the resilience of agricultural companies to economic crises. This paper is aimed at studying the Russian experience of changing the production and financial risks of agricultural companies during the COVID-19 crisis, substantiating the important role of innovations in reducing these risks, and determining the prospects for risk management in agriculture based on innovations to increase its crisis resilience. Using the structural equation modelling (SEM) method, we modelled the contribution of innovations to the risk management of agriculture during the COVID-19 crisis. The advantages of the SEM method, compared to other conventional methods (e.g., independent correlation analysis or independent regression analysis), include the increased depth of analysis, its systemic character, and the consideration of multilateral connections between the indicators. Using the case-study method, a “smart” vertical farm framework is being developed, the risks of which are resistant to crises through the use of datasets and machine learning.

"Our main contribution in this paper consists of analyzing long-run interactions between health status and innovation in the form of R&D activities accounting for possible economic development. For this purpose, we are based on a sample of fifteen developed and fifteen developing countries across the world during the period 2000–2017. As the principal interest is on the long-run effect, it is not essential to be concerned about the variable lags through which innovation will impact health. Therefore, to get the asymptotically efficient long-run impact of innovation on health, we have introduced both dynamic OLS and fully modified OLS for developed countries. Further, we have employed a technique based on panel ARDL methods for developing countries which deals with the stationary series problem of different orders to monitor possible association between population health and innovation in the long-run horizon. Our empirical results support long- and short-run causality running from R&D activities to health in all developed countries, whereas the just-mentioned causality prevails only in the long-run in case of developing countries. Finally, to check the robustness of the said association, we have implemented neural network-based NARX technique to validate the prediction of health status on the basis of R&D activities, and eventually, NARX supports our hypothesis in case of long-run through back-propagation. Policy recommendation includes the encouragement of more R&D activities and R&D-related policy implementation in both developed and developing nations to opt for better health status. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",-1,10.1007/s13132-021-00839-1,"This paper analyzes the long-run interactions between health status and R&D activities across developed and developing countries.

"Purpose: Research and development (R&D) is increasingly considered to be a key driver of economic growth. The relationship between these variables is commonly examined using linear models and thus relies only on single-point estimates. Against this background, this paper provides new evidence on the impact of R&D on economic growth using a machine learning approach that makes it possible to go beyond single-point estimation. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use the kernel regularized least squares (KRLS) approach, a machine learning method designed for tackling econometric models without imposing arbitrary functional forms on the relationship between the outcome variable and the covariates. The KRLS approach learns the functional form from the data and thus yields consistent estimates that are robust to functional form misspecification. It also provides pointwise marginal effects and captures non-linear relationships. The empirical analyses are conducted using a sample of 101 countries over the period 2000–2020. Findings: The estimates indicate that R&D expenditure and high-tech exports positively and significantly influence economic growth in a non-linear manner. The authors also find a positive and statistically significant relationship between economic growth and greenhouse gas emissions. In both cases, the effects are higher for upper-middle-income and high-income countries. These results suggest that a substantial effort is needed to green economic growth. Internet access is found to be an important factor in supporting economic growth, especially in high-income and middle-income countries. Practical implications: This paper contributes to underlining the importance of investing in R&D to support growth and shows that the disparity between countries is driven by the determinants of economic growth (human capital in R&D, high-tech exports, Internet access, economic freedom, unemployment rate and greenhouse gas emissions). Moreover, since the authors find that R&D expenditure and greenhouse gas emissions are positively associated with economic growth, technological progress with green characteristics may be an important pathway for green economic growth.

"How technology affects employment has long been debated. In this regard, the recent debate revolves around the impact of Information and Communication Technology (a form of new technology) on productivity and employment. ICT perceived as GPT (general-purpose technology) like steam engines or electricity in the past ushered the world into a new techno-economic paradigm, i.e., it is hard to imagine an economic activity without using it, directly or indirectly. Eventually, ICT investment as a percentage of non-ICT investment (known as ICT intensity) increased significantly over the years in industries across all sectors. How increased ICT intensity affected employment is exactly the question taken up through the paper. To find the answer, on the basis of ICT intensity, industries belonging to the organized sector are categorized into ICT-producing (ICTPS), ICT-using (ICTUS) and non-ICT-using (NICTUS) sectors, with their further division into the manufacturing and the services sector. Empirically, it is found that only the ICTPS witnessed high employment elasticity (EE) with increased ICT intensity since 2000, something found true in both of its segments manufacturing and services sectors, and in both periods Period I (2000–2005) and Period II (2005–2010). In contrast, in ICTUS, EE declined with increased ICT intensity. The trend was found true in both of its constituents. Finally, within NICTUS, in both periods, in both sectors, employment elasticity increased with ICT intensity. In conclusion, for the country as a whole, EE has increased, driven by the services sector, with increased ICT intensity. So, it can be ascertained that new technology in the form of ICT has resulted in a positive employment impact in the services sector, but not in the secondary sectors. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Indian Society of Labour Economics.",-1,10.1007/s41027-022-00370-0,"This paper examines the impact of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) intensity on employment across different sectors.

This article aims to capture, in an original way, how the translation of a great part of the world and social life into cyberspace, especially in the wake of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, relieves the natural environment/climate of Anthropocene pressures (e.g., via optimizations of production processes, favoured by artificial intelligence etc.), or, on the contrary, a less noticeable aspect, how it worsens certain components of it (e.g., via the amplified need for energy or for rare minerals, critical to new technologies etc.). Moreover, the above-mentioned ecological alleviations (labelled as of software nature) and (hardware) aggravations brought by digitalization are duly emphasized and evaluated in the light of the (un)intended consequences occurring at the highly sensitive intersection between markets (private practices) and states (public policies), pointing to the case of the European Union. © 2022, Amfiteatru Economic.

"Customer retention, measured as percentage policies renewed every year (persistency ratio), is one of the most important metrics for any life insurer. Due to several factors, including complexity of life insurance products, gap in understanding the importance of policy renewals and lack of appropriate engagement with the customers, higher lapsation rates for life insurance policies have been observed globally, specifically in India. Typically for a life insurance company, policy renewal premiums drive close to 60–70% revenue and retaining customers for a period of more than 6–7 years is critical to business profitability. Customer retention operations primarily include engaging with customers through telephonic renewal calls or other mediums to pay renewal premiums on time. With close to 70% of total policies present in the premium renewal base, tracking, scheduling, execution of customer retentions calls and campaigns contribute to a major cost head for life insurers. In this paper, the authors present an advanced analytic solution to effectively manage customer retention costs and improve the overall persistency. The paper demonstrates the use of several machine learning and deep learning neural network-based models to classify the customers based on propensity of not paying renewal premiums on time. The study includes a comparative analysis of model performance with the deep learning neural network model showing the highest performance.

"Predicting the success of a new venture has always been a topical issue for both investors and researchers. Nowadays, it has become even more relevant concerning start-ups-young innovative and technology enterprises aimed at scaling their businesses. The purpose of this study is to create a model for predicting start-ups' success based on their descriptive characteristics. A model that connects such start-up features as the period from foundation to the first financing, the area of activity, type, and amount of the first financing round, business model, and applied technologies, with the start-up investment success, which refers to re-investment, has been developed using data from the Dealroom platform on statistics of start-ups activity and their description. The final sample included 123 start-ups that are founded or operate in Ukraine. Three machine learning algorithms are compared: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. Acceptable results were obtained in terms of Accuracy, Sensitivity, and F-score, despite the limited data. The best model concerning start-up success prediction is determined by a Decision Tree, with an average effectiveness of 61%, 55%, and 52%, respectively. The AUC level for the Decision Tree achieved 58%, which is lower than the Logistic Regression and Random Forest scores (65%). But the last models had done so well by better predicting start-up failures, while more practical is the ability to predict their success. All models showed an acceptable level of AUC to confirm with confidence their effectiveness. The decision support system for the investment object can be helpful for entrepreneurs, venture analysts, or politicians who can use the built models to predict the success of a start-up.

"Purpose: The boom in live streaming has intensified competition among streamers for viewers' gifts, which makes it meaningful to study the factors that affect the viewers’ gifting behavior. Given the emotional attachment between streamers and viewers, the authors set out to elucidate a new driver on viewer gifting: expressions of the streamer. This research aims to explore the impact of streamer emotions on the viewer gifting behaviors, including free and paid gifting. The loyalty level of the viewers is also introduced as a moderating factor to investigate the heterogeneous effect of streamer emotions on gifting behavior. Design/methodology/approach: The dataset the authors collected consists of two parts, including 1809.69 h of live streaming videos and 358,002 gift giving records. Combined with deep learning methods and regression analysis, the authors performed empirical tests on the 81,110 valid samples. Several robustness checks were also conducted to ensure the reliability of main results. Findings: The empirical results show that streamer emotions do have effects on viewers' free and paid gifting behavior. The authors’ findings show that positive streamer expressions, such as happiness and surprise, have a positive influence on viewer gifting behavior. However, some negative expressions, like sadness, can also have a positive impact. Moreover, the authors discovered that higher viewer loyalty amplifies the positive effect of streamer emotions and reduces the negative effect. Originality/value: This research contributes to the study about streamer emotions and viewers' consumption behavior, which extends the application of emotion as social information model (EASI model) in the live streaming setting.

"We examine extreme connectedness between the artificial intelligence (AI) tokens, artificial intelligence ETFs, and other asset classes, using the quantile VAR approach of Ando et al., (2022). We find moderate connectedness levels at mean and median quantiles, with AI ETFs (AI tokens) acting as strong (weak) net emitters (receivers) of return spillovers. Findings, confirmed by alternative testing, suggest that, during normal market conditions, AI tokens may offer utility as diversifiers for portfolios of traditional assets. However, at both lower and upper quantiles, connectedness levels increase, consistent with AI tokens and ETFs being sensitive to extreme shocks. Results suggest that AI tokens and ETFs do not diversify the risk of other assets during extreme market conditions.

"As the application of artificial intelligence (AI) becomes more prevalent, it has attracted the attention of high-tech firms, which adopt AI applications in response to emerging societal, technological, and environmental challenges. In the AI application processes, big data analytical capacity has become increasingly important. Although AI may potentially revolutionise the markets, industries, and general business activities, the question remains how high-tech firms can implement AI in their operations effectively and efficiently, so as to enhance their operational performances. This study aims to explore whether high-tech firm employees’ intention to adopt AI applications and the firms’ big data analytical capability would affect the operational performance. Besides utilising the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology as a framework, this study also adopted the structural equation modelling (SEM) and related statistical analyses (using SPSS and LISREL).

"This paper examines the venture capital-driven process of making intangible assets in platform start-up firms. By examining the case study of the rise and fall of a venture capital-backed ‘unicorn’ firm developing a digital health platform, this paper argues that the process of real valorization of capital invested in platform start-up firms involves the making of algorithmic systems and data as intangible assets as well as the experimentation with strategies of exploitation and appropriation, which are inherently linked to the future-oriented financial valorization process of equity shares since unprofitable start-up firms continuously require outside capital to expand operations. While the fetish of ‘artificial intelligence’ posing the firm’s chatbot for self-diagnosis as an intelligent ‘doctor in your pocket’ plays an important role in financial valorization, it is the failed real valorization process in making profits that ultimately leads to the platform start-up’s financial collapse.

"We examine how education expansions affect the job opportunities for workers with and without the new education. To identify causal effects, we exploit a quasi-random establishment of Universities of Applied Sciences (UASs), bachelor-granting three-year colleges that teach and conduct applied research. By applying machine-learning methods to job advertisement data, we analyze job content before and after the education expansion. We find that, in regions with the newly established UASs, not only job descriptions of the new UAS graduates but also job descriptions of workers without this degree (i.e., middle-skilled workers with vocational training) contain more high-skill job content. This upskilling in job content is driven by an increase in high-skill R&D-related tasks and linked to employment and wage gains. The task spillovers likely occur because UAS graduates with applied research skills build a bridge between middle-skilled workers and traditional university graduates, facilitating the integration of the former into R&D-related tasks. © 2023",-1,10.1016/j.labeco.2023.102354,"This paper examines the causal effects of education expansions on job opportunities using a quasi-random establishment of Universities of Applied Sciences.

"This study analyses the dynamic impact of income inequality and unemployment on crime in a panel of 15 African countries during the period 1994–2019 using four models: the panel vector autoregression model, the generalized method of moments model, the fixed-effect model, and machine learning. These models were chosen due to their ability to address the dynamics of several entities. The variables employed for empirical investigation include income inequality, unemployment, and crime. Machine learning was adopted to find which socioeconomic issues contribute to crime between the two issues at hand. The results show that income inequality accounts for 64% of crime, making it the biggest contributor to crime. The findings further show that an unexpected shock in inequality and unemployment has a significant positive impact on crime in these countries. Even when pre-tax income held by the top 10% and male unemployment is adopted, the study yields similar results. Educational entertainment through secondary enrolment was found to increase crime, while it was found to decrease crime through tertiary enrolment at the tertiary level. Finally, economic development was found to decrease crime. From a policy perspective, the current study suggests to the government that some policies are more appropriate for addressing concerns about income inequality and unemployment (income policy or fiscal policy). Therefore, more policies targeting the distribution of income are crucial, as that might decrease income inequality while at the same time decreasing crime.

Second, the findings show that there was an inverted-U relationship between economic growth and inequality. This explains apparent contradictions in research findings in the literature. Third, the optimal level of inequality, which corresponds to the highest level of economic growth, is computed for different economies. Our findings were confirmed by the development processes in many developing countries and also in China in recent years, thereby highlighting the importance of inequality alleviation in promoting further economic growth. These findings enable us to derive pragmatic policy implications for other developing countries at different stages of economic development in achieving sustainable growth with equity. © 2022 Institute of World Economics and Politics, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.",-1,10.1111/cwe.12435,"This study uses an artificial neural network approach to analyze the relationship between economic growth and inequality.

"The last decade has seen the rapid development of digital information technology, the intellectualization of control systems, the increase in the number and capacity of mobile and computer devices, and the accumulation of large amounts of data and its processing through machine learning algorithms, which inevitably leads to new opportunities for economic development. Rapid digitalization and its penetration into various spheres of public life contributed to increasing the level of transparency of public administration, strengthening public control, and reducing the bureaucratization of society. Hence, digital technologies can serve as tools to fight corruption and create conditions for intensive economic growth. Therefore, the topic based on the study of transmission effects in the chain ""corruption-digitization-economic growth"" is relevant. The work aims to develop methodological tools for assessing the transmission effects between digitalization, corruption level decrease, and economic growth. The following methods were used for the study: Levin-Lin-Chu, Hadri, Pesaran, and Chin tests, Dickey-Fuller tests - to check stationary variables; statistical criterion Kao - to check the existence of cointegration relationship between variables; modified least-squares method - to estimate regression coefficients based on panel data; coefficient of determination and Jarque-Bera test - to verify the adequacy of the econometric model. An empirical study confirmed the hypothesis of the presence of transmission effects between indicators that characterize the level of corruption in the economy, digitalization, and economic growth. It has been proven that the reduction of corruption and the growth of digitalization in studied countries contributes to economic growth. © 2022, Fintech Aliance LLC.

"Today's artificial intelligence, largely based on data-intensive machine learning algorithms, relies heavily on the digital labour of invisibilized and precarized humans-in-the-loop who perform multiple functions of data preparation, verification of results, and even impersonation when algorithms fail. Using original quantitative and qualitative data, the present article shows that these workers are highly educated, engage significant (sometimes advanced) skills in their activity, and earnestly learn alongside machines. However, the loop is one in which human workers are at a disadvantage as they experience systematic misrecognition of the value of their competencies and of their contributions to technology, the economy, and ultimately society.

"How do consumers value conformity, and what are the implications for conservation policy? In this article, we study conformity in homeowners’ landscaping choices—which have important consequences for water consumption—for housing parcels throughout a large arid American city. We use machine learning techniques to generate precise land cover classifications on each parcel from remote sensing imagery, allowing us to obtain hedonic estimates of the marginal value of conformity. Our work is unique as the first to study this behavioral phenomenon using rich observational data from a real-world market. We then overlay these estimates on a theoretical model to characterize how conformity motives interact with conservation. We find that Pigouvian pricing is roughly half as effective in the presence of conformity, as our estimated conformity effects will countervail price effects. This work shows how behavioral phenomena, such as conformity, may have empirically relevant impacts on the effectiveness of standard conservation interventions. © 2021 Agricultural and Applied Economics Association",-1,10.1111/ajae.12224,"This paper examines how homeowners' landscaping choices reflect conformity and its implications for water conservation.

"For Russia, a major producer of natural resources, digitization and implementation of the principles of Industry 4.0 into the sphere of environmental resources management is a strategic task. This will allow preserving and using natural resources effectively, as well as ensuring the ecological well-being of the country. The purpose of this chapter is to identify improvements to the existing mechanism of environmental resources management for implementing the principles of Industry 4.0. Methodology: Тhe theoretical and methodological basis of the research is scientific work by both Russian and foreign scholars on the digitization of the economy, creation of Industry 4.0, rational use of natural resources and environment protection, and sustainable development. A systemic approach was taken using a complex set of methods and methodologies that conform to the research tasks. The main scientific tools are economic analysis, including ecological and economic analysis, and various types of systemic analysis: conceptual content analysis, information modeling, theory of sets, and theory of multidimensional information spaces. Results: It is shown that the formation of the cyber economy, in which all elements of the economic mechanism of environmental resources management interact with the help of information technologies on the basis of AI, requires a corresponding favorable environment. To achieve this, it is proposed that there should be a fundamental modernization of the economic mechanisms for natural resources management to harmonize the normative and legal foundation, add methodological provisions, provide organizational and economic support, and incorporate financial, technological, and social components. It is determined that the process of digitization and implementation of the principles of Industry 4.0 should be aimed at achieving the functioning of the national economic system so that the goals of economic development do not contradict ecological imperatives.

"In applications of predictive modeling, such as insurance pricing, indirect or proxy discrimination is an issue of major concern. Namely, there exists the possibility that protected policyholder characteristics are implicitly inferred from non-protected ones by predictive models and are thus having an undesirable (and possibly illegal) impact on prices. A technical solution to this problem relies on building a best-estimate model using all policyholder characteristics (including protected ones) and then averaging out the protected characteristics for calculating individual prices. However, such an approach requires full knowledge of policyholders’ protected characteristics, which may in itself be problematic. Here, we address this issue by using a multi-task neural network architecture for claim predictions, which can be trained using only partial information on protected characteristics and produces prices that are free from proxy discrimination. We demonstrate the proposed method on both synthetic data and a real-world motor claims dataset, in which proxy discrimination can be observed. In both examples we find that the predictive accuracy of the multi-task network is comparable to a conventional feed-forward neural network, when the protected information is available for at least half of the insurance policies. However, the multi-task network has superior performance in the case when the protected information is known for less than half of the insurance policyholders. © The Author(s) 2023.",-1,10.1007/s13385-023-00367-z,"This paper addresses the issue of proxy discrimination in predictive modeling for insurance pricing by developing a multi-task neural network that can operate with partial information on protected characteristics.

"This paper introduces near-real time data on Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and uses these data to investigate the short-term impact of occupation and violence on local economic activity. The data project – VIINA (Violent Incident Information from News Articles) – parses news reports from Ukrainian and Russian media, georeferences them, and classifies them into standard event categories (e.g. artillery shelling) through machine learning. As we show, VIINA is more geographically comprehensive and more thoroughly documented than other open-source event databases on Ukraine, and is the only such effort to track territorial control. We illustrate applications for research on political economy, by utilizing remote sensing data on luminosity and vegetation as proxies for urban economic activity and agricultural land use. We find that economic activity declined most in urban areas that neither side fully controlled, and in places most exposed to artillery shelling. Areas under Russian occupation, however, were more insulated from these negative shocks.

"Photographic images help customers perceive product information more accurately and clearly. A customer’s perception of a particular product also influences their decision to purchase it. In the context of a hotel, guests evaluate digital hotel photos online during their booking decision process. While a large body of research has contributed to the understanding of how hotel online digital images shape hotel customer behaviour, little is known about the aesthetics, content, and composition of hotel images and their effects on booking decisions. In addition, previous research has routinely been criticised for having methodological limitations. These studies have routinely used surveys and experiments to explore how hotel pictures affect customer perception of the hotel and his/her booking intentions. Unlike prior studies, this research scopes a determination of the ‘selling’ properties pertinent to the hotel’s digital images placed online on the hotel-themed websites with the application of the latest technologies pursuant to visual data mining, processing and analysis. This study employed Google’s Inception v3 neural network as an AI solution for embedding and classifying hotel photo images with the further application of logistic regression and fuzzy cognitive mapping method. The results of the present study determined the hotel picture properties that may engender positive customer perception of the hotel and sequentially can precipitate hotel booking. The revealed ‘selling’ hotel image properties comprise (a) light and time of the photo shooting, (b) image colour scheme, (c) human presence, and (d) shooting angle.

"We propose a data-driven machine learning approach to flag bid-rigging cartels in the Brazilian road maintenance sector. First, we apply a clustering algorithm to group the tenders based on their attributes. Second, we use the labels created by the clustering algorithm as a target variable to predict them using a classifier. We rank the screens according to their relevance to decrease the number of false positive (detecting cartel when it does not exist) and false negative (not detecting cartel when it does exist) predictions. Our results shed light on the need to use a range of screens to recognize the vast profile of strategies practiced by bid-rigging cartels, such as misleading competitive dynamics, bid combination, and cover bidding behavior. Our method can improve cartels’ deterrence in different economic sectors, especially when labeled data are not available. In a controlled environment with a simulated labeled dataset, the overall average accuracy of the algorithm is 99.33%. In a real-world cartel case with a labeled dataset, the overall average accuracy is 80.25%.

"Abstract: High-growth firms (HGFs), also known as gazelle firms, have attracted considerable attention due to their outstanding contributions to job creation and additional spillover benefits. Despite years of work, it is still challenging to predict high-growth firms, and many essential HGF characteristics are yet unknown. This study analyzes high-quality Korean firm data and predicts high-growth firms using big data and machine learning methods, such as LASSO, adaptive LASSO, and random forest analysis. Besides, we include variables related to business strategies and activities such as innovation, information systems like ERP, outsourcing, strategic alliances, and expansion to international markets to determine whether the addition of this information enhances HGF prediction. We discovered the significance of revenue growth, efficiency management, asset investment, and human resource management skills in increasing one’s chances of becoming an HGF.

Specifically, a rise in female board representation by one standard deviation improves an innovative culture by 4.37%. The findings corroborate the argument that female directors infuse the firm with new ideas and different perspectives, thereby enhancing an innovative culture. Furthermore, we also show that female board representation's interaction with the takeover market, which is a crucial external governance mechanism, spurs a corporate innovation culture as well.

"Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the most important technologies of the future (Crew, 2020). So far, however, AI has been insufficiently deployed. This applies not only to family businesses, but especially to them. In terms of decision-making, these companies have a number of specific characteristics which mean that they find AI less relevant and may also be skeptical. The article discusses specifics of AI use in family businesses on the basis of a German empirical study. The paper shows that family businesses use AI less frequently and are also less open to the technology than non-family businesses. Socioemotional wealth (SEW) (Gómez-Mejia et al., 2007) serves as the theoretical basis. Based on the SEW, it is argued that although family businesses are aware of the need to apply new theories, they have so far underestimated the potentials and tend to be rather skeptical about applying these technologies. This view is supported by the empirical study. In addition, some differences between small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and large companies are also discussed in the paper. © 2023 The Authors.",-1,10.22495/cgobrv7i1p7,"This paper examines the adoption of AI in family businesses, highlighting their skepticism and lower usage compared to non-family firms.

"Customer churn prediction has become an increasingly important issue in global business, especially in the banking industry, where customer acquisition has become ever more costly in this notoriously competitive business environment. Although many methods have been proposed to solve this issue as a classification problem, there are few studies that consider customer values in the light of attrition analysis. In this paper, we propose a framework to address this, and we quantify customer values with the use of an improved customer value model, examining them from the perspective of their recency, frequency, monetary value and asset level. We take customer values as the basis of misclassification costs that, in turn, direct machine learning predictive models. The returns for banks in this scenario can be maximized, given various cutoffs and some assumptions.

"-New technology trends, mainly related to the development of Industry 4.0 and the digital economy, have created significant prerequisites for changing the priorities of industrial policy. This topic is particularly relevant for countries with economies in transition or developing economies, including Russia. The accumulated structural gap, expressed in the level of industries' digitalization, indicates a low willingness of industrial enterprises to introduce digital and related advanced technologies. The data obtained show that this gap is especially pronounced (more than 50% of the average for the EU countries) in the manufacturing industry, oil and gas industry, and transport. In mining, this gap approaches 70%. These circumstances predetermined the need to identify the strategic vector of Russian industrial policy against the background of the developing modern technologies that predetermine the adjustment of industrial policy priorities. To assess the potential of industrial transformation, the authors conducted a comparative analysis of changed targets for the formation of industrial policy in the developed countries and Russia. The analysis showed a sharp evolution in the priorities of industrial policy in Russia – those changed six times during the period from 2014 through 2019. The strategic policy focus has shifted from supporting projects in the production of high-tech civilian and/or dual-use products by enterprises of the military-industrial complex and the transition of enterprises to the best available technologies to supporting the digital economy and artificial intelligence technologies.

"Electronic gambling (‘slot’) machines are a key component of the global gambling industry. We introduce a theoretical framework which shows that under reasonable assumptions, shifting from a per-machine licence fee to a gross profits tax (GPT) on machine revenue can help to resolve policy tensions between industry profitability, economic growth and government revenue. We test the theory using data on recent changes to gambling taxation in the UK, in particular the move to a gross profits-based Machine Games Duty (MGD). Our results reveal that the shift from licence fees to a revenue-neutral MGD led to a significant increase in the number of machines, as predicted by the theory, and in machine revenue.

"This study investigates whether and how digital transformation affects corporate labor investment efficiency. Based on a sample of Chinese listed firms from 2008 to 2020, this paper finds that digital transformation increases corporate labor investment efficiency. Our results still hold after using a series of robustness checks. Mechanism tests show that reducing agency problems and mitigating financing restrictions are potential channels through which digital transformation improves corporate labor investment efficiency. Further analyses reveal that digital transformation reduces both overinvestment and underinvestment in labor. Distinguishing different digital technologies, we find that artificial intelligence, big data, cloud computing technology, as well as digital technology applications improve corporate labor investment efficiency, while the impact of blockchain technology is insignificant.

"The ongoing 'digital transformation' fundamentally changes audit evidence's nature, recording, and volume. Nowadays, the International Standards on Auditing (ISA) requires auditors to examine vast volumes of a financial statement's underlying digital accounting records. As a result, audit firms also 'digitize' their analytical capabilities and invest in Deep Learning (DL), a successful sub-discipline of Machine Learning. The application of DL offers the ability to learn specialized audit models from data of multiple clients, e.g., organizations operating in the same industry or jurisdiction. In general, regulations require auditors to adhere to strict data confidentiality measures. At the same time, recent intriguing discoveries showed that large-scale DL models are vulnerable to leaking sensitive training data information. Today, it often remains unclear how audit firms can apply DL models while complying with data protection regulations. In this work, we propose a Federated Learning framework to train DL models on auditing relevant accounting data of multiple clients.

"Prior research provides mixed evidence about whether competition among auditors impairs or improves audit quality. An impediment to this stream of research is the inability of researchers to observe the audit engagement bidding process. We develop a method of detecting bidding by applying a machine learning algorithm to non-incumbent (i.e., competitor) auditor views of public companies’ SEC filings. We validate our method using a proprietary sample where all instances of bidding are known. We then examine the associations between bidding, audit quality, and audit pricing. Contrary to concerns that competitive pressure may cause auditors to compromise their independence, we find that incumbent auditors perform higher quality audits during bidding years. This improvement in audit quality occurs regardless of whether the bidding ultimately results in an auditor change and persists for several years when the incumbent auditor wins reappointment.

However, such automation challenges consumer trust, as there is considerable public and scholarly debate over the ‘black box’ character of many algorithms. Insurance being a business of trust, this suggests a dilemma. One suggested solution involves adopting algorithms in a transparent manner. This article reports a study of how Swedish insurers deal with this dilemma, based on (i) eight interviews with insurance professionals representing four companies with a joint market share of 45–50% of the Swedish property insurance market and (ii) a questionnaire answered by 71 professionals in a Swedish insurance company.

"International audit standards require the direct assessment of a financial statement's underlying accounting transactions, referred to as journal entries. Recently, driven by the advances in artificial intelligence, deep learning inspired audit techniques have emerged in the field of auditing vast quantities of journal entry data. Nowadays, the majority of such methods rely on a set of specialized models, each trained for a particular audit task. At the same time, when conducting a financial statement audit, audit teams are confronted with (i) challenging time-budget constraints, (ii) extensive documentation obligations, and (iii) strict model interpretability requirements. As a result, auditors prefer to harness only a single preferably 'multi-purpose' model throughout an audit engagement.

The framework encompasses deliberate interacting data augmentation policies that utilize the attribute characteristics of journal entry data. We evaluate the framework on two real-world datasets of city payments and transfer the learned representations to three downstream audit tasks: anomaly detection, audit sampling, and audit documentation. Our experimental results provide empirical evidence that the proposed framework offers the ability to increase the efficiency of audits by learning rich and interpretable 'multi-task' representations.  © 2021 ACM.",-1,10.1145/3490354.3494373,"This paper proposes a self-supervised learning framework to create multi-purpose models for auditing journal entries, addressing the need for efficiency and interpretability in audit tasks.

"Each decision-making, a fundamental human process, has been more and more supported by computer systems in the second part of the last century the so-called decision support systems (DSS). In the twenty-first century, intelligent decision support systems (IDSS) utilize artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to enhance and improve support for decision-makers. Ethics, as the branch of philosophy dealing with concepts of right and wrong conduct, was solely attributed to human intelligence, behaviour or decision. With artificial intelligence-based systems, the notion AI Ethics (or machine ethics) refers to ethical decision-making by machines. Specifically, in the field of IDSS, where AI techniques participate (at least partially) in the decision-making process, it is of utmost importance to design such systems with ethical considerations. In this paper, we present a classification of ethical values as an underlying concept for a framework consisting in a set of rules that need to be part of any IDSS design. Applied to a decision process for candidate pre-selection (e.g. hiring), we illustrate the pitfalls that lead to biased decisions and methods for mitigation of “wrong decisions”, from an ethical point of view.

"This article examines the financial elements of agricultural production digital architecture in Russia during the transition to the fourth technological stage in order to compete and import substitution in the agro-industrial market of the country. The pandemic and its consequences have had a negative impact on the Russian economy, in the context of the country's insufficient food security and the inevitable increase in prices for imported goods, due to rising prices for hydrocarbons and the predominance of low-value-added food products in exports. Due to the weakening of the ruble against the falling oil prices, the economy may face the need for a new wave of import substitution. This study identifies the problems of the agricultural sector and the reasons for Russia’s high dependence on imports justify the need to develop high-tech technologies.

"We examine the impacts of potential artificial intelligence (AI) regulations on managers’ perceptions on ethical issues related to AI and their intentions to adopt AI technologies. We conduct a randomized online survey experiment on more than a thousand managers in the United States. We randomly present managers with different proposed AI regulations, and ask about ethical issues related to AI and their intentions related to AI adoption. We find that information about AI regulation increases manager perception of the importance of safety, privacy, bias/discrimination, and transparency issues related to AI. However, there is a tradeoff; regulation information reduces manager intent to adopt AI technologies. Moreover, information about regulation increases manager intent to spend on developing AI strategy including ethical issues at the cost of investing in AI adoption, such as providing AI training to current employees or purchasing AI software packages. © The Author(s) 2022.

"We discover the impacts of FinTech on operational risk in the context of Chinese commercial banks from 2008 to 2019. Based on the massive amount of data collected manually, we find that FinTech and its subtypes, except for mobile internet, significantly reduce operational risk. Specifically, the baseline results reveal that for one unit increase in the FinTech index, the decrease in operational risk is about 1.414 units. For different types of FinTech, artificial intelligence (AI) has the most significant impact on operational risk, and for an increase of one unit of the AI index, operational risk is reduced by 4.033 units. Moreover, we find that the impact of FinTech on operational risk mainly comes from the interest, leases, and dividend component and the services component; the influence of FinTech on operational risk is greater in state-owned banks compared to other commercial banks with other ownership structures.

"This study investigates the impact of financial technology (FinTech) on inclusive growth (IG) by exploiting a panel of 281 prefecture-level Chinese cities in the years 2011–2020 using the spatial econometric model and machine learning algorithm. The results show that FinTech positively impacts IG, while there is no spatial spillover effect. The evidence from the machine learning algorithms suggests that as FinTech advances to a higher level, its positive impact on IG increases. The mechanism test shows that the latter effect is achieved through entrepreneurial stimulation and human capital enhancement. Moreover, the impact of FinTech on IG is more pronounced in large and medium-sized cities and cities in the eastern region. However, it does not significantly affect small cities or cities in the central region.

"This article constructs the subsystems of modern finance and the real economy by selecting indicators. Using the method of coupling coordination analysis, it measures the coordination status of 30 provinces (municipalities, autonomous regions) in China. The findings show that only 7 provinces are in a coordinated state, while the remaining 23 provinces are in a disordered state. To address this general lack of coordination, we analyze the direct and indirect mechanisms of artificial intelligence (AI) based on its principles of operation and conduct empirical tests. In the empirical analysis, we measure the level of AI innovation development using patent data from the Qizhidao Database and the level of AI technology application using data on industrial robot penetration from the International Federation of Robotics. We employ panel data at the provincial level from 2010 to 2019 and conduct least squares regression tests on the direct and indirect effects of AI. The results are significant and pass robustness tests, endogeneity tests, and heterogeneity tests. The research findings indicate that AI can directly promote the coordinated development of green finance and the real economy by addressing information asymmetry and other issues. It can also indirectly promote their coordinated development by improving institutional levels, technological levels, human capital levels, and government governance capabilities.

"In the future, artificially intelligent algorithms will make more and more decisions on behalf of humans that involve humans’ social preferences. They can learn these preferences through the repeated observation of human behavior in social encounters. In such a context, do individuals adjust the selfishness or prosociality of their behavior when it is common knowledge that their actions produce various externalities through the training of an algorithm? In an online experiment, we let participants’ choices in dictator games train an algorithm. Thereby, they create an externality on future decision making of an intelligent system that affects future participants. We show that individuals who are aware of the consequences of their training on the payoffs of a future generation behave more prosocially, but only when they bear the risk of being harmed themselves by future algorithmic choices.

"Purpose: The goal of this paper is to present a roadmap for real estate operating companies (REOCs) to transform themselves into tech-centric enterprises. Design/methodology/approach: This qualitative approach is based on the impact of technology on physical real estate assets and organisational structures as reviewed in industry and academic literature, professional experience and current property technology (PropTech) applications. Findings: New technologies are rapidly changing how investors, tenants and managers use, invest and finance property. The revolutionary change for the industry will be in its organisational and industry structure, away from the traditional hierarchical-mechanistic form to a virtual open-agile-innovative organisational form. Research limitations/implications: Research limitations come from the lack of real estate companies utilising the hybrid flipped form of organisational structures. Practical implications: Due to the current state of the economy, effects of the pandemic and rapid adoption of new technologies, real estate companies are likely to radically change the way they are organised, how they add value, innovate and their leadership/management style. Social implications: The revolution in real estate technologisation will not come from the application of these technologies but the rapid change in ideological thought and management leadership style and culture. Originality/value: The introduction of artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML), blockchain, virtual reality, tablets, cell phones, applications, 5G, etc. is putting pressure on real estate organisations to change.

"This paper dynamically measures news-driven information friction in China's carbon market theoretically and empirically. The biggest difference between this paper and the existing literature is that this paper does not assume that the information shock is a white noise process but that the information shock comes from the news. This study does not use fiscal expenditure budget data and fiscal expenditure final data to estimate information friction but rather extends the standard Fève and Pietrunti (2016) theoretical framework to identify effective information and noise signals from market policy news by machine learning. A latent Dirichlet allocation model is employed to estimate the variance of effective information. China's carbon policy uncertainty as indicated by Chinese-language newspapers is used to estimate the variance of the noise signal. Therefore, we can calculate time-varying high-frequency information friction. The results of this study show that enterprises with different attributes in the same industry face different information friction. In China, state-owned industrial enterprises have the lowest levels of information friction. Joint-stock industrial enterprises have the highest levels of information friction. The higher the degree of policy information friction, the weaker the impact of effective information shocks and the greater the reduction in policy effects. These results have policy implications – the government should pay attention to enterprise attributes to reduce policy uncertainty and the degree of policy information friction, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of policy regulation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",-1,10.1016/j.eneco.2020.104994,"This paper measures news-driven information friction in China's carbon market, using a machine learning approach to analyze the impact of policy news on information signals.

"Modeling policyholders' lapse behaviors is important to a life insurer, since lapses affect pricing, reserving, profitability, liquidity, risk management, and the solvency of the insurer. In this paper, we apply two machine learning methods to lapse modeling. Then, we evaluate the performance of these two methods along with two popular statistical methods by means of statistical accuracy and profitability measure. Moreover, we adopt an innovative point of view on the lapse prediction problem that comes from churn management. We transform the classification problem into a regression question and then perform optimization, which is new to lapse risk management. We apply the aforementioned four methods to a large real-world insurance dataset. The results show that Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and support vector machine outperform logistic regression (LR) and classification and regression tree with respect to statistic accuracy, while LR performs as well as XGBoost in terms of retention gains. This highlights the importance of a proper validation metric when comparing different methods. The optimization after the transformation brings out significant and consistent increases in economic gains.

"The study analyzes the impact of fintech adoption on the banking sector's stability in GCC countries from 2010 to 2022. The study also considers the role of fintech regulations in this framework. We construct an index of fintech adoption by banks by considering several factors such as banks' digital presence, mobile banking capabilities, support for open APIs, fintech partnerships, digital payment solutions, automation and artificial intelligence integration, innovation initiatives, user experience focus and embracing new technologies. The regulatory environment is measured through the existence or introduction of fintech-related regulations such as the regulatory sandbox. The findings imply that fintech adoption has reduced banks' stability in GCC. The fintech-stability relationship varies over various bank-specific and country-specific variables. For instance, large and well-capitalized banks are less likely to experience adverse effects of fintech adoption. Moreover, the negative impact of fintech on financial stability is lower for Islamic, foreign and government banks.

"Abstract: The fourth industrial revolution will form a new digital economy in Russia, dominated by smart objects (factories, transport, roads, buildings, etc.) with artificial intelligence systems. There are currently no studies on identifying the territorial structure of Russia’s future digital economy. Due to the inertia of the existing settlement system and the agglomeration economy, it has been assumed that the future territorial structure will be represented by smart urban agglomerations and regions. It has been established that the most critical parameter for controlling smart objects is signal delay in telecommunication networks. It has been proposed to draw the borders of digital agglomerations and regions based on isochrons of 1 and 10 ms delays with adjustment of borders for the extreme proximity or remoteness of regional centers. The signal delay between 1112 cities of Russia has been determined. Forty-three digital agglomerations and 45 regions were selected.

By interpreting AI as a new type of agent within the firm, the theory of the firm can serve as a lingua franca to connect computer sciences and social sciences when dealing with the interdisciplinary phenomenon of AI. To achieve this, this paper adopts the perspective of the economic theory of the firm to systematically explore the changes that AI brings to the institution of the firm. In total, five interrelated propositions are discussed that are rooted in the traditional theory but trace the nature of the Artificially Intelligent Firm: AI intensifies the effects of economic rationality on the firm (1). AI introduces a new type of information asymmetry (2). AI can perforate the boundaries of the firm (3). AI can create triangular agency relationships (4) and AI has the potential to remove traditional limits of integration (5). © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",-1,10.1016/j.telpol.2020.101954,"This paper explores the implications of AI on the nature of firms through the lens of economic theory.

"Research background:Digitalization in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerat-ed significantly across Europe, including in regions that are at the stage of catch-up develop-ment. However, as innovative technologies are intensively integrated into everyday life, the digital gap between the EU countries is increasing. The widening digital gap is becoming a serious threat to achieving the EU's sustainable development goals and building a sustainable European society. Purpose of the article: The purpose of the article was to empirically substantiate the inclu-siveness and convergence of the digital strategy in the EU countries. Methods: Using the method of fuzzy sets, the level of asymmetry in access to transactional (e-commerce), information (cloud computing), operational (artificial intelligence) technologies in the EU countries was assessed. The negative impact of the digital gap within the countries (the gap between small, medium, large companies) and the global digital gap (the gap between EU countries) on the competitiveness of countries was established, for which correla-tion analysis and the Granger causality test were used. Findings & value added: The findings of this study contribute to the literature of digital transformation and digital gap of European countries. The impact of the digital gap in transac-tional, information, operational technologies on the competitiveness of countries is differenti-ated depending on the level of digitalization of the country. Cluster groups of countries are determined by the convergence of digitalization and ways to ensure long-term competitive-ness. The directions for reducing the digital gap in the EU countries are substantiated by changing the priorities of spending on innovation and increasing productivity, diversifying the digital technologies used. The empirical results obtained can serve as a basis for improving the effectiveness of the digitalization policy in the EU countries in accordance with individual convergence goals. The main added value of the paper is related to the presented research procedure, which can be used in analyses of digital technologies development also for other countries.

"This is the first study analyzing the volatility connectedness and time-frequency interdependence between AI index and clean energy index. Specifically, we use the QVAR frequency connectedness, Wavelet Local Multiple Correlations (WLMC) and Granger causality quantile methods to check the risk spillovers and multivariate time and frequency relationships among the eight clean energy indexes and the AI index. This is over the period from December 18, 2017 to April 4, 2023. Our results show: (1) NASDAQ OMX Geothermal Index is the strongest net sender of short- and long-term shocks in the system during extreme upside market conditions. In downturn conditions, the S&P Global Clean Energy Index is the largest net shock sender. The AI Index exports shocks at all frequencies. In addition, market connectedness among markets is stronger under extreme market conditions.

"We use BERT, an AI-based algorithm for language understanding, to quantify regulatory climate risk disclosures and analyze their impact on the term structure in the credit default swap (CDS) market. Risk disclosures can either increase or decrease CDS spreads, depending on whether the disclosure reveals new risks or reduces uncertainty. Training BERT to differentiate between transition and physical climate risks, we find that disclosing transition risks increases CDS spreads after the Paris Climate Agreement of 2015, while disclosing physical risks decreases the spreads. In addition, we also find that the election of Trump had a negative impact on CDS spreads for firms exposed to transition risk.

"The purpose is to apply artificial intelligence to enterprise intelligent audit, improve the efficiency of enterprise audit, and finally supervise and manage the enterprise revenue and expenditure timely and accurately. First, the classification, processing and storage of enterprise intelligent audit data are analyzed. An improved DLNN (Dynamic Learning Neural Network) algorithm model is proposed according to the deep learning theory to carry out intelligent audit on enterprise data, and BiLSTM (Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory) model is adopted to analyze the classification accuracy of audit. Then, the Auto Encoder based on data compression algorithm is adopted to analyze the audit data. Finally, genetic algorithm is applied to the weight optimization of a deep learning network. The economic benefit evaluation data information of X enterprise in 2018 is selected. The current values of relevant indexes are compared with historical data. The results suggest that the performance of the deep learning neural network model optimized by the genetic algorithm is improved. After optimization, the precision of the model is improved from 81 to 87%, the accuracy of the model is improved from 92 to 96%, and the F1 score of the model is reduced from 3.5 to 2.3%.

"Capitalizing on a distinctive measure of corporate culture obtained from sophisticated machine learning, we investigate the concept of cultural diversification. A firm is culturally diversified if it is characterized by a variety of diverse cultural attributes. Motivated by agency theory, we hypothesize that risk-averse managers favor cultural diversification, but, owing to agency problems, tend to over-invest in cultural diversification. More effective governance in the form of stronger board independence mitigates the agency conflict, lowering the level of cultural diversification and bringing it closer to the optimal level where shareholder value is maximized. Our results strongly support this hypothesis. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",-1,10.1016/j.jbef.2022.100773,"This paper uses machine learning to measure corporate culture and examines the relationship between cultural diversification and governance.

"Urban rail transit investments are expensive and irreversible. As people differ with respect to their demand for trips, their value of time, and the types of real estate they live in, such projects are likely to offer heterogeneous benefits to residents of a city. Defining the opening of a major new subway in Seoul as a treatment for apartments close to the new rail stations, we contrast hedonic estimates based on multivariate hedonic methods with a machine learning (ML) approach. This ML approach yields new estimates of these heterogeneous effects. While a majority of the “treated” apartment types appreciate in value, other types decline in value. We cross-validate our estimates by studying what types of new housing units developers build in the treated areas close to the new train lines. © 2018 American Real Estate and Urban Economics Association",-1,10.1111/1540-6229.12249,"This paper examines the heterogeneous effects of urban rail transit investments on apartment values using both hedonic methods and a machine learning approach.

"Purpose: This study provides valuable insights to managers aiming to increase the effectiveness of their diversification and growth portfolios. The purpose of this paper is to examine the value of utilizing a neural networks (NNs) approach using mergers and acquisition (M&A) data confined in the US technology domain. Design/methodology/approach: Using data from Bloomberg for the period 2000–2016, the results confirm that an NN approach provides more explanation between financial variables in the model than a traditional regression model where the NN approach of this study is then compared with linear classifier, logistic regression. The empirical results show that NN is a promising method of evaluating M&A takeover targets in terms of their predictive accuracy and adaptability. Findings: The findings emphasize the value alternative methodologies provide in high-technology industries in order to achieve the screening and explorative performance objectives, given the technological complexity, market uncertainty and the divergent skill sets required for breakthrough innovations in these sectors. Research limitations/implications: NN methods do not provide for a fuller analysis of significance for each of the autonomous variables in the model as traditional regression methods do. The generalization breadth of this study is limited within a specific sector (technology) in a specific country (USA) covering a specific period (2000–2016). Practical implications: Investors value firms before investing in them to identify their true stock price; yet, technology firms pose a great valuation challenge to investors and analysts alike as the latest information technology stock price bubbles, Silicon Valley and as the recent stratospheric rise of financial technology companies have also demonstrated. Social implications: Numerous studies have shown that M&As are more often than not destroy value rather than create it. More than 50 percent of all M&As lead to a decline in relative total shareholder return after one year. Hence, effective target identification must be built on the foundation of a credible strategy that identifies the most promising market segments for growth, assesses whether organic or acquisitive growth is the best way forward and defines the commercial and financial hurdles for potential deals. Originality/value: Technology firm value is directly dependent on growth, consequently most of the value will originate from future customers or products not from current assets that makes it challenging for investors to measure a firm’s beta (risk) where the value of a technology is only known after its commercialization to the market.

"We use a discrete choice model to study the impact of tax incentives on firm location choices in situations involving heterogeneous geographic characteristics, heterogeneous firm preferences and large choice sets. We apply our model to investigate the impact of movie production incentives on filming location choices for movies produced from 1999 to 2013. We gather the characteristics of filming locations and use a machine-learning technique to define choice sets. We find production incentives can attract movies to a state, but the impact depends on the type of incentive offered, studio characteristics and inherent location geographic characteristics. Mid-sized studios respond to all forms of incentives, major studios respond only to refundable and transferable tax credits, and independent studios are not sensitive to any incentives. We fail to find strong evidence that incentives create a more permanent movie industry in a state. A counterfactual identifies the states most impacted by these policies. We supplement our discrete choice model with a simple cost-benefit analysis, which indicates that movie incentive programs are revenue-negative for states. © The Author(s) (2018).

"When economists talk about ‘measurement’ they tend to refer to metrics that can capture changes in quantity, quality and distribution of goods and services. In this paper we argue that the digital transformation of the economy, particularly the rise of cloud computing as a general-purpose technology, can pose serious challenges to traditional concepts and practices of economic measurement. In the first part we show how quality-adjusted prices of cloud services have been falling rapidly over the past decade, which is currently not captured by the deflators used in official statistics. We then discuss how this enabled the spread of data-driven business models, while also lowering entry barriers to advanced production techniques such as artificial intelligence or robotic-process-automation. It is likely that these process innovations are not fully measured at present. A final challenge to measurement arises from the fragmentation of value chains across borders and increasing use of intangible intermediate inputs such as intellectual property and data. While digital technologies make it very easy for these types of inputs to be transferred within or between companies, existing economic statistics often fail to capture them at all. © 2019 National Institute of Economic and Social Research.",-1,10.1177/002795011924900112,"This paper discusses the challenges posed by digital transformation, particularly cloud computing, to traditional economic measurement practices.

"With wildfire-risk rising globally, the role of home insurance continues to remain under-studied in the search for mechanisms to mitigate loss from wildfire. This study investigates whether insurance policies effectively discourage homeownership in fire-prone zones. Using zip-code level data from Los Angeles between 2011 and 2018, we employ linear regression, GMM and machine-learning to examine the extent to which wildfire-risk impacts FAIR plan vis-a-vis market insurance. Results indicate that insurance policies do not effectively disincentivize homeowners away from high-risk zones which is novel to the existing literature. This is because the marginal impact of wildfire-risk on both insurance premiums, is relatively lower compared to other factors, especially for private insurance.

"Geographical Indications (GIs), as Protected Designation of Origin (PDO)and Protected Geographical Indication (PGI), offer a unique protection scheme to preserve high-quality agri-food productions and support sustainable rural development at the territorial level. However, not all the areas with traditional agri-food products are acknowledged with a GI. Examining the Italian wine sector by a geo-referenced database and a machine learning framework, we show that municipalities which obtain a GI within the subsequent 10 year period (2002–2011) can be predicted using a large set of (lagged) municipality-level data (1981–2001). We find that the Random Forest algorithm is the best model to make out-of-sample predictions of municipalities which obtain GIs. Results show that there is a sort of optimal territorial condition characterized by the successful matching of wine-growing profession (vineyards), local actors involved (number of farmers), and physical dimension of farms (middle farms). Being in a vital economic system and the distance from major urban centers also emerges among the main relevant features in predicting the success of GIs.

"Artificial intelligence (AI) is considered the next strategic technological imperative as it allows firms to manage complex tasks and to solve problems in many industries. In the manufacturing context, the use of AI is affecting the configuration of production processes with possible effects on the location of production activities. Despite the increasing relevance of this technology, there is a lack of empirical evidence that assesses the linkage with the firm's production relocation strategies. To fill this gap, this study aims at exploring the relationship between the use of AI and companies' offshoring and backshoring decisions, taking into account the moderating role of digital competences and the intended internationalisation strategies. Based on a cross-national survey with answers from 676 manufacturing companies from 16 industrialized countries, a hierarchical regression analysis was deployed that shows a positive effect of AI on companies' offshoring and backshoring decisions. Moreover, the results show that digital competences and international ambidexterity (simultaneous expansion of business and supply chain activities in domestic and foreign locations) only have a moderation effect on the relationship between AI and backshoring. International concentration (locating business activities in only a few local or global locations) does not moderate the relationship between AI and production relocation strategies (offshoring or backshoring). To advance the theoretical debate on the use of AI and its impact on production relocation strategies, three research propositions are proposed.

"The role of artificial intelligence (AI) in organizations has fundamentally changed from performing routine tasks to supervising human employees. While prior studies focused on normative perceptions of such AI supervisors, employees’ behavioral reactions towards them remained largely unexplored. We draw from theories on AI aversion and appreciation to tackle the ambiguity within this field and investigate if and why employees might adhere to unethical instructions either from a human or an AI supervisor. In addition, we identify employee characteristics affecting this relationship. To inform this debate, we conducted four experiments (total N = 1701) and used two state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms (causal forest and transformers). We consistently find that employees adhere less to unethical instructions from an AI than a human supervisor. Further, individual characteristics such as the tendency to comply without dissent or age constitute important boundary conditions. In addition, Study 1 identified that the perceived mind of the supervisors serves as an explanatory mechanism. We generate further insights on this mediator via experimental manipulations in two pre-registered studies by manipulating mind between two AI (Study 2) and two human supervisors (Study 3). In (pre-registered) Study 4, we replicate the resistance to unethical instructions from AI supervisors in an incentivized experimental setting.

"This article explores the potential of artificial intelligence for identifying cases where digital vendors fail to comply with legal obligations, an endeavour that can generate insights about business practices. While heated regulatory debates about online platforms and AI are currently ongoing, we can look to existing horizontal norms, especially concerning the fairness of standard terms, which can serve as a benchmark against which to assess business-to-consumer practices in light of European Union law. We argue that such an assessment can to a certain extent be automated; we thus present an AI system for the automatic detection of unfair terms in business-to-consumer contracts, a system developed as part of the CLAUDETTE project. On the basis of the dataset prepared in this project, we lay out the landscape of contract terms used in different digital consumer markets and theorize their categories, with a focus on five categories of clauses concerning (i) the limitation of liability, (ii) unilateral changes to the contract and/or service, (iii) unilateral termination of the contract, (iv) content removal, and (v) arbitration. In so doing, the paper provides empirical support for the broader claim that AI systems for the automated analysis of textual documents can offer valuable insights into the practices of online vendors and can also provide valuable help in their legal qualification.

"Artificial intelligence (AI) is a fundamental driver of technological and economic growth. However, few studies have focused on the impact of AI industry agglomeration on economic complexity. This study uses a unique dataset of 2,503,795 AI enterprises in China collected through web crawlers to measure AI industrial agglomeration and examine the relationship between AI industry agglomeration and economic complexity in 194 Chinese cities based on Marshall industry agglomeration theory. The study’s results show that AI industry clustering increases economic complexity. The mechanism analysis indicates that people and knowledge are the channels through which it boosts economic complexity. Unexpectedly, AI industry agglomeration does not improve the economic complexity index (ECI) through the goods path. This study proposes three possible explanations for this result. First, AI industrial clustering may lead to excessive rivalry in China’s intermediate product market. Hence, sharing intermediate inputs has no increasing returns effect. Second, the city's high-end talent is not fairly distributed due to China's uneven development. Finally, policies drive the formation of China’s AI industrial agglomeration, which does not develop naturally. Consequently, China should implement a talent- and knowledge-driven AI agglomeration. To avoid overcrowding, policies must match regional development. © 2022 The Author(s).

"Many information and communications technology (ICT) services have become commonplace worldwide and are certain to continue to spread faster than before, particularly along with the commercialization of 5G and movement restrictions in response to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Although there is a concern that ICT equipment usage may increase power consumption and emit greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, ICT has also been contributing to reducing GHG emissions through improved productivity and reduced mobility. This research targeted the main ICT services used in Japan and adopted a dynamic national computable general equilibrium model to quantitatively analyze future impacts on economic growth and GHG emission reduction until 2030 by using these ICTs, while considering both the increase in power consumption of ICT itself and the reduction in environmental load in other sectors. The results showed that the spread of ICT services, especially some artificial intelligence-based services, can improve productivity in most sectors through labor-saving and contribute to improving overall gross domestic product (GDP). Additionally, increased efficiency of logistics and manufacturing can greatly reduce the input of oil and coal products and so greatly contribute to GHG emission reduction. In 2030, compared with the baseline scenario in which all technology levels are fixed at current levels, at least 1% additional GDP growth and 4% GHG emission reduction can be expected by the targeted introduction of ICT in the ICT accelerated scenario in which the technology level of ICT accelerates.

"The United States coastline, where over 50% the population lives, is vulnerable to hurricanes along the East and Gulf coasts. However, the question remains as to whether these two areas are equally resilient to a landfalling hurricane. In addition, while it is assumed that improvements in building codes, infrastructure protections, and changing policy over the past century have been effective in reducing the impacts to a community from historically extreme hurricane events, such an assumption is still to be validated. Here, a multi-hazard artificial neural network model is used to address these questions. The Hurricane Impact Level Model is the first prediction model to utilize machine-learning techniques (artificial neural networks) to established complex connections between all meteorological factors (wind, pressure, storm surge, and precipitation resulting in inland flooding) of a tropical cyclone and how those interact with the location of landfall to produce a certain level of economic damage. This model allows for a more all-encompassing assessment of how the impacts of tropical cyclones vary along the coastline. The Hurricane Impact Level Model was trained with historical tropical cyclone events from 1998 to present day, resulting in established locational associations to modern relevant building codes and mitigation practices. Simulating the meteorological factors from historical events allows for a new assessment of economic impact changes due to infrastructure improvements and policy adaptations over time. In essence, if Hurricane Sandy hit Florida instead of New York, it would have a lower economic impact due to lower population density and more stringent building codes, which the artificial neural network has associated with the latitudes and longitudes within the state of Florida. If the Galveston hurricane were to hit today, the seawall would not succeed in lowering the economic impact to the Texas coastline. Over the years, significant effort has been put in to improving the resiliency of the United States coastline, mainly in the southern states, but it has not been enough to counteract the effects of population growth within coastal counties. © 2017 The Author(s).",-1,10.1057/s41599-017-0016-1,"This paper develops a multi-hazard artificial neural network model to assess the economic impacts of hurricanes based on various meteorological factors and infrastructure improvements.

"Based on the panel data of 285 cities in China from 2000 to 2019, this paper searches the number of patent applications related to urban artificial intelligence from five dimensions: algorithm, data, computing power, application scenario and related technology. Combining the two perspectives of industrial upgrading and rationalization, we analyze the internal influence theory of the research topic from the theoretical and empirical perspectives. The results show that artificial intelligence is not only conducive to industrial upgrading, but also significantly inhibit the deviation of industrial structure from equilibrium, which is conducive to industrial rationalization. In addition, the conclusion of this paper is still valid after a series of robustness tests, such as eliminating the samples of central cities, winsorize treatment and instrumental variables method.

"Many retailers invest in artificial intelligence (AI) to improve operational efficiency or enhance customer experience. However, AI often disrupts employees’ ways of working causing them to resist change, thus threatening the successful embedding and sustained usage of the technology. Using a longitudinal, multi-site ethnographic approach combining 74 stakeholder interviews and 14 on-site retail observations over a 5-year period, this article examines how employees’ practices change when retailers invest in AI. Practice co-evolution is identified as the process that undergirds successful AI integration and enables retail employees’ sustained usage of AI. Unlike product or practice diffusion, which may be organic or fortuitous, practice co-evolution is an orchestrated, collaborative process in which a practice is co-envisioned, co-adapted, and co-(re)aligned.

The study employed the methods of an AI qualitative analysis according to the classification of general-purpose technologies and a regression analysis of company production factors. The author analysed the data of 21 public Russian companies in the industry of hydrocarbon production, mining and metal production for 2014-2018.

"Air pollution has profoundly impacted residents’ lifestyles as well as their willingness to pay for real estate. Exploring the relationship between air pollution and housing prices has become increasingly prominent. Current research on housing prices mainly uses the hedonic pricing model and the spatial econometric model, which are both linear methods. However, it is difficult to use these methods to model the nonlinear relationship between housing price and its determinants. In addition, most of the existing studies neglect the effects of multiple pollutants on housing prices. To fill these gaps, this study uses a machine learning approach, the gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) model to analyze the nonlinear impacts of air pollution and the built environment on housing prices in Shanghai. The experimental results show that the GBDT can better fit the nonlinear relationship between housing prices and various explanatory variables compared with traditional linear models. Furthermore, the relative importance rankings of the built environment and air pollution variables are analyzed based on the GBDT model. It indicates that built environment variables contribute 97.21% of the influences on housing prices, whereas the contribution of air pollution variables is 2.79%. Although the impact of air pollution is relatively small, the marginal willingness of residents to pay for clean air is significant. With an improvement of 1 μg/m3 in the average concentrations of PM2.5 and NO2, the average housing price increases by 155.93 Yuan/m2 and 278.03 Yuan/m2, respectively.

"Financing constraints present a significant challenge for enterprises. Given China’s push for the integration of digital technology and the real economy, it is crucial to examine the impact of corporate digital transformation on financing. Using data from Chinese A-share listed companies from 2010 to 2019, we construct the digital transformation indicator employing a machine learning approach and find that corporate digital transformation can significantly alleviate financing constraints.

At the first step, we analyze 2211 documents in the AI&ED field using the bibliometric tool Bibliometrix, presenting the internal structure and external characteristics of the field through different metrics and algorithms. In the second step, a qualitative content analysis of clusters calculated from the bibliographic coupling algorithm is conducted, detailing the content directions of recently distributed topics in the AI&ED field from different perspectives. The results of the bibliometric analysis suggest that the number of publications in the field has grown exponentially in recent years, and the most relevant source is the “Sustainability” journal. In addition, deep learning and data mining-related research are the key directions for the future. On the whole, scholars dedicated to the field have developed close cooperation and communication across the board. On the other hand, the content analysis demonstrates that most of the research is centered on the five facets of intelligent decision-making, social governance, labor and capital, Industry 4.0, and innovation. The results provide a forward-looking guide for scholars to grasp the current state and potential knowledge gaps in the AI&ED field. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.",-1,10.1007/s13132-023-01183-2,"This paper conducts a bibliometric analysis of the intersection between AI and economic development, analyzing 2211 documents to understand the field's structure and trends.

"Applying artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and big data to natural resource management (NRM) is revolutionizing how natural resources are managed. To gain more insights into the domain, we use 394 Scopus-indexed documents to explore the thematic evolution and explore future research directions. We found that the topics related to AI, ML, and big data for natural resource management have increased significantly since 2012. While “Remote Sensing” is the most productive journal, S. Alqadhi and J. Mallick are the most contributing authors, and the United States has been the most contributing country. While the keywords “sustainable development” and “remote sensing” have been growing steadily since 1975, “natural resource modeling” and “machine learning” have been more popular during the last few years. The thematic analysis reveals that the existing literature is concentrated around four clusters, and the content analysis of the clusters uncovers 15 future research agendas. These research agendas include the development of efficient strategies for NRM, understanding the role of AI and ML in natural resource management, leveraging data-driven methods for decision-making, and developing models for interdisciplinary and cross-sectoral approaches. The study provides important implications of using technology in NRM. These technologies help policymakers create effective policies, improves assessment and decision-making, and optimizes resource use. These advancements benefit society by increasing access to essential resources in a fair manner, and they have positive impacts on both the public and private sectors, enabling evidence-based policymaking and responsible resource extraction.

"Assuming that potential biases of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based systems can be identified and controlled for (e.g., by providing high quality training data), employing such systems to augment human resource (HR)-decision makers in candidate selection provides an opportunity to make selection processes more objective. However, as the final hiring decision is likely to remain with humans, prevalent human biases could still cause discrimination. This work investigates the impact of an AI-based system’s candidate recommendations on humans’ hiring decisions and how this relation could be moderated by an Explainable AI (XAI) approach. We used a self-developed platform and conducted an online experiment with 194 participants. Our quantitative and qualitative findings suggest that the recommendations of an AI-based system can reduce discrimination against older and female candidates but appear to cause fewer selections of foreign-race candidates.

"Predicting the outcome of sales opportunities is a core part of successful business management. Conventionally, undertaking this prediction has relied mostly on subjective human evaluations in the process of sales decision-making. In this paper, we addressed the problem of forecasting the outcome of Business to Business (B2B) sales by proposing a thorough data-driven Machine-Learning (ML) workflow on a cloud-based computing platform: Microsoft Azure Machine-Learning Service (Azure ML). This workflow consists of two pipelines: (1) An ML pipeline to train probabilistic predictive models on the historical sales opportunities data. In this pipeline, data is enriched with an extensive feature enhancement step and then used to train an ensemble of ML classification models in parallel. (2) A prediction pipeline to use the trained ML model and infer the likelihood of winning new sales opportunities along with calculating optimal decision boundaries.

"The COVID-19 pandemic has brought economic activity to a near standstill as many countries imposed very strict restrictions on movement to halt the spread of the virus. This study aims at assessing the economic impacts of COVID-19 in the United Kingdom (UK) using artificial intelligence (AI) and data from previous economic crises to predict future economic impacts. The macroeconomic indicators, gross domestic products (GDP) and GDP growth, and data on the performance of three primary industries in the UK (the construction, production and service industries) were analysed using a comparison with the pattern of previous economic crises. In this research, we experimented with the effectiveness of both continuous and categorical time-series forecasting on predicting future values to generate more accurate and useful results in the economic domain. Continuous value predictions indicate that GDP growth in 2021 will remain steady, but at around −8.5% contraction, compared to the baseline figures before the pandemic. Further, the categorical predictions indicate that there will be no quarterly drop in GDP following the first quarter of 2021.

"Purpose: Intervention of artificial intelligence (AI) has brought up the issue of future job prospects in terms of the employability of the professionals and their readiness to harness the benefits of the AI. The purpose of this study is to recognize the implications of AI on employability by analyzing the issues in the health-care sector that if not addressed, can dampen the possibilities offered by AI intervention and its pervasiveness (Cornell University, INSEAD, and WIPO, 2019). Design/methodology/approach: To get an insight on these concerns, an approach of total interpretive structural modelling, cross impact matrix multiplication applied to classification and path analysis have been used to understand the role of the critical factors influencing employability in the health-care sector. Findings: This study primarily explores the driving-dependence power of the critical factors of the employability and displays hierarchical relationships. It also discusses measures which, if adopted, can enhance employability in the health-care sector with the intervention of AI.

"As part of the artificial intelligence (AI) industry there are many companies engaged in providing hardware that enhances the use of artificial intelligence technology for big data analysis, along with companies that are involved in data analytics, software, system software, and artificial intelligence software. This paper examines the quantiles-based connectedness and non-linear causality-in-quantiles nexus of AI enterprises with basic materials and oil & gas companies, and their Islamic markets. Formally, we consider two perspectives, including before and after the pandemic of COVID-19 (for period May 18, 2018–June 01, 2022). It is observed that in the network of AI-based investments and companies related to basic materials and oil & gas industries, AI is a net recipient of shocks before and during the COVID-19 era, with a higher intensity of shock-receiving in the normal market and during COVID-19-affected period than in the upper and lower tails and prior to COVID-19 period. However, AI could serve as the cause-in-quantiles of oil & gas-related companies in the Islamic markets (in both pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 timeframes) and conventional oil & gas firms (only within COVID-19). On the other hand, both the Islamic and the conventional basic materials and oil & gas businesses appear to be a non-linear cause-in-variance of the AI technology in the middle quantiles of the COVID-19 situation. Aside from this, the only causal factors from resources-based markets to AI are Islamic and conventional basic materials companies, as observed only during COVID-19. Based on our analysis, COVID-19 presented an excellent opportunity for improving the involvement of AI innovations with basic materials and oil & gas companies. As a consequence, the basic materials market may be able to provide hardware and software infrastructures to support the technology of artificial intelligence. Also, the inventions that enter the oil & gas industry due to the use of artificial intelligence could have a significant impact on their average performance.

"The last decade has witnessed an increase in the number of extreme weather events globally. In addition, the economic output around the world is at all-time high in terms of production and profitability. However, global warming and extreme weather are modifying the natural ecosystem and the human social system, leading to the appearance of extreme climate events that have an adverse impact on the world economy. To address this challenge, the present study identifies the main impacts of extreme weather on production economics based on the analysis of user-generated content (UGC) on the social network Twitter. Methodologically, a sentiment analysis with machine learning is developed and applied to analyze a sample of 1.4 m tweets; in addition, computing experiments to calculate the accuracy with Support Vector Classifier, Multinomial Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest Classifier are conducted. Second, a topic modeling known as latent Dirichlet allocation is applied to divide sentiment-classified tweets into topics. To complement these approaches, we also use the technique of textual analysis. These approaches are used under the framework of computer-aided test analysis system and natural language processing. The results are discussed and linked to appraisal theory. A total of 7 topics are identified, including positive (Sustainable energies and Green Entrepreneurs), neutral (Climate economy, Producer's productivity and Stock market), and negative (Economy and policy and Climate emergence). Finally, the present study discusses how the recent trend of an increase in extreme weather conditions has significantly impacted international markets, leading companies to adapt their business models and production systems accordingly.

"The integration of technologies across the mining value chain is becoming critical, and it is crucial to identify the best possible technologies applicable to an operation, based on the chosen criteria. This study investigates the adoptable technologies for a mining project, develops a conceptual framework for the analytical process and validates the framework using a hypothetical case study. The case study comprised of a technology decision problem, the result of which consisted of six technology alternatives, four criteria, and one decision maker. Of the several Multi-Criterial Decision Making (MCDM) techniques available, the fusion of the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and preference ranking organisation method of enrichment (PROMETHEE) techniques were used for this study. The AHP was used to determine the hierarchal weight of each decision-making criterion and its consistency, while the PROMETHEE method was used to carry out the overall process evaluation. Additionally, the fuzzy set theory was infused into the hierarchical structure analysis to evaluate the quantitative economic criterion to curb uncertainty and imprecision. The results of the analysis show that the technology alternative A3 – Artificial Intelligence (AI) – is the most preferred alternative, which outranks other comparative technologies.

"Purpose: As artificial intelligence (AI) has become increasingly popular and accessible, most companies have recognized its far-reaching potential. However, despite numerous research papers on organizational adoption of new technologies including AI, little is known about individual employees’ intentions to use them. Given that organizational innovations are of limited value if they are not adopted by employees, the purpose of this study is to understand the underlying factors that push employees to make use of these new technologies in the workplace. Design/methodology/approach: This study builds on previously developed technology acceptance models to provide a new theoretical model. The model is then tested using data collected from a survey of 203 employees and analyzed through structural equation modeling. Findings: Findings show that five factors affect employees’ intention to use AI either directly or as mediators. Organizational culture and habit exert a positive impact on employees’ intention to use AI, whereas job insecurity has a negative impact.

"Studies have shown that the level of valuation inaccuracy in Nigeria is higher than the acceptable international standard. This may be linked to the preference for traditional valuation approaches. This study investigates the readiness of Nigerian valuers to adopt the artificial intelligence (AI) property valuation techniques that have proven to be reliable and accurate in property valuation. A crosssectional study was conducted via a web-based questionnaire survey to registered estate surveyors and valuers practicing in Nigeria. The collected data were analyzed and presented with descriptive statistics in percentiles and mean score, in addition to the chi-square analysis. The results show that more than half of the respondents are aware of the AI valuation techniques. However, the techniques are not used in practice. The low adoption of the AI techniques is attributed to professional bodies responsible for regulation of real estate practice and tertiary educational institutions in Nigeria, who were not proactive enough to promote their know-how and application. It was found that active collaboration between local professional bodies and similar international organizations on member training and development may improve the usage of the AI techniques.

"We examine banks' exposure to climate transition risk using a bottom-up, loan-level methodology incorporating climate stress test based on the Merton probability of default model and transition pathways from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Specifically, we match machine learning predictions of corporate carbon footprints to syndicated loans initiated in 2010–2018 and aggregate these to loan portfolios of the twenty largest banks in the United States. Banks vary in their climate transition risk not only due to their exposure to the energy sectors but also due to borrowers' carbon emission profiles from other sectors. Banks generally lend a minimal amount to coal (0.4%) but hold a considerable exposure in oil and gas (8.6%) and electricity firms (4.6%) and thus have a large exposure to the energy sectors (13.5%). We observe that climate transition risk profile was stable over time, save for a temporary (in some cases) and permanent (in others), reduction in their fossil-fuel exposure after the Paris Agreement. From the stress testing, the median loss is 0.5% of US syndicated loans, representing a decrease in CET1 capital of 4.1% when extrapolated to the whole balance sheet. The loss is twice as large in the 1.5°C scenarios (1.4%–2.1% of loan value, 12%–16% of CET1 capital) compared to the 2°C target (0.6%–1.1% of loan value, 5%–9% of CET1 capital) with significant tail-end risk (7.7% of loan value, 62% of CET1 capital). Banks' vulnerabilities are also driven by the ex-ante financial risk of their borrowers more generally, highlighting that climate risk is not independent from conventional risks. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",-1,10.1016/j.irfa.2022.102401,"This paper assesses banks' exposure to climate transition risk using a loan-level methodology and machine learning predictions of corporate carbon footprints.

"This paper shows how data science can contribute to improving empirical research in economics by leveraging on large datasets and extracting information otherwise unsuitable for a traditional econometric approach. As a test-bed for our framework, machine learning algorithms allow to create a new holistic measure of innovation following a 2012 Italian Law aimed at boosting new high-tech firms. We adopt this measure to analyse the impact of innovativeness on a large population of Italian firms which entered the market at the beginning of the 2008 global crisis. The methodological contribution is organised in different steps. First, we train seven supervised learning algorithms to recognise innovative firms on 2013 firmographics data and select a combination of those models with the best prediction power. Second, we apply the latter on the 2008 dataset and predict which firms would have been labelled as innovative according to the definition of the 2012 law. Finally, we adopt this new indicator as the regressor in a survival model to explain firms' ability to remain in the market after 2008. The results suggest that innovative firms are more likely to survive than the rest of the sample, but the survival premium is likely to depend on location. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",-1,10.1080/10438599.2020.1769810,"This paper utilizes machine learning algorithms to create a new measure of innovation based on a 2012 Italian law and analyzes its impact on the survival of firms during the 2008 crisis.

"This paper employs machine learning to quantify the value of “soft” information contained in real estate property descriptions. Textual descriptions contain information that traditional hedonic attributes cannot capture. A one standard deviation increase in the uniqueness of a property based on this “soft” information leads to a 15% increase in property sale price in a hedonic price model and a 10% increase in a repeat sales price model. The effects in the hedonic model appear to arise through two channels: the unobserved quality of the housing unit, and the market power of the housing unit relative to competing properties. The effects in the repeat sales model appear to be driven entirely by the market power of the unit. Further, an annual hedonic price index ignoring our measure of unobserved quality overstates real estate prices by between 10% to 23% and mistimes the stabilization of housing prices following the Great Recession.

"This research aims to substantiate the impact of using open innovation (OI) in the energy sector in readiness to implement artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and their effectiveness. The empirical method was proposed to determine the readiness level of OI for the implementation of AI technologies by comparing Russian and French energy companies. Readiness level indicators of companies for AI implementation using the Fibonacci sequence, Student’s t-test, and the method of fuzzy sets were empirically determined. The integrated readiness indicator for AI implementation by companies was calculated using the method of fuzzy sets and expressed through variance, allowing for these significant factors. Russian companies are at a low level of developmental readiness to implement AI, which is in contrast to companies operating in a developed market where the determining factor is the AI technology cost. The example of the innovative business model “Energy-as-a-Service” shows the synergistic effects of OI use and AI technology introduction.

"This paper seeks to examine the potential influences AI may have on the right to a fair trial when it is used in the courtroom. Essentially, AI systems can assume two roles in the courtroom. On the one hand, ""AI assistants""can support judges in their decision-making process by predicting and preparing judicial decisions; on the other hand, ""robot judges""can replace human judges and decide cases autonomously in fully automated court proceedings. Both roles will be tested against the requirements of the right to a fair trial as protected by Article 6 ECHR. An important element in this test is the role that a human judge plays in legal proceedings. As the justice system is a social process, the AI assistant is preferred to a situation in which a robot judge would completely replace human judges.

"Abstract: Could the forced digitalization of multiple spheres of human life caused by the coronavirus pandemic lead to radical changes in the global and Russian economies? How and to what extent have ubiquitous lockdowns affected the digital transformation? The new model of the digital economy growth, formed during the ongoing crisis, actually contributes to the accelerated development of secondary digital infrastructure (platforms and artificial intelligence technologies) through the creation of mass markets, the noticeably higher consumption in the field of ICT services, and the redistribution of a significant part of resources from other sectors. However, this digital forcing, within the framework of which traditional industries were placed in a deliberately losing situation due to artificially created circumstances, is taking place during a fundamental structural crisis of the global economy. Therefore, unlike the technological revolutions of the past, this one will have serious objective limitations associated with narrowed opportunities for the development of the primary digital infrastructure, without which extensive development of digital services and markets is impossible. In addition, further implementation of the adopted model of building a digital economy, based on the collection and processing of big data, is fundamentally impossible outside globalization processes and implies a significant imbalance between the new “world technological center” (the United States and China, who, however, are in a state of trade war) and the “world technological periphery.” For most other countries, including Russia, it means the need to “fit” into one of the two currently possible peripheral contours of the global digital transformation. © 2021, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",-1,10.1134/S1075700721010056,"This paper examines the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on digital transformation in global and Russian economies, focusing on the accelerated development of digital infrastructure and AI technologies.

However, to the best of our knowledge, no study has yet been undertaken on measures of FI and the nexus between FI and bank market structure in Africa. We used panel data from 17 African countries from 2004 to 2018 to measure FI and examine its nexus with bank market structure in these countries. We employed two-stage unsupervised machine learning to index FI: its dimensions in the first stage and overall FI in the second stage. Then, we employed an endogenous panel threshold model to examine bank market power and asset concentration impacts on FI. We found that bank market power enhances availability and accessibility dimensions but reduces the usage dimension. The impact of a higher regime market power on usage is worse than that of a lower regime market power. Asset concentration impacts on overall FI, availability, and usage are more pronounced under a lower regime concentration. The results imply that bank asset concentration and market power beyond thresholds are not desirable for promoting FI.

"Artificial Intelligence is poised to transform all facets of marketing. In this study, we examine the link between firms’ focus on AI in their 10-K reports and their gross and net operating efficiency. 10-K reports are a salient source of insight into an array of issues in accounting and finance research, yet remain relatively overlooked in marketing. Drawing upon economic and marketing theory, we develop a guiding framework to show how firms’ AI focus could be related to gross and net operating efficiency. We then use a system of simultaneous equations to empirically test the relationship between AI focus and operating efficiency. Our findings confirm that US-listed firms are in a state of impending transformation with regards to AI.

"The article concerns the problem of technological unemployment in the perspective of industry 4.0 development. The purpose of the article is to indicate the positive and negative effects of industry 4.0 development and to define the ways of programming education as a way to counteract the negative effects of industry 4.0 development. The author emphasizes the need for an appropriate education curriculum, aimed at acquiring both professional and engineering competences as well as humanistic, ethical and social competences at the same time. Technological unemployment is defined as a temporary, short-term phenomenon, lasting until human capital is shifted to other applications. The lack of adequate education, including lifelong learning, creates a risk of transition from technological unemployment to structural unemployment, which is much more dangerous for economic and social reasons. The article, therefore, contains an analysis of the labor market in terms of the demand for specific competences in the perspective of industry 4.0 development and forecasts of the demand for competences of the future. There is no doubt that the development of industry 4.0 requires specialized competences combining the skills of an IT specialist and an automation / robotics specialist who has skills in the field of cyber-physical systems integration, operation of advanced production management systems and complex production data analysis systems as well as the application of artificial intelligence algorithms in the production space.

"The increasing workplace use of artificially intelligent (AI) technologies has implications for the experience of meaningful human work. Meaningful work refers to the perception that one’s work has worth, significance, or a higher purpose. The development and organisational deployment of AI is accelerating, but the ways in which this will support or diminish opportunities for meaningful work and the ethical implications of these changes remain under-explored. This conceptual paper is positioned at the intersection of the meaningful work and ethical AI literatures and offers a detailed assessment of the ways in which the deployment of AI can enhance or diminish employees’ experiences of meaningful work. We first outline the nature of meaningful work and draw on philosophical and business ethics accounts to establish its ethical importance. We then explore the impacts of three paths of AI deployment (replacing some tasks, ‘tending the machine’, and amplifying human skills) across five dimensions constituting a holistic account of meaningful work, and finally assess the ethical implications. In doing so we help to contextualise the meaningful work literature for the era of AI, extend the ethical AI literature into the workplace, and conclude with a range of practical implications and future research directions. © 2023, The Author(s).",-1,10.1007/s10551-023-05339-7,"This conceptual paper examines the implications of AI deployment on meaningful work, assessing how AI can enhance or diminish employees' experiences.

"Exploiting an innovative measure of corporate integrity based on machine learning and textual analysis, this paper explores the effect of hostile takeover exposure on corporate integrity. Using a measure of takeover vulnerability principally based on state legislation, we find that a more active takeover market raises corporate integrity, corroborating the notion that the disciplinary mechanism associated with the takeover market induces managers to enhance corporate integrity. Specifically, a rise in takeover exposure by one standard deviation results in an improvement in integrity by 4.00%.

"For the last 30 years, the economy has been undergoing a massive digital transformation. Intangible digital assets, like software solutions, Web services, and more recently deep learning algorithms, artificial intelligence, and digital platforms, have been increasingly adopted thanks to the diffusion and advancements of information and communication technologies. Various observers argue that we could rapidly approach a technological singularity leading to explosive economic growth. The contribution of this paper is on the empirical and the modelling sides. On the empirical side, we present a cross-country empirical analysis assessing the correlation between the growth rate of both tangible and intangible investments and different measures of productivity growth. Results show a significant correlation between intangible investments and both labor and total factor productivity in the period after the 2008 financial crisis. Similarly, both measures of productivity growth are correlated with a combination of both tangible and intangible investments which include information and communication technologies and software and database.

"Based on a data set of 91 papers and 22 industry studies, we analyse the impact of artificial intelligence on the insurance sector using Porter’s (1985) value chain and Berliner’s (1982) insurability criteria. Additionally, we present future research directions, from both the academic and practitioner points of view. The results illustrate that both cost efficiencies and new revenue streams can be realised, as the insurance business model will shift from loss compensation to loss prediction and prevention. Moreover, we identify two possible developments with respect to the insurability of risks. The first is that the application of artificial intelligence by insurance companies might allow for a more accurate prediction of loss probabilities, thus reducing one of the industry’s most inherent problems, namely asymmetric information. The second development is that artificial intelligence might change the risk landscape significantly by transforming some risks from low-severity/high-frequency to high-severity/low-frequency.

"The goals of ending extreme poverty by 2030 and working towards a more equal distribution of incomes are part of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals. Using data from 166 countries comprising 97.5% of the world’s population, we simulate scenarios for global poverty from 2019 to 2030 under various assumptions about growth and inequality. We use different assumptions about growth incidence curves to model changes in inequality, and rely on a machine-learning algorithm called model-based recursive partitioning to model how growth in GDP is passed through to growth as observed in household surveys. When holding within-country inequality unchanged and letting GDP per capita grow according to World Bank forecasts and historically observed growth rates, our simulations suggest that the number of extreme poor (living on less than $1.90/day) will remain above 600 million in 2030, resulting in a global extreme poverty rate of 7.4%. If the Gini index in each country decreases by 1% per year, the global poverty rate could reduce to around 6.3% in 2030, equivalent to 89 million fewer people living in extreme poverty. Reducing each country’s Gini index by 1% per year has a larger impact on global poverty than increasing each country’s annual growth 1 percentage point above forecasts. We also study the impact of COVID-19 on poverty and find that the pandemic may have driven around 60 million people into extreme poverty in 2020.

"This article investigates the value of business format franchising and how it is changing in response to a large increase in consumer information provided by online reputation mechanisms. Theory has suggested that much of the value of chain affiliation to firms comes from the ability of chain partners to use the same name, imagery, logo, and marketing to create a common brand reputation and signal specific qualities in settings with asymmetric information between buyers and sellers. As more information becomes available, consumers should rely less on branding for quality signals, and firms’ ability to extend reputations across heterogeneous outlets should decrease. To examine this empirically, the author combines a large panel of hotel revenues with millions of online reviews from multiple platforms. Chain-affiliated hotels earn substantially higher revenues than equivalent independent hotels, but this premium has declined by over 50% from 2000 to 2015. This can be largely attributed to an increase in online reputation mechanisms, and this effect is largest for low-quality and small-market firms. Measures of the information content of online reviews show that as information has increased, independent hotel revenue has grown substantially more than chain hotel revenue. This result should be viewed as descriptive, with attempts to come to near causality including the use of machine learning to derive latent dimensions of firm quality from the text of online reviews.

Findings: The results show a positive relationship between the digital transformation index and economic development, labor productivity and job employment. Females seem to gain more from digital transformation compared to males, as suggested by the positive relation with the first and the insignificant relation with the latter. The relationship with vulnerable employment is not significant; more evidence is still needed to judge whether digital transformation will have an impact upon the vulnerable employees in the economy. Research limitations/implications: The paper focused on the impact of digital transformation upon total aggregate employment. Future research is still needed to examine the impact upon the structure of the labor market and the shift of occupations. Originality/value: The paper aims to add to in the literature regarding the relationship between digital transformation, economic development, employment and productivity in the developing world. The implications of those relationships are of significant importance to policymakers regarding how much support should be given to encourage the digital transformation. At the same time, it shall also indicate how much social support policies are required – if any – to lessen the negative impact of digital transformation on the vulnerable groups inside the country. Another contribution is using a single composite index for digital transformation that is comparable across the chosen set of developing countries, instead of using single indices each capturing a different dimension of digital transformation. © 2020, Heidi Aly.",-1,10.1108/REPS-11-2019-0145,"This paper examines the relationship between digital transformation (including AI trends) and economic development, labor productivity, and employment in developing countries.

"Artificial intelligence (AI) continues to transform firm-customer interactions. However, current AI marketing agents are often perceived as cold and uncaring and can be poor substitutes for human-based interactions. Addressing this issue, this article argues that artificial empathy needs to become an important design consideration in the next generation of AI marketing applications. Drawing from research in diverse disciplines, we develop a systematic framework for integrating artificial empathy into AI-enabled marketing interactions. We elaborate on the key components of artificial empathy and how each component can be implemented in AI marketing agents. We further explicate and test how artificial empathy generates value for both customers and firms by bridging the AI-human gap in affective and social customer experience. Recognizing that artificial empathy may not always be desirable or relevant, we identify the requirements for artificial empathy to create value and deduce situations where it is unnecessary and, in some cases, harmful. © 2022, The Author(s).",-1,10.1007/s11747-022-00892-5,"This paper focuses on integrating artificial empathy into AI marketing applications to enhance firm-customer interactions.

"The scientific literature peer review workflow is under strain because of the constant growth of submission volume. One response to this is to make initial screening of submissions less time intensive. Reducing screening and review time would save millions of working hours and potentially boost academic productivity. Many platforms have already started to use automated screening tools, to prevent plagiarism and failure to respect format requirements. Some tools even attempt to flag the quality of a study or summarise its content, to reduce reviewers’ load. The recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) create the potential for (semi) automated peer review systems, where potentially low-quality or controversial studies could be flagged, and reviewer-document matching could be performed in an automated manner. However, there are ethical concerns, which arise from such approaches, particularly associated with bias and the extent to which AI systems may replicate bias. Our main goal in this study is to discuss the potential, pitfalls, and uncertainties of the use of AI to approximate or assist human decisions in the quality assurance and peer-review process associated with research outputs. We design an AI tool and train it with 3300 papers from three conferences, together with their reviews evaluations. We then test the ability of the AI in predicting the review score of a new, unobserved manuscript, only using its textual content. We show that such techniques can reveal correlations between the decision process and other quality proxy measures, uncovering potential biases of the review process. Finally, we discuss the opportunities, but also the potential unintended consequences of these techniques in terms of algorithmic bias and ethical concerns. © 2021, The Author(s).",-1,10.1057/s41599-020-00703-8,"This paper discusses the use of AI in the peer review process, focusing on its potential to automate initial screening and predict review scores based on manuscript content.

First, in addition to subsidies and intellectual property (IP) policy that will influence the diffusion of AI in ways similar to their effect on other technologies, three policy categories—privacy, trade, and liability—may be uniquely salient in their influence on the diffusion patterns of AI.

"Effects of digital transformation on value creation, productivity, and innovation have been previously examined. However, only a few studies have explored how the capital market responds to firms' digitalization, and the relationship between digital transformation and stock price crash risk has remained unknown. The current study explores this gap by using data of listed firms in China in 2007–2020. We create a Chinese dictionary containing digital keywords by using the deep learning model, and set the proportion of intangible assets related to digital keywords as proxy for digital transformation. Findings show that digital transformation significantly reduces stock price crash risk. Moreover, results remain robust after addressing endogeneity problems and several robustness tests. Heterogeneity analysis suggests that the attenuation effect of digital transformation on stock price crash risk is strong for firms that are small, with low analyst attention, in the tech industries, and in areas with high trust. This study validates two potential mechanisms, namely, information and internal control channels. Lastly, digital transformation significantly reduces opacity and increases internal control quality. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",-1,10.1016/j.irfa.2022.102196,This paper examines the relationship between digital transformation and stock price crash risk using data from Chinese listed firms.

"Based on recent developments in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), we examine what type of human labor will be a substitute versus a complement to emerging technologies. We argue that these recent developments reduce the costs of providing a particular set of tasks – prediction tasks. Prediction about uncertain states of the world is an input into decision-making. We show that prediction allows riskier decisions to be taken and this is its impact on observed productivity although it could also increase the variance of outcomes as well. We consider the role of human judgment in decision-making as prediction technology improves. Judgment is exercised when the objective function for a particular set of decisions cannot be described (i.e., coded). However, we demonstrate that better prediction impacts the returns to different types of judgment in opposite ways. Hence, not all human judgment will be a complement to AI. Finally, we show that humans will delegate some decisions to machines even when the decision would be superior with human input. © 2019",-1,10.1016/j.infoecopol.2019.05.001,"This paper analyzes the relationship between AI and human labor, specifically focusing on how AI affects prediction tasks and decision-making.

"Artificial intelligence (AI) in the context of customer service, we define as a technology-enabled system for evaluating real-time service scenarios using data collected from digital and/or physical sources in order to provide personalised recommendations, alternatives, and solutions to customers’ enquiries or problems, even very complex ones. We examined, in a banking services context, whether consumers preferred AI or Human online customer service applications using an experimental design across three field-based experiments. The results show that, in the case of low-complexity tasks, consumers considered the problem-solving ability of AI to be greater than that of human customer service and were more likely to use AI while, conversely, for high-complexity tasks, they viewed human customer service as superior and were more likely to use it than AI. Moreover, we found that perceived problem-solving ability mediated the effects of customers’ service usage intentions (i.e., their preference for AI vs. Human) with task complexity serving as a boundary condition.

"Companies in a variety of sectors are increasingly managing customer churn proactively, generally by detecting customers at the highest risk of churning and targeting retention efforts towards them. While there is a vast literature on developing churn prediction models that identify customers at the highest risk of churning, no research has investigated whether it is indeed optimal to target those individuals. Combining two field experiments with machine learning techniques, the author demonstrates that customers identified as having the highest risk of churning are not necessarily the best targets for proactive churn programs. This finding is not only contrary to common wisdom but also suggests that retention programs are sometimes futile not because firms offer the wrong incentives but because they do not apply the right targeting rules. Accordingly, firms should focus their modeling efforts on identifying the observed heterogeneity in response to the intervention and to target customers on the basis of their sensitivity to the intervention, regardless of their risk of churning. This approach is empirically demonstrated to be significantly more effective than the standard practice of targeting customers with the highest risk of churning. More broadly, the author encourages firms and researchers using randomized trials (or A/B tests) to look beyond the average effect of interventions and leverage the observed heterogeneity in customers' response to select customer targets. © 2018, American Marketing Association.",-1,10.1509/jmr.16.0163,"This paper examines the effectiveness of targeting customers at high risk of churn using machine learning and field experiments.

"The rush to understand new socio-economic contexts created by the wide adoption of AI is justified by its far-ranging consequences, spanning almost every walk of life. Yet, the public sector's predicament is a tragic double bind: its obligations to protect citizens from potential algorithmic harms are at odds with the temptation to increase its own efficiency - or in other words - to govern algorithms, while governing by algorithms. Whether such dual role is even possible, has been a matter of debate, the challenge stemming from algorithms' intrinsic properties, that make them distinct from other digital solutions, long embraced by the governments, create externalities that rule-based programming lacks. As the pressures to deploy automated decision making systems in the public sector become prevalent, this paper aims to examine how the use of AI in the public sector in relation to existing data governance regimes and national regulatory practices can be intensifying existing power asymmetries. To this end, investigating the legal and policy instruments associated with the use of AI for strenghtening the immigration process control system in Canada; “optimising” the employment services” in Poland, and personalising the digital service experience in Finland, the paper advocates for the need of a common framework to evaluate the potential impact of the use of AI in the public sector. In this regard, it discusses the specific effects of automated decision support systems on public services and the growing expectations for governments to play a more prevalent role in the digital society and to ensure that the potential of technology is harnessed, while negative effects are controlled and possibly avoided.

"Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing healthcare, but little is known about consumer receptivity to AI in medicine. Consumers are reluctant to utilize healthcare provided by AI in real and hypothetical choices, separate and joint evaluations. Consumers are less likely to utilize healthcare (study 1), exhibit lower reservation prices for healthcare (study 2), are less sensitive to differences in provider performance (studies 3A-3C), and derive negative utility if a provider is automated rather than human (study 4). Uniqueness neglect, a concern that AI providers are less able than human providers to account for consumers' unique characteristics and circumstances, drives consumer resistance to medical AI. Indeed, resistance to medical AI is stronger for consumers who perceive themselves to be more unique (study 5). Uniqueness neglect mediates resistance to medical AI (study 6), and is eliminated when AI provides care (a) that is framed as personalized (study 7), (b) to consumers other than the self (study 8), or (c) that only supports, rather than replaces, a decision made by a human healthcare provider (study 9).

"Corporate bankruptcy prediction is a long-standing topic of interest for a variety of stakeholders. Various prediction methodologies have been proposed to achieve more accurate predictions. So far, most studies have focused on making predictions using artificial intelligence models fed with accounting information only or a combination of accounting information and other category or categories of information.

Addressing these limitations, this paper presents VegaEdge, an AI framework optimized for edge-IoT devices capable of real-time vehicle detection and tracking, trajectory forecasting, and identifying anomalous driving behaviors, such as road departures, sudden stops, and hazardous merges. A novel lightweight anomaly detection algorithm based on trajectory prediction is used for identifying hazardous driving on highways. VegaEdge demonstrates its versatility and efficiency across various traffic conditions and roadway configurations and has been evaluated on platforms like the Nvidia Jetson Orin and Xavier NX. The Nvidia Jetson Orin processes up to 738 trajectories per second and detects up to 140 vehicles in a single frame. Additionally, the Carolinas Anomaly Dataset (CAD) an extension of the Carolinas Highway Dataset (CHD) is introduced. While CHD consists of standard highway vehicle videos and trajectories, CAD includes video data of anomalous driving behaviors, providing a crucial resource for enhancing anomaly detection algorithms. CAD is available at https://github.com/TeCSAR-UNCC/Carolinas_Dataset#chd-anomaly-test-set. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",-1,10.1016/j.iot.2024.101268,"This paper presents VegaEdge, an AI framework designed for real-time vehicle detection and tracking on edge-IoT devices, addressing limitations of traditional highway safety solutions.

"One of the key challenges for innovative companies is reducing innovation failures and the loss of scarce resources. This study investigates two under-explored aspects of innovation failure: training for innovative activities and public support for innovation. It uses data from five waves of the Community Innovation Survey (2008–2018) on more than 29,000 firms in seven emerging European innovation systems known for their weak innovation capacity, information asymmetries, and systemic failures, which increase the risk of innovation failure.

"Numerous studies have affirmed that artificial intelligence (AI) can effectively enable energy savings in factories. However, there is currently a lack of explicit research that identifies the energy-saving effects of AI methods as compared to the conventional practices employed in factories, which involve the replacement of equipment with high energy efficiency (non-AI method), with respect to variance in the effectiveness. Thus, this ignited the motivation for this study, wherein the research team developed a “Universal AI workflow for energy saving” which adopted a standard workflow of “learning, Modeling, and Prediction.” Additionally, a three-year research project was launched to conduct empirical tests in ten factories, comparing the efficacy differences between AI and Non-AI methods. In 2021, research team established the energy consumption baselines for each factory through data collection; the entirety of 2022 was dedicated to AI integrations; and energy-saving benefits were evaluated in 2023. During the research period, each factory also implemented other non-AI energy-saving methods which were juxtaposed with AI approaches for comparison. Our study results showed that average AI-enabled energy savings across the ten factories amounted to 106,124 kWh/yr, while average energy savings from non-AI methods amounted to 1,231,625 kWh/yr. Despite the inferior energy-saving results, the AI methods had an average return on investment (ROI) of 0.46 years while non-AI methods had an average ROI of 6.22 years, indicating that AI methods could recover the investment costs through energy savings in less than one year. It is also worth noting that the ten factories produced a diverse range of products encompassing wafers, steel, and foods, but the AI methods used for energy saving employed the same workflow. By contrast, the non-AI methods necessitated distinct workflows and detailed engineering adjustments. It can be inferred from these empirical findings that AI techniques for achieving energy-saving control in factories can be integrated using standardized processes. In summary, AI methods can facilitate standardized workflows in factories and offer substantial energy-saving benefits that can typically cover investments within a year. AI represents a highly viable energy conservation option for factories seeking to maintain uniformity in product processes and realize efficient ROIs. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",-1,10.1016/j.jclepro.2024.143049,"This study compares the energy-saving effects of AI methods against conventional non-AI practices in factories through empirical tests across ten factories.

"Data flows across organizational boundaries are vital for creating and capturing value from data-intensive digital technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence. To achieve this, organizations increasingly engage in digital innovation networks, i.e., constellations of relations among dispersed, loosely coupled actors, who seek to collaborate for combining heterogeneously distributed domain expertise to train and leverage emerging digital technologies that learn from data. Yet, data flows remain stalled within digital innovation networks, and organizations fail to achieve sought-after benefits from data-intensive digital technologies. To date, research has paid limited attention to what contributes to stalled data flows and what strategies are required to facilitate seamless data flows.

"The public discourse concerning the level of (dis)trust in ChatGPT and other applications based on large language models (LLMs) is loaded with generic, dread risk terms, while the heterogeneity of relevant theoretical concepts and empirical measurements of trust further impedes in-depth analysis. Thus, a more nuanced understanding of the factors driving the trust judgment call is essential to avoid unwarranted trust. In this commentary paper, we propose that addressing the notion of trust in consumer-facing LLM-based systems across the insurance industry can confer enhanced specificity to this debate. The concept and role of trust are germane to this particular setting due to the highly intangible nature of the product coupled with elevated levels of risk, complexity, and information asymmetry. Moreover, widespread use of LLMs in this sector is to be expected, given the vast array of text documents, particularly general policy conditions or claims protocols. Insurance as a practice is highly relevant to the welfare of citizens and has numerous spillover effects on wider public policy areas. We therefore argue that a domain-specific approach to good AI governance is essential to avoid negative externalities around financial inclusion. Indeed, as a constitutive element of trust, vulnerability is particularly challenging within this high-stakes set of transactions, with the adoption of LLMs adding to the socio-ethical risks. In light of this, our commentary provides a valuable baseline to support regulators and policymakers in unravelling the profound socioeconomic consequences that may arise from adopting consumer-facing LLMs in insurance. © 2024 The Authors",-1,10.1016/j.techsoc.2024.102644,"This commentary paper discusses the trust issues related to consumer-facing large language models (LLMs) in the insurance industry.

"While increasing homeownership has been a focal point for policymakers in the United States, the distribution of access to homeownership opportunities across all families within the country has not been equitable. The complex relation between social factors and economic conditions has significantly shaped the journey toward homeownership. Of particular concern is the persistent disparity in homeownership rates among Black households in the United States. Effectively addressing these disparities within urban communities necessitates comprehensive policy interventions and social initiatives. However, the success of such endeavors hinges upon a comprehensive grasp of the underlying causes of these inequalities. Drawing upon machine learning techniques, our analysis of national American Housing Survey data reveals clear evidence for the multifaceted and socio-demographic nature of racial disparities in homeownership within the United States. Our findings provide evidence for two previously obscured patterns. First, we observe that race-related risk factors, separate from household characteristics, are heterogeneous, not uniformly affecting all households. Specifically, our analysis highlights: (1) there is a geographical variations in how race-related risk factors contribute to racial inequality, and (2) households with lower educational attainment are potentially at increased risk of discrimination. Second, our findings underscore the potential of policies and social programs aimed at enhancing educational attainment to bridge the racial gap through two mechanisms: (i) mitigating vulnerability by alleviating race-related risk factors, and (ii) suppressing the compounding effects of racial disparities. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",-1,10.1016/j.cities.2024.105181,"This paper uses machine learning techniques to analyze national housing survey data, focusing on racial disparities in homeownership, particularly among Black households.

"Research Summary: We investigate how worker mobility influences the adoption of a new technology using state-level changes to the enforceability of noncompete agreements as an exogenous shock to worker mobility. Using data on over 153,000 establishments from 2010 and 2018, we find that changes that facilitate worker movements are associated with a significant decline in the likelihood of adoption of machine learning. Moreover, we find that the magnitude of decline depends upon the size of the establishment, the extent of predictive analytics adoption in its industry, and the number of large establishments in the same industry-location. These results are consistent with the view that increases in outward worker mobility increase costs for adoption of a new technology that involves significant downstream investments in the early years of its diffusion. Managerial Summary: Successful business adoption of new technologies such as machine learning requires skilled workers with experience in implementing those technologies. In the early years of technology diffusion workers in early adopting businesses typically acquire these skills through on-the-job learning that is paid for by the adopter. So, if such early adopters face an increased risk of those skilled workers quitting, then their incentives to adopt the technology decrease. We examine this possibility using changes in noncompete enforceability as a proxy for changes in worker mobility and find that the likelihood of adopting machine learning decreases as the risk of worker mobility increases, particularly for larger establishments, establishments in industries where adoption may be more beneficial and in locations with many large competing establishments. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",-1,10.1002/smj.3595,"This paper examines how worker mobility affects the adoption of machine learning technologies, using changes in noncompete agreements as an exogenous shock.

"Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly capable of providing users with advice in a wide range of professional domains, including legal advice. However, relying on LLMs for legal queries raises concerns due to the significant expertise required and the potential real-world consequences of the advice. To explore when and why LLMs should or should not provide advice to users, we conducted workshops with 20 legal experts using methods inspired by case-based reasoning. The provided realistic queries (""cases"") allowed experts to examine granular, situation-specific concerns and overarching technical and legal constraints, producing a concrete set of contextual considerations for LLM developers. By synthesizing the factors that impacted LLM response appropriateness, we present a 4-dimension framework: (1) User attributes and behaviors, (2) Nature of queries, (3) AI capabilities, and (4) Social impacts. We share experts' recommendations for LLM response strategies, which center around helping users identify 'right questions to ask' and relevant information rather than providing definitive legal judgments. Our findings reveal novel legal considerations, such as unauthorized practice of law, confidentiality, and liability for inaccurate advice, that have been overlooked in the literature. The case-based deliberation method enabled us to elicit fine-grained, practice-informed insights that surpass those from de-contextualized surveys or speculative principles. These findings underscore the applicability of our method for translating domain-specific professional knowledge and practices into policies that can guide LLM behavior in a more responsible direction.  © 2024 Owner/Author.",-1,10.1145/3630106.3659048,"This paper examines the appropriateness of legal advice provided by large language models (LLMs) through workshops with legal experts.

"Modern advances in AI have increased employer interest in tracking workers' biometric signals - e.g., their brainwaves and facial expressions - to evaluate and make predictions about their performance and productivity. These technologies afford managers information about internal emotional and physiological states that were previously accessible only to individual workers, raising new concerns around worker privacy and autonomy. Yet, the research literature on the impact of AI-powered biometric work monitoring (AI-BWM) technologies on workers remains fragmented across disciplines and industry sectors, limiting our understanding of its impacts on workers at large. In this paper, we sytematically review 129 papers, spanning varied disciplines and industry sectors, that discuss and analyze the impact of AI-powered biometric monitoring technologies in occupational settings. We situate this literature across a process model that spans the development, deployment, and usage phases of these technologies. We further draw on Shelby et al.'s Taxonomy of Socio-technical Harms in AI systems to systematize the harms experienced by workers across the three phases of our process model. We find that the development, deployment, and sustained use of AI-powered biometric work monitoring technologies put workers at risk of a number of the socio-technical harms specified by Shelby et al.: e.g., by forcing workers to exert additional emotional labor to avoid flagging unreliable affect monitoring systems, or through the use of these data to make inferences about productivity.

"As Generative AI rises in adoption, its use has expanded to include domains such as hiring and recruiting. However, without examining the potential of bias, this may negatively impact marginalized populations, including people with disabilities. To address this important concern, we present a resume audit study, in which we ask ChatGPT (specifically, GPT-4) to rank a resume against the same resume enhanced with an additional leadership award, scholarship, panel presentation, and membership that are disability-related. We find that GPT-4 exhibits prejudice towards these enhanced CVs. Further, we show that this prejudice can be quantifiably reduced by training a custom GPTs on principles of DEI and disability justice. Our study also includes a unique qualitative analysis of the types of direct and indirect ableism GPT-4 uses to justify its biased decisions and suggest directions for additional bias mitigation work.

"The introduction of AI into working processes has resulted in workers increasingly being subject to AI-related harms. By analyzing incidents of worker-related AI harms between 2008 and 2023 in the AI Incident Database, we find that harms get addressed under considerably restricted scenarios. Results from a Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) show that workers with more power resources, either in the form of expertise or labor market power, have a greater likelihood of seeing harms fixed, all else equal. By contrast, workers lacking expertise or labor market power, have lower success rates and must resort to legal or regulatory mechanisms to get fixes through.

"Organisations generate vast amounts of information, which has resulted in a long-term research effort into knowledge access systems for enterprise settings. Recent developments in artificial intelligence, in relation to large language models, are poised to have significant impact on knowledge access. This has the potential to shape the workplace and knowledge in new and unanticipated ways. Many risks can arise from the deployment of these types of AI systems, due to interactions between the technical system and organisational power dynamics. This paper presents the Consequences-Mechanisms-Risks framework to identify risks to workers from AI-mediated enterprise knowledge access systems. We have drawn on wide-ranging literature detailing risks to workers, and categorised risks as being to worker value, power, and wellbeing. The contribution of our framework is to additionally consider (i) the consequences of these systems that are of moral import: commodification, appropriation, concentration of power, and marginalisation, and (ii) the mechanisms, which represent how these consequences may take effect in the system. The mechanisms are a means of contextualising risk within specific system processes, which is critical for mitigation. This framework is aimed at helping practitioners involved in the design and deployment of AI-mediated knowledge access systems to consider the risks introduced to workers, identify the precise system mechanisms that introduce those risks, and begin to approach mitigation.

"The Indian information technology (IT) sector is traditionally known for delivering IT and business process management (BPM) services to clients across the globe. To ensure the longevity of this client and service provider relationship, Indian IT organizations have made significant client-specific investments and actively engaged them in offshore development activities. One of the outcomes from such investments can be seen in terms of the very high maturity standards that Indian IT organizations currently exhibit in the context of IT–BPM service delivery. In recent times, these organizations are also undertaking offshore projects around emerging technologies. Such projects, especially those related to artificial intelligence (AI), are largely centred around the automation of client-focused BPM services. Given their relative nascency, such projects are primarily led by the AI research units that are rapidly diffusing across Indian IT organizations. In this study, we rely on a four-month-long ethnography to explore a client and vendor (or service-provider) relationship as manifested through one such AI research unit of an Indian IT organization situated in Bengaluru, India. Our objective from this study is to understand how these new offshore AI projects affect the longevity of the relationship between clients and the Indian IT service providers. Given the nature of emerging technology workflows, our findings indicate a tilt more towards meeting client-side expectations than that of vendors in these projects. We portend that this can potentially disrupt the longevity of the client–vendor relationship in the Indian IT services sector, and, therefore, both the clients and vendors must attend to the peculiarities of offshore emerging technology projects to mitigate such disruptions. © The Author(s) 2024.",-1,10.1177/02560909241254998,"This paper examines the impact of offshore AI projects on client-vendor relationships in the Indian IT sector through ethnographic research.

"Technological advances and the “zeitgeist” led to increased use of AI in HR Analytics. Using machine learning models in this field might be beneficial but requires some unique considerations in how organizations govern, assure, audit, and support the use of AI. While substantial work has been done on AI ethics, organizational implantation studies are rare and often anecdotal, particularly in HR. In this article, we would like to better understand the common ethical considerations and organizational responses for developing AI for HR use and how different organizations engage with them by comparing two case studies. This paper begins by reviewing AI ethical issues specific to HR and describes the common mitigation strategies proposed in the literature. After this introduction, case studies are illustrated, and the organizational responses in both cases are analyzed. The discussion section shows that although the organizations were aware of the AI ethics issues, their responses varied and depended on different governance and self-regulation mechanisms that might have impinged their ability to proactively engage with ethical issues. A second finding is that the organization used only a relatively small set of mitigation strategies proposed in the literature, and we propose several reasons for this.

"Building on the literature on the concept-product gap in new product development, we examine how FinTech SMEs are developing Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based innovations and which organisational or project factors best contribute to the acceleration of AI innovation. The empirical evidence collected from interviews with key stakeholders, practitioners’ forums, and public company documents yields two distinct approaches that differ in their potential for accelerating innovation and reducing the concept-product gap. From a contingency perspective, these two approaches are expanded into four distinct development process configurations, contingent on the business development stage, reliance on 3rd party platforms, availability of high volumes of data, investment level, organisational agility, and level of novelty. The resulting process typology could be used as a diagnostic tool for FinTech SMEs interested in effectively leveraging AI innovation. Using contingency theory, we further develop these insights into a new theoretical framework to explain how AI innovation development unfolds in FinTech SMEs and the rationale for different implementations. Our new process typology and theoretical model can help researchers investigate the mechanisms underlying technological innovation processes.

"Although the empowerment of technology is of great value to society, little is known about its downstream effects on consumers' decisions. This research draws on the expectation–confirmation theory and autonomy in artificial intelligence (AI) and investigates how AI (vs. autonomous choice) has detrimental effects on consumer outcomes, creating an autonomy-technology tension — i.e., the conflict arising from AI technology diminishing consumers' autonomy in their choices. Four studies using a mixed-method approach reveal that the use of AI recommendations in streaming platforms creates an autonomy-technology tension that reduces consumers' performance expectancy, thus lowering their satisfaction. However, such effects are contingent on the nature of the AI recommendations.

We provide examples of AI robots’ use for different purposes, differentiating between four 'accountability clusters': (1) professional norms, (2) business responsibility, (3) inter-institutional normativity, and (4) supra-territorial regulations cluster. We also discuss the CDR implications in different clusters. Ethical implications of using AI service robots and associated accountability challenges are relevant for a network of actors—from customers and designers to firms and the government. Implementation of the framework incorporates a range of internal and external stakeholders that firms need to consider. We also provide a CDR roadmap to incorporate a time perspective and to inform implementation efforts. © 2024 The Authors",-1,10.1016/j.orgdyn.2024.101041,"This paper examines the ethical implications and accountability of AI service robots in financial services, proposing a conceptual framework based on normative ethical theory.

"Purpose: The current study uses an advanced machine learning method and aims to investigate whether auditors perceive financial statements that are principles-based as less risky. More specifically, this study aims to explore the association between principles-based accounting standards and audit pricing and between principles-based accounting standards and the likelihood of receiving a going concern opinion. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses an advanced machine-learning method to understand the role of principles-based accounting standards in predicting audit fees and going concern opinion. The study also uses multiple regression models defining audit fees and the probability of receiving going concern opinion. The analyses are complemented by additional tests such as economic significance, firm fixed effects, propensity score matching, entropy balancing, change analysis, yearly regression results and controlling for managerial risk-taking incentives and governance variables. Findings: The paper provides empirical evidence that auditors charge less audit fees to clients whose financial statements are more principles-based. The finding suggests that auditors perceive financial statements that are principles-based less risky. The study also provides evidence that the probability of receiving a going-concern opinion reduces as firms rely more on principles-based standards. The finding further suggests that auditors discount the financial numbers supplied by the managers using rules-based standards. The study also reveals that the degree of reliance by a US firm on principles-based accounting standards has a negative impact on accounting conservatism, the risk of financial statement misstatement, accruals and the difficulty in predicting future earnings. This suggests potential mechanisms through which principles-based accounting standards influence auditors’ risk assessments. Research limitations/implications: The authors recognize the limitation of this study regarding the sample period. Prior studies compare rules vs principles-based standards by focusing on the differences between US generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and international financial reporting standards (IFRS) or pre- and post-IFRS adoption, which raises questions about differences in cross-country settings and institutional environment and other confounding factors such as transition costs. This study addresses these issues by comparing rules vs principles-based standards within the US GAAP setting. However, this limits the sample period to the year 2006 because the measure of the relative extent to which a US firm is reliant upon principles-based standards is available until 2006. Practical implications: The study has major public policy suggestions as it responds to the call by Jay Clayton and Mary Jo White, the former Chairs of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), to pursue high-quality, globally accepted accounting standards to ensure that investors continue to receive clear and reliable financial information globally. The study also recognizes the notable public policy implications, particularly in light of the current Chair of the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) Andreas Barckow’s recent public statement, which emphasizes the importance of principles-based standards and their ability to address sustainability concerns, including emerging risks such as climate change. Originality/value: The study has major public policy suggestions because it demonstrates the value of principles-based standards.

"Online labor markets and the humans that power them serve a critical role in the advancement of artificial intelligence and supervised machine learning via the creation of useful training datasets. The use of human effort in online labor markets is not enough, however, as a key factor is understanding the possible interventions that market operators can leverage to incentivize human effort among their labor force. We propose that platforms could implement mechanisms such as rewards or punishments at individual or group levels to incentivize real-effort and output. We apply our interventions using a collaborative image tagging experiment—a folksonomy—and the results provide interesting insights and nonobvious consequences. On average, interventions applied at the group level outperformed interventions applied at the individual level. Punishing the group provided the most controversial incentive strategy and provided a nonobvious significant improvement in effort. Rewarding or sanctioning an individual had similar effects on average, with both treatments leading to significant increases in effort post-intervention. In contrast to predictions, sanctioning appears to have significantly motivated those that were punished. Overall, the interventions applied in our real-effort collaborative image tagging experiment had a significant impact on behavior, which provides guidance for online labor market operators and the use of incentives in the creation of labeled machine learning training datasets. © 2024 University of Minnesota.

"Purpose: By examining the impact of product innovation on abnormal financial returns following the launch of new products, this study aims to test the explanatory power of a new compound measure of product innovativeness (Ganbaatar and Douglas, 2019). Design/methodology/approach: It is a longitudinal study in which the authors used the compound product innovativeness score (CPIS) for the first time to measure product innovativeness. The abnormal financial returns are estimated through the event study design, where four different models are used. Artificial neural network analysis is done to determine the impact of the CPIS on abnormal returns by utilising a hexic polynomial regression model. Findings: The authors find effect sizes that substantially exceed practically significant levels and that the CPIS explain 65% of the variance in the firm’s abnormal returns in market valuation. Moreover, new-to-the-market novelty predicts 83% of the variation, while new-to-the-firm (catch-up) innovation insignificantly impacts firm value. Research limitations/implications: This paper demonstrates how the CPIS, an objective and direct measure of product innovativeness, can be used to gain more insight into the innovation effect. Practical implications: Implications for the business practice of this study include the necessity of relentless innovation by firms in contested differentiated markets, particularly where technological advance is ongoing. Larger and mature firms must practice corporate entrepreneurship to renew their products on a continuous basis to avoid slipping backwards in their markets. Innovation leadership, rather than following the leader, is also important to increase competitive advantage, given the result that innovation followship does not produce abnormal financial returns. Originality/value: In this study, the authors focused on the effect of product innovativeness on firm performance. While the literature affirms a positive relationship between innovation and firm performance, the effect size of this relationship varies, due largely to the authors contend to simplistic measures of innovativeness. In this study, the authors adopt the relatively novel “compound” measure of product innovativeness (Ganbaatar and Douglas, 2019) to better encapsulate the nuances of both technical novelty and market novelty. This measure of product innovativeness is applicable to firms of all sizes but is more easily applied to entrepreneurial new ventures and SMEs, and it avoids the shortcomings of prior firm-level and subjective measures of innovativeness for both smaller and larger firms. Using a more effective analytical method (Artificial Neural Network), the authors investigated whether there is a “practically” significant effect size due to product innovation, which could be valuable for entrepreneurs in practice. The authors show that the CPIS measure can very effectively explain abnormalities in the stock market, exhibiting a moderate effect size and explaining 65% of the variation in abnormal returns. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",-1,10.1108/IJIS-10-2022-0206,"This paper examines the relationship between product innovation and abnormal financial returns using a compound measure of product innovativeness.

"Despite the growing impact of artificial intelligence (AI) in business, there is little research examining its effects on firm idiosyncratic risk (IR). This is an important issue for boards: as key conduits of firm–environment information flows via board interlock networks, traditional risk oversight functions are being increasingly augmented with strategic decision-making and communications. Accordingly, we explore how AI and board interlocks independently and interactively affect IR, focusing on the heterogeneity of the board's network ties. We hypothesize these effects within signalling theory, positing that a firm's AI exposure and board network will differentially affect market perceptions of risk contingent on their perceived cost and relative signal strength under different environmental conditions. We find that while AI and board network heterogeneity both favourably affect risk, operating in a high-AI industry while occupying a network position that spans industry boundaries mitigates these effects, leading to an increase in IR for firms in the most technologically advanced industries. Additional analyses of diversification corroborate these theoretical mechanisms: as a costly signal of competence across multiple domains, diversification enables firms to simultaneously engage with AI and diverse knowledge networks without market penalties.

We find that one-third of the sample firms did not employ any of the seven AI technologies. Over 50% of the remaining firms implemented one or two technologies only. Visual recognition, machine learning and natural written language processing were the most commonly implemented technologies. AI implementation was the highest in production and research and development compared to other functions. The main motivations for implementing AI were to enhance operational efficiency, improve defects detection and prediction, automate processes, and reduce labour hours/costs. Among the firms that implemented AI, improvements in operational efficiency were more frequently reported, followed by reductions in labour hours/costs and enhancements in product/process quality. Lack of business needs, suitability to the business, expertise in implementation, and confidence in generating significant benefits were the main reasons for not experimenting with AI technologies.

"Artificial intelligence (AI) and big data have the potential to promote advancement across various industries. Sport management and marketing have also significantly transformed due to rapid technological advances such as those in AI and big data analytics. Especially sports companies, however, are still underutilizing the potential of AI. At the same time, considering the existing sport marketing research, the effectiveness and optimization of dynamic marketing stimuli in dynamic sport media settings remains unclear. This study aims to assess the differences between two AI models’ predictive capabilities with and without access to consumers’ biometric data when forecasting the influence of game features on consumers’ responses. Academic theoretical models indicate that individual biometric features have a considerable influence on consumers’ responses; nevertheless, it remains impractical for companies to access these data concerning message effectiveness and ROI evaluation. Therefore, the study attempts to enhance the feasibility of message optimization for companies by trialing a real-time prediction derived from game features alone, exemplifying how much predictive capability is lost by non-available consumer data. Two supervised machine learning models (one initial, primarily theoretical based model; one adapted model due to available data) were trained to reanalyze large-scale eye tracking and game-related data, resulting in high predictive accuracy and appropriate applicability of the models. Both models were able to predict consumers’ responses with over 90% accuracy (initial model: 96%; adapted model: 94%). This study exemplifies AI usage in sport marketing and management, enabling companies to implement more effective marketing messages and strategies for their sponsorship based on real-time evaluation. © 2024 The Author(s).

"The irruption of large language models (LLMs) during the last year has prompted researchers and practitioners to explore novel scenarios for integrating LLMs, enhancing task execution efficiency across diverse domains. Among these, business process management (BPM) stands out as a fertile ground for leveraging LLM features. As organizations strive to streamline their processes throughout the BPM lifecycle, the potential benefits of incorporating LLMs become increasingly evident. In this sense, over the past year, several approaches have been proposed to incorporate LLMs in BPM-related tasks. Concurrently, research efforts have identified key research directions that can help guide the adoption of LLMs in the BPM lifecycle phases. In this article, we perform a comprehensive literature review to assess the impact and coverage of existing approaches in addressing these research directions. In addition, we deem it particularly relevant to analyze the evaluation criteria followed.

"Traditional agriculture has jeopardized national resources given the limited availability of natural resources. On the other hand, artificial intelligence (AI) has resulted in more efficient resource utilization. Nowadays, animal agriculture is much more sustainable with the help of artificial intelligence. Furthermore, the rate of AI maturity in animal agriculture provides a roadmap for optimizing its integration into it, which is of great concern to enterprise managers and policymakers. According to the literature, there is no AI maturity model in the animal agriculture sector to assess the latter. The current study was carried out in four phases. First, the literature shed light on the dimensions of AI and its applications in animal agriculture. Second, animal agricultural experts ranked the AI dimensions using the Best-Worst Method (BWM). In the third phase, a model was developed to assess AI maturity across all dimensions of AI technology and AI applications in animal agriculture. Finally, a company maturity assessment tested the proposed model by questionnaire. The research findings show that health monitoring is the most important AI application in animal agriculture.

"The examination of the associations between internal corporate governance (CG) mechanisms and innovation faces challenges due to nonlinear patterns and complex interactions. Consequently, existing literature rarely reaches a consensus on the directions or strengths of these relationships. Furthermore, to investigate the CG–innovation association, prior research has predominantly relied on explanatory modeling, which involves applying statistical models to data to test correlational or causal hypotheses about theoretical constructs. These are the reasons why it remains unclear whether internal CG mechanisms, when considered collectively as an extensive array of interconnected variables, offer valuable insights for accurately predicting innovation. To address this gap, we analyze a dataset of research and development (R&D) projects from the Brazilian electricity sector by employing predictive modeling, which entails using statistical models or data mining algorithms to predict new observations, particularly using supervised machine learning (ML) methods. Our study demonstrates that a comprehensive set of variables representing internal CG mechanisms significantly enhances the predictive capabilities of ML algorithms for innovation. Furthermore, we illustrate how ML can illuminate nonlinear and non-monotonic patterns, and interactions among variables, in the CG–innovation relationship. Our contribution to the literature encompasses three key aspects: introducing a predictive modeling approach to the discourse on the role of CG in innovation attainment through R&D endeavors, which can complement and enrich existing explanatory research; investigating non-linear and non-monotonic relationships, as well as interactions, in innovation prediction; and affirming the emerging body of literature that recognizes supervised ML as a valuable tool accessible to management researchers. © 2024 RADMA and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",-1,10.1111/radm.12703,"This paper analyzes the relationship between corporate governance mechanisms and innovation using predictive modeling and supervised machine learning methods on R&D data from the Brazilian electricity sector.

"Purpose: While different attempts have been made to use artificial intelligence (AI) to codify communicative behaviors and analyze startups’ video presentations in relation to crowdfunding projects, less is known about other forms of access to entrepreneurial finance, such as video pitches for candidacies into startup accelerators and incubators. This research seeks to demonstrate how AI can enable the startup selection process for both entrepreneurs and investors in terms of video pitch evaluation. Design/methodology/approach: An AI startup (Speechannel) was used to predict the outcomes of startup video presentations by analyzing text, audio, and video data from 294 video pitches sent to a leading European startup accelerator (LUISS EnLabs). 7 investors were also interviewed in Silicon Valley to establish the differences between humans and machines. Findings: This research proves that AI has profound implications with regards to the decision-making process related to fundraising and, in particular, the video pitches of startup accelerators and incubators. Successful entrepreneurs are confident (but not overconfident), engaging in terms of speaking quickly (but also clearly), and emotional (but not overemotional). Practical implications: This study not only fills the existing research gap but also provides a practical guide on AI-driven video pitch evaluation for entrepreneurs and investors, reshaping the landscape of entrepreneurial finance thanks to AI. On the one hand, entrepreneurs could use this knowledge to modify their behaviors, enabling them to increase their likelihood of being financially backed.

"Purpose: In the context of the journey toward digital transformation and the realization of a fully connected factory, concepts such as data science, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and even predictive models emerge as indispensable pillars. Given the relevance of these topics, the present study focused on the analysis of customer complaint data, employing ML techniques to anticipate complaint accountability. The primary objective was to enhance data accessibility, harnessing the potential of ML models to optimize the complaint handling process and thereby positively contribute to data-driven decision-making. This approach aimed not only to reduce the number of units to be analyzed and customer response time but also to underscore the pressing need for a paradigm shift in quality management. The application of AI techniques sought to enhance not only the efficiency of the complaint handling process and data accessibility but also to demonstrate how the integration of these innovative approaches could profoundly transform the way quality is conceived and managed within organizations. Design/methodology/approach: To conduct this study, real customer complaint data from an automotive company was utilized. Our main objective was to highlight the importance of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in the context of quality. To achieve this, we adopted a methodology consisting of 10 distinct phases: business analysis and understanding; project plan definition; sample definition; data exploration; data processing and pre-processing; feature selection; acquisition of predictive models; evaluation of the models; presentation of the results; and implementation. This methodology was adapted from data mining methodologies referenced in the literature, taking into account the specific reality of the company under study. This ensured that the obtained results were applicable and replicable across different fields, thereby strengthening the relevance and generalizability of our research findings. Findings: The achieved results not only demonstrated the ability of ML models to predict complaint accountability with an accuracy of 64%, but also underscored the significance of the adopted approach within the context of Quality 4.0 (Q4.0). This study served as a proof of concept in complaint analysis, enabling process automation and the development of a guide applicable across various areas of the company. The successful integration of AI techniques and Q4.0 principles highlighted the pressing need to apply concepts of digitization and artificial intelligence in quality management. Furthermore, it emphasized the critical importance of data, its organization, analysis and availability in driving digital transformation and enhancing operational efficiency across all company domains. In summary, this work not only showcased the advancements achieved through ML application but also emphasized the pivotal role of data and digitization in the ongoing evolution of Quality 4.0. Originality/value: This study presents a significant contribution by exploring complaint data within the organization, an area lacking investigation in real-world contexts, particularly focusing on practical applications. The development of standardized processes for data handling and the application of predictions for classification models not only demonstrated the viability of this approach but also provided a valuable proof of concept for the company. Most importantly, this work was designed to be replicable in other areas of the factory, serving as a fundamental basis for the company’s data scientists.

"Purpose: The increasing awareness and adoption of technology, particularly artificial intelligence (AI), reshapes industries and daily life, fostering a proactive approach to risk management and leveraging advanced analytics, which may affect the stock price crash risk (SPCR). The main objective of the current study is to explore how AI adoption influences SPCR. Design/methodology/approach: This study employs an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) fixed-effect regression model to explore the impact of AI on SPCR in Chinese A-share listed companies from 2010 to 2020. Further, number of robustness analysis (2SLS, PSM and Sys-GMM) and channel analysis are used to validate the findings. Findings: The primary findings emphasize that AI adoption significantly reduces SPCR likelihood. Further, channel analysis indicates that AI adoption enhances internal control quality, contributing to a reduction in firm SPCR. Additionally, the observed relationship is notably more pronounced in non-state-owned enterprises (non-SOEs) compared to state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Similarly, this distinction is heightened in nonforeign enterprises (non-FEs) as opposed to foreign enterprises (FEs). The study finding also supports the notion that financial analysts enhance transparency, reducing the SPCR. Moreover, the study results consistently align across different statistical methodologies, including 2SLS, PSM and Sys-GMM, employed to effectively address endogeneity concerns. Research limitations/implications: Our study stands out for its distinctive focus on the financial implications of AI adoption, particularly how it influences firm-level SPCR, an area that has been overlooked in previous research. Through the lens of information asymmetry theory, agency theory, and the economic implications of integrating AI into financial markets, our study makes a substantial contribution in mitigating SPCR.

"The integration of machine learning (ML), functioning as the core of various artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled systems in organizations, comes with the assertion that ML models offer automated decisions or assist domain experts in refining their decision-making. The current research presents substantial evidence of ML’s positive impact on business and organizational performance. Nonetheless, there is a limited understanding of how decision-makers participate in the process of generating ML-driven insights and enhancing their comprehension of business environments through ML outcomes. To enhance this engagement and understanding, this study examines the interactive process between decision-makers and ML experts as they strive to comprehend an environment and gather business insights for decision-making. It builds upon Weick’s sensemaking model by integrating ML’s pivotal role. By conducting interviews with 31 ML experts and ML end-users, we explore the dimsensions of sensemaking in the context of ML utilization for decision-making. Consequently, this study proposes a process model which advances the organizational ML research by operationalizing Weick’s work into a structured ML-driven sensemaking model. This model charts a pragmatic pathway, outlining the interaction sequence between decision-makers and ML tools as they navigate through recognizing and utilizing ML, exploring opportunities, assessing ML model outcomes, and translating ML models into action, thereby advancing both the theoretical framework and its practical deployment in organizational contexts. © (2024) authors.

"Automated chatbots powered by artificial intelligence (AI) can act as a ubiquitous point of contact, improving access to healthcare and empowering users to make effective decisions. However, despite the potential benefits, emerging literature suggests that apprehensions linked to the distinctive features of AI technology and the specific context of use (healthcare) could undermine consumer trust and hinder widespread adoption. Although the role of trust is considered pivotal to the acceptance of healthcare technologies, a dearth of research exists that focuses on the contextual factors that drive trust in such AI-based Chatbots for Self-Diagnosis (AICSD). Accordingly, a contextual model based on the trust-in-technology framework was developed to understand the determinants of consumers’ trust in AICSD and its behavioral consequences. It was validated using a free simulation experiment study in India (N = 202). Perceived anthropomorphism, perceived information quality, perceived explainability, disposition to trust technology, and perceived service quality influence consumers’ trust in AICSD. In turn, trust, privacy risk, health risk, and gender determine the intention to use.

This article investigates the effects of ML on perceived service quality (PSQ) across various customer service measures within an organizational context. Utilizing a quasiexperimental design, we analyzed 131 978 service requests submitted to the service desk of a large enterprise software organization. Over a 2-year period, these requests were made by 1252 organizations and were associated with 85 654 predictions and 19 720 returned PSQ postservice questionnaires. Our regularized logistic regression model aimed to categorize service requests into 56 categories and dispatch them into one of nine assignment groups to enhance resolution efficiency. Contrary to expectations, the overall PSQ did not significantly improve, while five specific metrics, such as time to resolve and first-time resolution, improved. This may be attributed to the increase in the first personal response time.

"Current approaches for identifying valuable content among the multitude of solutions in crowdsourcing contests are resource-intensive and constrained by human processing capacity. As idea convergence processes usually focus on filtering out single ideas, the potential of solution-related knowledge among the heterogeneous ideas is not exploited in a sustainable manner. Transformer-based language models can process large sets of idea descriptions into digestible structures, with unprecedented capabilities for understanding and manipulating text. This study explores how they can help organizations and decision-makers navigate crowdsourced solution spaces efficiently and comprehensively.

"In today fast-paced economy, businesses are continuously searching for innovative new ways to differentiate themselves from their rivals. The purpose of this study is to investigate the intersections between machine learning and corporate strategy, with a particular emphasis on the ways in which predictive analytics might be utilised to direct strategic expansion within existing markets. As marketplaces evolve, it is becoming increasingly necessary for businesses to accurately predict future market trends as well as the activities of their customers in order to achieve sustained success. Many conventional company tactics are unable to keep up with the ever-changing nature of today marketplaces because they are so dependent on the past and on tried-and-true ways of analysis. Finding a means to use predictive analytics as a guide for strategic planning that satisfies the market desire for speed and insight while at the same time meeting that demand might be challenging. Even while predictive analytics is widely recognised as a valuable resource, the process of methodically incorporating it into company strategy for the purpose of entering new markets is still mostly undiscovered. This study bridges a knowledge vacuum and provides a new viewpoint on the decision-making process within companies by proposing a holistic framework that integrates approaches for machine learning with strategic planning. The research exploits vast amounts of data and makes use of complex machine learning strategies in a two-pronged approach. The process of assessing market data, customer behaviour patterns, and other external variables from the past is what is referred to as training predictive models.

"The detection of bone fractures is critical for timely medical intervention and patient care. Traditional methods often rely on manual examination of medical images, leading to potential delays and inaccuracies. Leveraging advancements in computer vision, this study investigates the application of the You Only Look Once (YOLO) algorithm for automated bone fracture detection. The detection of humerus bone fractures is critical for orthopedic diagnosis and treatment planning, necessitating accurate and efficient identification to ensure timely clinical intervention. This study proposes a novel approach to humerus bone fracture detection using the You Only Look Once (YOLO) algorithm, a state-of-the-art object detection model in computer vision.

"In market-based economies often appear significant decreases of economic activity, which lead to recessionary economic crises. These economic crises have quite negative consequences for firms, as they lead to significant decrease of their sales revenues; firms respond by decreasing on one hand their production and in general operational activities and expenses, personnel employment and materials’ procurement, and on the other hand their investments in production equipment, digital technologies, etc., which leads to technological obsolescence. This reduction of investments, and especially of the ones in digital technologies, due to their importance for firms’ efficiency, effectiveness, and innovation, can have quite negative impact on their future competitiveness, and even put at risk their survival. However, these negative consequences of economic crises differ significantly among firms: some of them exhibit a lower vulnerability to the crisis, so they have less negative consequences, while some other firms exhibit a higher vulnerability, and have more negative consequences; so the competitive position of the former is significantly strengthened with respect to the latter, and finally the former are the ‘winners’ of the crisis, while the latter are the ‘losers’. This paper proposes a methodology for predicting the winner and loser firms of future economic crises with respect to a highly important class of technologies: the digital technologies. In particular, the proposed methodology enables the prediction of the multi-dimensional ‘pattern of digital vulnerability’ of an individual firm to a future economic crisis, which consists of the degrees of reduction of the main types of ‘digital investments’ as well as ‘digital operating expenses’ in a future economic crisis. For this purpose, we are using Machine Learning algorithms, in combination with the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), in order to increase their performance, which are trained using open government data from Statistical Authorities. Furthermore, a first application/validation of the proposed methodology is presented, using open data from the Greek Statistical Authority for 363 firms for the severe Greek economic crisis period 2009–2014, which gave satisfactory results concerning the prediction of nine different aspects of digital vulnerability to economic crisis (five of them concerned the main types of digital investment, and the other four concerned the main types of digital operating expenses). © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",-1,10.1007/978-3-031-56478-9_11,"This paper proposes a methodology to predict firms' vulnerability to economic crises, focusing on digital technology investments.

"Although Artificial Intelligence can offer significant business benefits, many consumers have negative perceptions of AI, leading to negative reactions when companies act ethically and disclose its use. Based on the pervasive example of content creation (e.g., via tools like ChatGPT), this research examines the potential for human-AI collaboration to preserve consumers' message credibility judgments and attitudes towards the company. The study compares two distinct forms of human-AI collaboration, namely AI-supported human authorship and human-controlled AI authorship, with traditional human authorship or full automation. Building on the compensatory control theory and the algorithm aversion concept, the study evaluates whether disclosing a high human input share (without explicit control) or human control over AI (with lower human input share) can mitigate negative consumer reactions. Moreover, this paper investigates the moderating role of consumers’ perceived morality of companies’ AI use. Results from two experiments in different contexts reveal that human-AI collaboration can alleviate negative consumer responses, but only when the collaboration indicates human control over AI. Furthermore, the effects of content authorship depend on consumers' moral acceptance of a company's AI use. AI authorship forms without human control lead to more negative consumer responses in case of low perceived morality (and no effects in case of high morality), whereas messages from AI with human control were not perceived differently to human authorship, irrespective of the morality level. These findings provide guidance for managers on how to effectively integrate human-AI collaboration into consumer-facing applications and advises to take consumers' ethical concerns into account. © The Author(s) 2024.",-1,10.1007/s11846-024-00748-y,"This paper examines consumer perceptions of AI in content creation and the effects of different human-AI collaboration models on consumer attitudes.

"Purpose: Engaging in webcare, i.e. responding to online reviews, can positively affect consumer attitudes, intentions and behavior. Research is often scarce or inconsistent regarding the effects of specific webcare strategies on business performance. Therefore, this study tests whether and how several webcare strategies affect hotel bookings. Design/methodology/approach: We apply machine learning classifiers to secondary data (webcare messages) to classify webcare variables to be included in a regression analysis looking at the effect of these strategies on hotel bookings while controlling for possible confounds such as seasonality and hotel-specific effects. Findings: The strategies that have a positive effect on bookings are directing reviewers to a private channel, being defensive, offering compensation and having managers sign the response. Webcare strategies to be avoided are apologies, merely asking for more information, inviting customers for another visit and adding informal non-verbal cues. Strategies that do not appear to affect future bookings are expressing gratitude, personalizing and having staff members (rather than managers) sign webcare. Practical implications: These findings help managers optimize their webcare strategy for better business results and develop automated webcare.

"As an important carrier of the real economy and the main body of the socialist market economy, China′s enterprises still own profound market potential and strong expansion power, whose capability of innovating independently plays a vital role in the development of enterprises. The independent innovation ability of enterprises is encouraged by government support and enterprise innovation incentive mechanism. At present, the government and enterprises demonstrate a vague function in improving the enterprises′ innovation ability. Enterprises gaining excessive governmental support and forming overreliance on supporting policies will easily fail their innovation into the whirlpool of “ support paradox”, causing the loss of public resources and enterprises to habitually rely on external support for scientific and technological research and development (R&D). To solve the above problems, this paper firstly clarifies the reasons for the paradox generated by governmental support for enterprise innovation from the perspective of the enterprise-government relationship. By applying Boosting regression tree model in machine learning algorithm as the research method, this paper selects the data of A-share listed enterprises in China from 2010 to 2019, to focus on the impact of China′s governmental support and internal incentive mechanism on enterprise innovation activities, and how internal innovation incentives play a more effective role in stimulating enterprise innovation activities. The first part discusses the influence given by government support and enterprises′ internal incentives on enterprise innovation activities. The results show that both can affect enterprise innovation activities which however demonstrate higher dependency on governmental support, among which government subsidy has a stronger influence and ordinary employees′ promotion incentive has a higher influential intensity in enterprise internal incentive mechanism. The second part further discusses how government support and internal incentive mechanism affect enterprise innovation from the following perspectives: 1) When the concentration of government support to different industries varies, the influence of government support and internal incentives on enterprise innovation activities is studied. The results show that R&D activities of enterprises in all professions all illustrate high dependency on government support, especially on government subsidies, no matter how high or low the concentration of support is. However, the effects of enterprises′ internal incentives are different in two types of government support concentration. In the industries with low government support concentration, the R&D process of enterprises is more affected by the promotion incentives of internal ordinary employees, while in the industries with high support concentration, the promotion incentive of enterprise executives highlights its role in enterprise innovation activities. 2) The study on the influence of promotion incentives in the same industry on enterprise innovation activities has been conducted. The results show that the R&D activities of enterprises are still more susceptible to government support when employees can get higher pay than the industry′s average. At this time, the promotion incentive of managers can exert more incentive effect on R&D activities of enterprises in the internal innovation incentive mechanism of enterprises, 3) The influence of government support and internal incentive mechanism on innovation activities of different enterprises is studied. The heterogeneity of enterprise property rights also determines enterprises′ different operation modes and incentive modes. The results show that the R&D activities of enterprises with different property rights are more affected by government support, while in the internal incentive mechanism of enterprises, vice presidents′ promotion incentive has the strongest effect on R&D activities of enterprises, but ordinary employee promotion incentive and equity incentive in private enterprises are of exploitable potential. Overall at present, China′s enterprises rely more on government support for innovation activities, especially on government subsidies, while the incentive mechanism within enterprises is insufficient.

"The landscape of digital transformation is marked by profound shifts in organizational structures and operational models. Central to this transformation is the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI), presenting a myriad of challenges and opportunities, particularly in collaborative management and human resource allocation. This study delves into the application of AI technologies in fostering organizational innovation, with a focus on their impact on structural adjustments. It has been observed that, despite the implementation of such technologies, a comprehensive analysis and evaluation of their effectiveness and potential for optimization within organizations are notably absent in existing literature. This gap is addressed by employing the RoBERTa-Whole Word Masking (WWM) deep model for the rapid identification and integration of knowledge in collaborative management via project text similarity detection. Furthermore, multi-agent reinforcement learning is utilized to enhance the efficiency and responsiveness of human resource allocation in organizational structures. The research highlights the need for an in-depth discussion on the adaptability of these technologies across diverse organizational environments and a thorough assessment of their practical benefits. The study enriches existing research by providing a thorough theoretical and empirical analysis and introduces innovative approaches for intelligent restructuring within organizational frameworks.

"The early detection of discontinuous change plays a decisive role in the performance and competitiveness of organizations. Whether and how top managers perceive change is mostly determined by their attention. However, research has shown that many top managers are often unable to allocate their attention properly and may therefore react with inertia or not at all to relevant changes. This raises the question of how managerial attention can be influenced to make top managers more receptive to discontinuous changes. A promising approach to this problem may come from the growing research field on the impact of AI on strategic decision-making. In this paper, I provide a conceptual framework of how the use of AI might help top managers better focus their attention on discontinuous change. Based on a systematic literature review and an attentional model, I highlight factors that influence top managers' attention allocation and likely enhance or inhibit it through the use of AI. This allows me to derive propositions for the application of AI in discontinuous change detection that can serve as a starting point for future empirical research.

"As the sharing economy continues to disrupt incumbent services, whether and how incumbents respond to the competition remains largely unknown. We investigate how incumbents can utilize management responses—a managerial intervention to guest reviews—to exploit performance improvement opportunities in guest reviews and sustain competitive advantage facing increased competition from home sharing. Our method integrates quasi-experiments, topic modeling, and deep learning techniques to not only estimate the impact of home sharing but also unveil the performance improvement mechanism. The findings reveal distinctive management response strategies across hotel price segments after home sharing's entry, which lead to divergent performance outcomes in guest satisfaction and sales. Regardless of their price segments, any hotel that responds more actively to guest reviews demonstrates improved guest satisfaction in service areas where home-sharing leads (e.g., check-in/out, cleanliness, sightseeing opportunity, and room conditions) and achieves higher sales. In contrast, hotels that respond less to guest reviews appear to lose guest satisfaction and sales to not only home sharing but also peer hotel cohorts that respond more.

"We collaborated with a leading fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) manufacturer to investigate how intelligent image processing (IIP)-based shelf monitoring aids manufacturers’ shelf management by using data from a quasi-experiment and a field experiment. We discovered that such artificial intelligence (AI) assistance significantly and consistently improves product sales. Several underlying mechanisms were revealed by our quantitative and qualitative analysis. First, retailers are more likely to comply due to the greater monitoring effectiveness enabled by AI assistance. Second, the positive effect of IIP-based shelf monitoring partially persists after it is terminated, implying that human learning takes place. Third, the value of IIP-based shelf monitoring can be attributed to independent retailers rather than chain retailers. Since the degree of contract heterogeneity is the major difference between these retailers in terms of monitoring, this finding further suggests that AI is relatively more scalable when coping with more heterogeneous instances. Apart from these great benefits, we demonstrate the low marginal costs of implementing IIP-powered shelf monitoring, which indicates its long-term applicability and potential to generate incremental value.

"Startups’ interorganizational networks with venture capitalists (VCs) and technological partners largely affect their likelihood of obtaining external financing, and different networks (e.g., startup-VC investment network, VC syndication network, and startup-partner co-patenting network) may function differently and collectively. However, prior studies have mainly regarded different networks as homogeneous or isolated due to the difficulty dealing with heterogeneous, connected networks by econometrics methods. Following the “Algorithm Supported Induction for Building Theory” research paradigm, we construct heterogeneous, dynamic networks by using machine learning and self-develop an innovative hybrid composition layer to combine multiple networks. The results show that our model predicts startups’ subsequent financing more precisely than human investors or machine learning methods without the hybrid composition layer. We further find that a hybrid of investment network and syndication network outperforms that of investment network and co-patenting network, and theoretical propositions are developed.

"The study proposal proposes an innovative strategy for managing modern transport networks, with an emphasis on the coordinated use of analytics, real-time data processing, and dynamic decision-making utilizing stream data models. To create a solid infrastructure for real-time data analysis, it is required to use a diverse set of data sources, such as sensors, GPS devices, traffic cameras, and mobile application software. A strategy for reaching this goal is described below. The real-time system that integrates transportation models, artificial intelligence, and data mining is at the core of this strategy. In addition to monitoring and assessment, one of the key responsibilities of this system is to develop the transportation network. Without this framework as a foundation, the method would be worthless. This collaborative effort provides proactive traffic control, efficient route planning, and event prediction in real time. The application of machine learning in predictive analytics and traffic analysis, which together give solid traffic forecasts, prompts the creation of tactics that cut wait times and enhance productivity.

"The importance of incorporating human values (e.g., transparency, privacy, social recognition, tradition) in the Requirements Engineering (RE) process is well-acknowledged, but there is a paucity of empirical research for integrating human values in RE. This shortfall becomes more pronounced when designing Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems due to their significant societal impact. Ignoring or violating human values in AI systems can lead to user dissatisfaction, negative socio-economic repercussions, and in some instances, societal harm. However, there is a lack of guidance on addressing human values within the RE process for specific contexts of AI system development. In this paper, we explore human value requirements from the end-users' feedback for an AI system. We conduct an empirical analysis of the Amazon Alexa app as a case study, examining 1003 users' reviews to identify relevant human values and assess the extent to which these values are addressed or ignored in the app. We identified 34 values of the end-users of Amazon Alexa. Among them, only one value is addressed (self-discipline) and 23 of them are ignored (freedom, equality, obedience) in the app. The feedback provided mixed experiences (both addressed and ignored) on the rest of the ten values. Through this analysis, we have tailored an approach for identifying human values from a specific type of AI system.

"This research aims to comprehend the complex processes that underpin the adoption and implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) in the Swiss public sector, particularly the challenges that arise from these processes. Applying the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) framework, we examine six cases, evaluating the maturity levels of technical, organizational, and environmental processes and pinpointing the issues that emerge. Our findings reveal that despite the widespread adoption of AI in other industries, the Swiss public sector faces unique hurdles tied to its implementation processes. A key challenge is the persistent concern around data protection and privacy, which hinders AI adoption even in the presence of existing encryption technologies. Our analysis also unveils other obstacles, such as infrastructure inadequacies, lack of top management support, and data management issues. By dissecting these implementation processes and their associated challenges, this paper underscores the need for public administrations to not only implement existing data protection technologies but also to manage other crucial aspects of AI adoption efficiently.

"Purpose: The smart contract provides an opportunity to improve existing contract management practices in the construction projects by replacing traditional contracts. However, translating the contracts into computer languages is considered a major challenge which has not been investigated. Thus, it is necessary to: (1) identify the obstructing clauses in real-world contracts; and (2) analyze the replacement's technical and economic feasibility. This paper aims to discuss the aforementioned objectives. Design/methodology/approach: This study identified the flexibility clauses of traditional contracts and their corresponding functions through inductive content analysis with representative standard contracts as materials. Through a speculative analysis in accordance to design science paradigm and new institutional economics, the economic and technical feasibility of existing approaches, including enumeration method, fuzzy algorithm, rough sets theory, machine learning and artificial intelligence, to transform respective clauses (functions) into executable codes are analyzed. Findings: The clauses of semantic flexibility and structural flexibility are identified from the contracts. The transformation of semantic flexibility is economically and/or technically infeasible with existing methods and materials. But with more data as materials and methods of rough sets or machine learning, the transformation can be feasible. The transformation of structural flexibility is technically possible however economically unacceptable. Practical implications: Given smart contracts' inability to provide the required flexibility for construction projects, smart contracts will be more effective in less relational contracts. For construction contracts, the combination of smart contracts and traditional contracts is recommended. In the long run, with the sharing or trading of data in the industry level and the integration of machine learning or artificial intelligence reducing relevant costs, the automation of contract management can be achieved. Originality/value: This study contributes to the understanding of the smart contract's limitations in industry scenarios and its role in construction project management. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",-1,10.1108/ECAM-04-2023-0379,"This paper examines the challenges of translating traditional construction contracts into smart contracts, focusing on identifying obstructing clauses and analyzing the feasibility of various AI methods for this transformation.

"One of the most serious problems of the market-based economies are the instabilities of the economic activity (business cycles), which are sometimes large and lead to recessionary economic crises of different intensities, geographical scopes and durations, and have quite negative consequences for firms. Governments, in order to reduce these negative consequences of economic crises, which can lead to high levels of unemployment and poverty, as well social unrest and political extremism, undertake various interventions, such as large-scale economic stimulus programs. However, in order to maximize their cost-effectiveness, as well as the economic and social value they generate, it is necessary that they are properly targeted and directed to/focused on the most vulnerable firms to the economic crisis. This paper describes a methodology that can be quite useful for this: it enables the prediction of multi-dimensional patterns of individual firms’ vulnerability to economic crisis with respect to the main aspects of their financial situation. For this purpose, Machine Learning algorithms are used, in combination with the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) for increasing their performance, which are trained using open government data from Statistical Authorities. Furthermore, a first application/validation of the proposed methodology is presented, using open data from the Greek Statistical Authority about 363 firms for the severe Greek economic crisis period 2009–2014, which gave satisfactory results. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",-1,10.1007/978-3-031-43126-5_14,"This paper develops a methodology using machine learning to predict firms' vulnerability to economic crises, aiming to improve the targeting of government interventions.

"Automation and competition are challenging the Indian information technology (IT) service organisations. Significant portions of the revenue earned by Indian IT service organisations come from the low end of the value chain. Technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) are expected to automate these low value-added services. Many other low-cost locations are emerging as competitors for the Indian IT industry. New technologies also offer scope for high-value services. This study proposes a theoretical model based on the resource-based view to understand the phenomenon of moving up the value chain in IT services. Data collected from 230 employees of Indian IT service organisations were analysed using structural equation modelling. The results show that the relationship management capability and the project management capability of the IT service organisation improve the quality of the service provided, which in turn enables the organisation to move up the value chain of IT services.

"Since the 2010s, venture capital (VC) investment in artificial intelligence (AI)-related startups has increased rapidly, and numerous startups have achieved exits through Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) and Mergers and Acquisitions (M&As). In this study, we investigate the relationship between the expansion of social recognition of AI (exposure of AI) and the entry of VC investment into this area, and whether VCs that invested earlier in the AI area ('trend leaders') overperformed their peers. As a result, VC entry into AI has expanded with the growth of social recognition. Still, VCs that invested in the AI area earlier and accumulated AI investment experience do not necessarily have a higher probability of achieving an exit. However, early entry into more specific business or technology domains within AI and the accumulated investment experience in these domains increased the likelihood of exit. This study is a new approach to researching VC investments in specific themes.

"Though the growth of the gig economy has coincided with increased economic precarity in the new economy, we know less about the extent to which gig work (compared with other self-employment arrangements and non-gig work) may fuel economic insecurity among American households. We fill this gap in the literature by drawing on a sample of 4,756 workers from a unique national survey capturing economic hardships among non-standard workers like app- and platform-based gig and other self-employed workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results from generalized boosted regression modeling, utilizing machine learning to account for potential endogeneity, demonstrated that gig workers experienced significantly greater economic hardship than non-gig and other self-employed workers during the pandemic. For example, gig workers were more likely to experience food insecurity, miss bill payments, and suffer income loss compared with non-gig and other self-employed workers during the pandemic. While household liquid assets endowment prior to the pandemic reduced the effect of gig work on experiencing economic hardships, having dependent children in the household increased this effect. Thus, contrary to democratizing entrepreneurship opportunities, these findings suggest that the expansion of the gig economy may exacerbate labor market inequality, where wealth-endowed families are protected against adverse economic consequences of the gig economy. We discuss the implications of these findings for inequality-reducing labor market policies, including policies that account for the interconnectedness of family and the labor market. © The Author(s) 2023.",-1,10.1177/07308884231202032,"This paper examines the economic hardships faced by gig workers compared to non-gig and self-employed workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Forecasting-based skills management, which is oriented to the respective corporate goals, is gaining enormous importance as a central management tool. The aim is to predict future skills requirements and match them with existing interorganizational skills. Companies are required to anticipate changes in markets, industries, and technologies at an early stage as well as to identify changes in job profiles within an occupational profile by tapping into and evaluating various data sources. Based on these findings, they can then make informed decisions regarding skill gaps, for example, to implement targeted further training measures. Forecasting-based skills management offers the opportunity to optimally qualify employees for constantly changing tasks. At the same time, however, the targeted development of such skills requires a high level of time, financial and personnel resources, which small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) generally do not have at their disposal. In addition, many SMEs are not yet aware of the importance of this issue. Within the framework of research and industrial projects of the Smart Work department at the FIR (Institute for Industrial Management) at the RWTH Aachen University, an AI-based skills forecasting tool will be developed. The goal of the paper is to conceptualize the future machine learning method, that is able to generate individualized skills forecasts and recommendations for SMEs. This is achieved by linking societal forecasts and sector trends with company-specific conditions and skills. In order to generate a corresponding database, the derivation system is made available to various companies (large companies and SMEs) in order to obtain as many data sets as possible. The data sets obtained via the derivation system are then used as training data sets for the machine learning method, with the help of which an automatic derivation of competencies depending on new trends is to be made possible. © 2023, Publish-Ing in cooperation with TIB - Leibniz Information Centre for Science and Technology University Library.

"Companies nowadays are increasingly dependent on data. In an environment that is more dynamic than ever, they are looking for tools to leverage those data and obtain valuable information in a rapid and flexible way. One way to achieve this is by using Data-Driven Decision Support Systems (Data-Driven DSS). In this project, I focus on one such type of DSS, namely the Self-Service Business Intelligence (SSBI) Systems. These systems are designed specifically to avoid the involvement of the IT department when creating business reports by empowering businesspeople in the production of their own reports, thereby reducing the time-to-release of a given report and improving the responsiveness of companies. Business decision-makers, when developing their own reports, however face barriers. These challenges are related to the current self-service features that are not sufficiently adapted to their business needs and their lack of technical knowledge.

"The use of machine learning promises great potential along the entire value chain of manufacturing companies. Many companies have already recognized the resulting opportunities for increasing enterprise value and are developing their machine learning applications for the production environment. However, despite these efforts, many of the solutions developed fail in the market. Especially small-and medium-sized enterprises have difficulties developing suitable business models for their technical applications. These difficulties arise because companies do not evaluate their business projects sufficiently during the development phases. As a result, unpromising projects are not recognized until late in the development process and thus cause high sunk costs. This paper presents an approach for integrating assessment methods into developing machine learning-driven business models for production. Due to the diametric evolution of information availability and uncertainty during the business model development process, various methods and tools can be used for the assessment depending on the current phase.

"Many insurance companies still depend on agents for marketing and selling their products. The compensation for these agents is based mainly on commissions and hence such agents try to sell as many policies as possible. In addition to increasing the quantity of policies sold, agents may try to recommend policies with high commissions even if other policies are more suitable for the client. Furthermore, agents may at times ill-advise customers to change their policies in order to gain a new commission even if such a change does not benefit the customer or the insurance company. This last type of transaction is called internal insurance churn or policy churn since the customer remains with the insurance company but they make a policy change. We use Machine Learning techniques to predict policy churn prior to payment of the commission to the agent. This avoids the process of having the agent repay the commission (a process termed clawback) in such cases.

Developing financial innovations, such as crowdfunding, mobile payments, AI-based credit scoring systems, and even blockchain technologies has an immense potential to increase financial inclusion, increase access to finance for individuals and businesses, enabling the unscored or unbanked population to become active members of financial markets. Studies have shown the positive impact of financial technology on individuals' financial inclusion and access to finance, but the development of the Fintech phenomenon does not itself imply improved access to finance for businesses. The spread and adoption of Fintech are taken as evidence of financial innovation This research aims to explore the expected interaction between financial innovation and financial inclusion in selected European countries. The data from the Global Fintech Ranking and Survey on the access to finance of enterprises (SAFE) is used in this study, examining them by comparing countries by their Fintech rankings and respective rank position obtained by measuring the importance of access to finance as a problem in business development. The analysis of 29 European countries indicates that theoretically defined expectations are met in most cases: access to finance is not an important problem for the companies from the countries that are ranked higher in the Fintech rating report. But part of the sampled countries deviates from this trend.

"At present, the trend of artificial intelligence (AI) for product innovation is becoming widespread, and many manufacturers enhance their products with AI. In the process of AI-enabled product production and sales, manufacturers must make decisions on not only the retail prices of AI-enabled products but also whether to reprice their original products. This study investigates the optimal decisions for manufacturers, considering the degree of consumers' AI preference and the substitutability of the two products. We find that manufacturers often need to reprice their regular products after launching AI-enabled products to gain maximum benefits.

"Recently, Gen AI has garnered significant attention across various sectors of society, particularly capturing the interest of small business due to its capacity to allow them to reassess their business models with minimal investment. To understand how small and medium-sized firms have utilised Gen AI-based tools to cope with the market's high level of turbulence caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical crises, and economic slowdown, researchers have conducted an empirical study. Although Gen AI is receiving more attention, there remains a dearth of empirical studies that investigate how it influences the entrepreneurial orientation of firms and their ability to cultivate entrepreneurial resilience amidst market turbulence. Most of the literature offers anecdotal evidence. To address this research gap, the authors have grounded their theoretical model and research hypotheses in the contingent view of dynamic capability. They tested the research hypotheses using cross-sectional data from a pre-tested survey instrument, which yielded 87 useable responses from small and medium enterprises in France. The authors used variance-based structural equation modelling with the commercial WarpPLS 7.0 software to test the theoretical model. The study's findings suggest that Gen AI and EO have a significant influence on building entrepreneurial resilience as higher-order and lower-order dynamic capabilities. However, market turbulence has a negative moderating effect on the path that joins entrepreneurial orientation and entrepreneurial resilience. The results suggest that the assumption that high market turbulence will have positive effects on dynamic capabilities and competitive advantage is not always true, and the linear assumption does not hold, which is consistent with some scholars' assumptions.

"The purpose of this paper is twofold. Firstly, we provide evidence that relying on Type I, Type II and overall error rates to select a model for analysing the financial health of audit clients can result in greater costs than using our alternative approach. Secondly, we show that auditors who use an artificial neural network (ANN) as a tool to analyse the financial viability of audit clients need to consider the underlying ANN paradigm before developing a model in order to minimise audit costs. Our results show that a categorical learning neural network (CLN) minimises the overall cost associated with the auditor examination of audit client financial health.

"The rise in AI-based assessments in hiring contexts has led to significant media speculation regarding their role in exacerbating or mitigating employment inequities. In this study, we examined 46,214 ratings from 4947 interviews to ascertain if gender differences in ratings were related to interactions among content (stereotype-relevant competencies), context (occupational gender composition), and rater type (human vs. algorithm). Contrary to the hypothesized effects of smaller gender differences in algorithmic scoring than with human raters, we found that both human and algorithmic ratings of men on agentic competencies were higher than those given to women.

"Estimating economic performance in data poor, fragile, and conflict environments with weak capacities for the generation of timely and quality official statistics is challenging. Drawing on recent advances in the use of remote sensing data to estimate economic activities, this paper identifies the observable variables that are correlated with nighttime lights in urban South Sudan. With a focus on the three major cities of Juba, Malakal and Wau, a machine learning aided regression model constructed using a backward stepwise selection approach demonstrates that population, carbon dioxide, private sector credit, as well as climate and conflict events, can explain much of the variability in the nighttime lights time series for Juba – the capital city. Nighttime lights in the next period can be accurately forecasted using these variables.

"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to empirically explore how firms configure centrifugal and centripetal forces in promoting breakthrough innovation (BI), thus improving their strategic performance (SP) in the artificial intelligence (AI) context. Design/methodology/approach: This study applies the centrifugal and centripetal forces model to a survey sample of 285 Chinese AI firms. Fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) and propensity score matching (PSM) are integrated to explore the configurational effects of three centrifugal forces—the autonomy of technical experts, knowledge search and alliance network—and two centripetal forces—strictness of organisational institutions (SOI) and human–human–AI collaboration (HHAC)—on BI, examining whether the configurations that enhance BI can further improve SP. Findings: The results indicate that the strictness of innovation institutions (SII) and strictness of ethical institutions (SEI) are equally important for determining SOI. Three configurations can improve BI when SOI and HHAC are the core conditions; only one of three configurations can further improve SP significantly. Originality/value: By introducing SOI composed of equally important levels of SII and SEI and HHAC, this research is one of the few empirical studies to explore the mechanisms behind the impact of centrifugal and centripetal forces on BI and SP, which may help researchers and managers address innovation challenges in the AI context. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",-1,10.1108/EJIM-06-2022-0292,This study empirically examines how centrifugal and centripetal forces influence breakthrough innovation and strategic performance in AI firms.

"Firm innovation is a complex and multidimensional process that is affected by internal and external factors. Companies and governments have traditionally tried to promote in-house innovation by promoting research and development investment. In an economy characterized by a large percentage of small- and medium-sized enterprises and continuous change toward digital and green transition, many companies struggle to innovate because of their lack of resources, knowledge, or capabilities. In this context, the external links and networks that materialize through active engagement in innovation activities with market and institutional agents are key, and analyzing cooperation for innovation is essential to obtain an overview to promote innovation. This study contributes to the understanding of (1) the drivers in innovative companies that lead to cooperation with external agents for innovation; (2) the relative importance of these drivers for cooperation; (3) the extent to which the eco-innovation orientation of a company affects its engagement in collaborations with other stakeholders; and (4) an understanding of the differences in the cooperation drivers according to the type of collaborator (institutional, market, or both). Using data from the Spanish Technological Innovation Panel and machine-learning techniques, we confirm the importance of internal and external factors, namely public financing, the environmental and social orientation of innovation, and the commitment to innovation. This research also reveals the asymmetric impact of many of the cooperation drivers, and that company cooperation with both market and institutional agents leads to higher innovation performance.

"To date, innovation management research on idea evaluation has focused on human experts and crowd evaluators. With recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), idea evaluation and selection processes need to keep up. As a result, the potential role of AI-enabled systems in idea evaluation has become an important topic in innovation management research and practice. While AI can help overcome human capacity constraints and biases, prior research has identified also aversive behaviors of humans toward AI. However, research has also shown lay people's appreciation of AI. This study focuses on human crowdvoters’ AI adoption behavior. More precisely, we focus on gig workers, who despite often lacking expert knowledge are frequently engaged in crowdvoting. To investigate crowdvoters' AI adoption behavior, we conducted a behavioral experimental study (n = 629) with incentive-compatible rewards in a human-AI augmentation scenario. The participants had to predict the success or failure of crowd-generated ideas. In multiple rounds, participants could opt to delegate their decisions to an AI-enabled system or to make their own evaluations. Our findings contribute to the innovation management literature on open innovation, more specifically crowdvoting, by observing how human crowdvoters engage with AI. In addition to showing that the lay status of gig workers does not lead to an appreciation of AI, we identify factors that foster AI adoption in this specific innovation context. We hereby find mixed support for influencing factors previously identified in other contexts, including financial incentives, social incentives, and the provision of information about AI-enabled system's functionality.

"Software is the foundation of the digital economy. The scope of software patent protection and the social and private value of software patenting are hence central to recent policy debates. The landmark 2014 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Alice Corp v. CLS Bank had a profound impact on software patenting, drastically narrowing the scope of patent protection on software innovation. We theorize and provide empirical evidence that a narrower scope of software patent protection is associated with a greater degree of open-source activities and improved sales in software firms. We also evaluate how individual firm’s ex ante software patent stock may moderate the proposed relationships. These findings offer insights into the roles of patent scope for software innovation in the digital economy and have important implications for the software patent and digital innovation literatures.

"This study proposes a fuzzy multi-criteria model to assess the risk of unemployment among professionals in the communication sector in Turkey, prompted by the rapid development and evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. The method integrates Fuzzy The Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (F-DEMATEL) and Fuzzy Logarithm Methodology of Additive Weights (F-LMAW) procedures. Data were collected from 20 experts representing professions such as public relations, advertising, journalism, and design through a 12-question survey. In the analysis, the F-DEMATEL procedure was initially employed to determine attitudes towards AI technologies, followed by the application of the F-LMAW procedure to assess the magnitude of AI's impact on occupational groups. Findings reveal a nuanced stance: while professionals acknowledge the necessity of AI for their work, they are unwilling to accept unemployment due to more advanced AI. This newly identified structure, termed Post-Luddism, highlights concerns over technological unemployment, particularly pronounced in professions like journalism where job prospects are limited and creative thinking is paramount. In other communication fields, the intensive use of technology mitigates fears of AI harm. However, even in journalism, there exists a propensity to perceive AI as detrimental.

"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing every facet of the business landscape. Early adopter firms have implemented AI for various reasons, but the number one benefit realized is increased innovation (Jyoti & Riley, 2022). Early adopters of AI for new product development (NPD) not only demonstrate that AI finds many applications in NPD, but also offers substantial payoffs. This AI revolution is coming fast, estimated to have a 13–15 year window of adoption, peaking before the end of this decade. This article focuses on AI applications in three target areas in the new product process, where the need for better solutions is high, and the applications for AI show significant benefits. They are: 1) idea generation and concept creation and testing; 2) building a robust business case leading to better “go-to-development” investment decisions; and 3) the design, engineering, development, and testing of the product. AI applications in each of these three target areas are described briefly, along with some in-depth case illustrations of AI at work in NPD, and the benefits achieved by leading firms. These benefits include a remarkable reduction in development and testing times; optimally designed products; better and more appealing new product ideas and concepts; and more effective and productive voice-of-customer studies. Despite the reported benefits of AI in NPD, the adoption rate is quite low, about 13% across firms globally (McKinsey, 2023); thus, AI for NPD was in the “early adopter” stage of the Rogers diffusion of innovation curve by early 2023. Impediments to adoption are outlined, based on numerous studies: the lack of a strong business case; high perceived costs of adoption; the lack of corporate readiness and the right mindset; and risks and ethical issues. High uncertainties remain regarding the adoption of AI in NPD, and many unknowns still exist; thus, numerous opportunities for academic research are identified in the form of research questions begging to be answered.

"Scientific and technological progress is largely driven by firms in many domains, including artificial intelligence and vaccine development. The early identification of the future performance of innovation players is a relevant goal for policymakers and practitioners. In this work, we investigate how the future trajectory of a firm can be predicted by the economic or technological value of its early patents. By inspecting the patenting life cycles of 7440 publicly listed firms, we find that the economic value of a firm's early patents is an accurate predictor of various dimensions of a firm's future research success. At the same time, a smaller set of future top-performers do not generate early patents of high economic value, but they are detectable via the technological value of their early patents. Importantly, the observed heterogeneity of the firms’ temporal success patterns markedly differs from the patterns previously observed for individuals’ research careers. © 2024 The Author(s)",-1,10.1016/j.techfore.2024.123208,"This paper examines how the economic and technological value of early patents can predict the future performance of firms, particularly in innovation sectors like AI and vaccine development.

"In December 2023, public-transportation providers in Switzerland introduced Public-Transportation Credits (PTCs). PTCs are credits (or “allowances”) that are greater in amount than their price and can be used to purchase any type of public-transportation tickets within a year. With the initial fixed payment, the subsequent use of the allowance and the eventual return to the standard fare, PTCs represent three-part tariff models. We explore the potential of PTCs to target particularly elastic segments of the demand curve, simultaneously allowing for increased consumption and higher revenue. To assess the revenue impact of the PTC empirically, we analyze a pilot study conducted by the Swiss public-transportation providers. In a randomized field experiment with 200,000 PTC invitees and 911 actual PTC buyers, we use the dispach of invitations as an instrumental variable. While observing substantial revenue increases, this result is insignificant due to the weak relationship between invitees and buyers. Therefore, we complement our analysis with a selection-on-observable approach, utilizing machine-learning techniques to match PTC buyers to customers in the control group. This way, we reveal a highly significant treatment effect, indicating a revenue enhancement of CHF 179.7 per PTC (approximately USD 200). Leveraging our comprehensive dataset and insights from a non-buyer survey, we predict a demand of around 200,000 units for the market-launch version of the PTC. © 2024 The Authors",-1,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104022,"This paper evaluates the impact of Public-Transportation Credits (PTCs) on revenue for Swiss public-transportation providers through a randomized field experiment.

"Purpose: This editorial for the 6th World Conference on Production and Operations Management (P&OM) 2022 Special Issue delves into the transformative role of advanced artificial intelligence (AI)-driven chatbots in reshaping operations, supply chain management and logistics (OSCM). It aligns with the conference’s theme of exploring the intersection between P&OM and strategy during the Technological Revolution. Design/methodology/approach: Utilizing a conceptual approach, this paper introduces the “ERI Framework,” a tool designed to evaluate the impact of AI-driven chatbots in three critical operational dimensions: efficiency (E), responsiveness (R) and intelligence (I). This framework is grounded in disruptive debottlenecking theory and real-world applications, offering a novel structure for analysis. Findings: The conceptual analysis suggests immediate benefits of chatbots in enhancing decision-making and resource allocation, thereby alleviating operational bottlenecks. However, it sees challenges such as workforce adaptation and potential impacts on creativity and sustainability. Practical implications: The paper suggests that while chatbots present opportunities for optimizing operational processes, organizations must thoughtfully address the emerging challenges to maintain productivity and foster innovation. Strategic implementation and employee training are highlighted as key factors for successful integration.

"Russian aggression adversely affected the economy of Ukraine and emphasized the need to adapt the best practices of EU countries to determine steps to restore the country’s competitiveness. This study aims to determine the influence of the innovative development of countries on their competitiveness and identify prospects for Ukraine’s post-war economic recovery. The study constructed neural networks to assess the relationships between the factors of innovative development and the competitiveness of the EU countries and Ukraine. Six main factors of innovative development of countries are identified: “innovations in business (S1),” “intellectual property (S2)”, “innovations in industry (S3),” “eco-innovations (S4),” “innovation management (S5),” and “digital innovations (S5).” Groups of factors are determined by the strength of influence (strong, moderate, or weak). For Ukraine, S1 and S6 have a strong effect (33.3%), S5 shows moderate (16.7%), S2, S3, and S4 show weak effects (50%). For EU countries, S1 and S6 have a strong influence, S2 and S3 – moderate, S5 and S4 – weak.

"Virtual agents (VAs) are increasingly used by firms to establish relationships with customers. While this form of artificial intelligence offers numerous advantages, adverse outcomes can arise when customers’ expectations of VAs are not met. This paper examines how the disconfirmation of both parasocial interactions with the VA and its anthropomorphic characteristics affects users’ dissatisfaction with the VA. Such dissatisfaction might then influence subsequent behavioural outcomes, specifically spreading negative word-of-mouth about the VA (NWOMVA) and avoiding future use of VAs. Data were gathered from VA users in Egypt and the UAE via an online questionnaire. The findings from the two studies confirm that all direct hypotheses were supported and that dissatisfaction with VAs mediates the relationships between both negative parasocial interaction disconfirmation (NPID) and negative VA anthropomorphism disconfirmation and the behavioural outcomes of NWOMVA and VA avoidance. Thus, this paper offers managers guidelines on the effective characteristics of VAs, namely anthropomorphism and parasocial interaction, which allow them to identify the pitfalls of VAs and take preventive or remedial actions. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",-1,10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2023.102721,"This paper examines the impact of virtual agents (VAs) on customer satisfaction and subsequent behaviors, focusing on how unmet expectations affect user dissatisfaction.

In addition, this study utilizes a Deeplab V3+ deep learning model using 233,106 Google Street View (GSV) panoramic images to empirically identify micro-scale streetscapes. Based on such data, we employ a hedonic price model to examine the interrelationships between both macro- and micro-scale walkable environments and single-family housing prices. Our findings show that paved sidewalks on streets are associated with higher housing prices in disadvantaged neighborhoods, while street greenery and a sense of enclosure are positively correlated in advantaged areas. In particular, the sense of enclosure presents diminishing marginal effects. Our findings can help policymakers and planners establish detailed design strategies and guidelines for creating walkable environments that can maximize these economic benefits. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",-1,10.1016/j.apgeog.2023.103182,"This study examines the economic effects of walkable environments on housing prices, utilizing a Deeplab V3+ deep learning model to analyze Google Street View images.

"In this study, we examine how competitive strategy affects firm-level stock liquidity. Following Porter’s (1980) classification of generic strategies, we categorize firms into differentiators and cost leaders, where differentiators aim to differentiate themselves by delivering unique products and services while cost leaders attempt to achieve a low-cost position through efficient cost control. We hypothesize that firms emphasizing differentiation strategies show higher stock liquidity than those adopting cost leadership strategies because differentiators attract more investor attention and trading activities due to their larger growth potential. Employing a competitive strategy measure developed by a machine-learning-based natural language processing approach of Seed-Words plus Word2Vec Similarity Word Extension, we find results supporting our hypothesis among China’s A-share listed firms. Additional analyses suggest that differentiators may improve stock liquidity by enhancing earnings quality, increasing asset liquidity, and reducing information asymmetry.

"Cognitive automation (CA) moves beyond rule-based business process automation to target cognitive knowledge and service work. This allows the automation of tasks and processes, for which automation seemed unimaginable a decade ago. To organizations, these CA use cases offer vast opportunities to gain a significant competitive advantage. However, CA imposes novel challenges on organizations’ decisions regarding the automation potential of use cases, resulting in low adoption and high project failure rates. To counteract this, we draw on an action research study with a leading European manufacturing company to develop and test a model for assessing use cases’ amenability to CA. The proposed model comprises four dimensions: cognition, data, relationship, and transparency requirements. The model proposes that a use case is less (more) amenable to CA if these requirements are high (low). To account for the model’s industry-agnostic generalizability, we draw on an internal evaluation within the action research company and three additional external evaluations undertaken by independent project teams in three distinct industries. From a practice perspective, the model will help organizations make more informed decisions in selecting use cases for CA and planning their respective initiatives. From a research perspective, the identified determinants affecting use cases’ amenability to CA will enhance our understanding of CA in particular and artificial intelligence as the driving force behind CA in general. © Association for Information Technology Trust 2023.",-1,10.1177/02683962231185599,"This paper develops a model to assess the suitability of use cases for cognitive automation (CA) based on four dimensions.

"The purpose of this paper is to provide a framework for overseeing that applications of artificial intelligence are ethically implemented and applied. With the expanding use of Generative AI (GAI) such as ChatGPT, Bard, DALL-E, and DeepMind, and the growing adoption of these technologies in Human Resource Development (HRD), there is a pressing need to address the ethical implications of these technologies. The challenges associated with AI and GAI include bias, fairness, transparency, safety and control, displacement and job loss, privacy intrusion, humanity, and agency. These concerns have significant implications for HRD practices and the broader organisational ecosystem. However, there is a lack of comprehensive frameworks and guidelines to address the related ethical challenges these technologies present, ensuring the responsible and humane use of AI and GAI in HRD.

"Artificial intelligence (AI) applications have proliferated, garnering significant interest among information systems (IS) scholars. AI-powered analytics, promising effective and low-cost decision augmentation, has become a ubiquitous aspect of contemporary organisations. Unlike traditional decision support systems (DSS) designed to support decisionmakers with fixed decision rules and models that often generate stable outcomes and rely on human agentic primacy, AI systems learn, adapt, and act autonomously, demanding recognition of IS agency within AI-augmented decision making (AIADM) systems. Given this fundamental shift in DSS; its influence on autonomy, responsibility, and accountability in decision making within organisations; the increasing regulatory and ethical concerns about AI use; and the corresponding risks of stochastic outputs, the extrapolation of prescriptive design knowledge from conventional DSS to AIADM is problematic. Hence, novel design principles incorporating contextual idiosyncrasies and practice-based domain knowledge are needed to overcome unprecedented challenges when adopting AIADM. To this end, we conduct an action design research (ADR) study within an e-commerce company specialising in producing and selling clothing. We develop an AIADM system to support marketing, consumer engagement, and product design decisions.

"Process mining is often used to identify opportunities for process automation leading to improved efficiency and cost savings. Robotic process automation (RPA) is a fast-growing area that provides tremendous productivity growth to a growing number of companies across many industries. RPA tools allow users to record their work and then propose areas for automation, and produce scripts to automate work. Recording how a process is conducted, coupled with process mining techniques, offers the most detailed view of what process is followed, how well it is followed, and whether there are areas for automation or improvement in process or policies. However, the main challenge to deriving these insights is the need for grouping fine-grained recorded tasks into events, giving them names, and proposing how to automate those high-level tasks. In this paper, we propose a framework for using large language models (LLMs) to assist users in these steps, by leveraging their natural language understanding and generation capabilities. We first address the problem of event log generation, which is an input of automation techniques, by using LLMs to group and label tasks based on their semantic similarity and context. We then tackle the problem of connector recommendation by using LLMs to recommend best plugins to automate tasks. We evaluate our approach on a real publicly available dataset, and show that it can improve the quality and efficiency of event log generation and connector recommendation, compared to the baseline methods. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",-1,10.1007/978-3-031-56107-8_29,"This paper proposes a framework that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to enhance process mining and robotic process automation (RPA) by improving event log generation and connector recommendations.

"Overview Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming all aspects of business, including new product development (NPD). Early adopters of AI for NPD are reaping substantial rewards, witnessing remarkable reductions in development timelines, and experiencing a more rapid pace of innovation. But what about the more typical firm? This article presents the preliminary results of a study of US and Central European companies, shedding light on the current state of AI implementation across 13 key AI applications in NPD. We found that companies studied have not yet fully embraced AI across any of these applications; 75 percent have failed to adopt AI for a single application; and “intention to adopt” for all 13 applications is quite weak. European firms are only marginally ahead of US firms. We conclude with important messages for management and offer six recommendations firms can use in their efforts to integrate AI into NPD.

"Employees increasingly co-produce services with artificial intelligence (AI). Focusing on system design, this research uncovers (1) which system features qualify an AI system as a so-called collaborative intelligence (CI) system, (2) to what extent CI systems influence work-related employee outcomes, and (3) which CI features relate to which outcomes. Based on an extensive literature review and a qualitative study, we demarcate CI from related concepts—such as hybrid intelligence, collective intelligence, and human-AI teaming—and identify five relevant CI system features: engagement, transparency, process control, outcome control, and reciprocal strength enhancement. Employing two scenario-based experiments with financial services employees (N = 309) and HR professionals (N = 345), we demonstrate that strong CI systems (i.e., characterized by the aforementioned five features) significantly relate to perceived service improvement, perceived outcome responsibility, (threat to) meaning of work, and adherence to the system. Particularly, transparency, process control, and outcome control are important design features, while, surprisingly, engagement seems less relevant.

"Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming healthcare, yet little is known about how consumers experience medical AI and make decisions about using these providers for follow-up care. We take an interdisciplinary approach that combines behavioral and neuroimaging experiments to determine how anthropomorphism and personalization influence consumers' well-being and their decisions about a provider for follow-up care. Study 1 finds that, regardless of the type of medical provider used, consumers are likely to experience a heightened sense of well-being after a highly personalized medical consultation. However, regardless of whether the first interaction is highly personalized or not, they prefer follow-up visits with a human doctor, as mediated through empathy. Study 2 finds that, regardless of the type of medical provider used, the anterior cingulate cortex shows greater activation in a highly (vs. low) personalized interaction, the activation of which is also correlated with consumers' willingness to revisit that provider. Furthermore, the temporal occipital fusiform cortex shows greater activation in consultations with a human doctor (vs. medical AI), regardless of the interaction's level of personalization.

The main condition and guarantee of obtaining accurate results is access to quality data through platforms such as Diia, HELSI, national education platforms, government banks, etc. The findings of the research suggest that wide implementation of AI/ML-based prediction technologies will allow the government in perspective to increase the efficiency of the use of budgetary resources, the effectiveness of the government target programs, improve the quality of public administration and to better satisfy the citizens’ demand. Future studies should be done to overcome the limitations of the approach: find a way to protect and extract sensitive information from government platforms, fight neural network bias, and create a more perfect system that is able to make multiparameter predictions and is also self-improving on the basis of the obtained results. © 2023 The Author(s).

"Problem definition: Online retailers provide recommendations of ancillary services when a customer is making a purchase. Our goal is to predict the net present value (NPV) of these services, estimate the probability of a customer subscribing to each of them depending on what services are offered to them, and ultimately prescribe the optimal personalized service recommendation that maximizes the expected long-term revenue. Methodology/results: We propose a novel method called cluster-while-classify (CWC), which jointly groups observations into clusters (segments) and learns a distinct classification model within each of these segments to predict the sign-up propensity of services based on customer, product, and session-level features. This method is competitive with the industry state of the art and can be represented in a simple decision tree. This makes CWC interpretable and easily actionable. We then use double machine learning (DML) and causal forests to estimate the NPV for each service and, finally, propose an iterative optimization strategy - -that is, scalable and efficient - -to solve the personalized ancillary service recommendation problem. CWC achieves a competitive 74% out-of-sample accuracy over four possible outcomes and seven different combinations of services for the propensity predictions. This, alongside the rest of the personalized holistic optimization framework, can potentially result in an estimated 2.5%-3.5% uplift in the revenue based on our numerical study. Managerial implications: The proposed solution allows online retailers in general and Wayfair in particular to curate their service offerings and optimize and personalize their service recommendations for the stakeholders. This results in a simplified, streamlined process and a significant long-term revenue uplift.

"As the fashion industry increasingly embraces artificial intelligence (AI), we investigate how a fast-fashion retailer should choose between using a manual design strategy or an AI-assisted design strategy to enhance existing products. A manual design is a traditional and basic approach that involves human designers only, whereas an AI-assisted design is a more innovative approach that involves both human designers and AI technologies. In this paper, the overall product enhancement is measured by two key attributes: product quality and product trendiness. Product quality can be measured by the product’s longevity as reflected by the quality of the materials and types of fabric and stitching used, where the product’s improvement level can be determined by the retailer in a continuous range. Consequently, the retailer may choose different levels of product quality under different design strategies. The two design approaches also lead to different natures of product trendiness, which is reflected by features such as styles, new materials, and colors, to name just a few. Specifically, we assume that the traditional manual design can predict well how trendy or popular the new product is. Hence, the trendiness attribute under the manual design is deterministic. However, given the uncertain nature of the AI-assisted design technology and the needed coordination between human designers and the adopted technologies, the trendiness of the new product designed under the AI-assisted approach is assumed uncertain. Two sets of designing costs are considered in product enhancement: the fixed design cost that is irrespective of the production volume and the variable marginal cost. Our analysis of the base model highlights the importance of decomposing different costs in determining the optimal design strategy. Specifically, the manual design is preferred when the fixed cost carries more weight, whereas the AI-assisted design is preferred when the marginal cost is a more important factor. Moreover, a higher level of innovation uncertainty under the AI-assisted design gives this strategy an advantage over the manual design. In our extended models, we demonstrate that (1) these results are robust even if the retailer does not have the flexibility to offer the existing product when the AI-assisted design is unpopular, and (2) the relative position of human designers in the two design approaches has an impact on the effects of these costs.

"Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has opened up many unprecedented opportunities in revolutionizing the digital marketing field. In this study, we designed a DRL-based personalized targeting strategy in a sequential setting. We show that the strategy is able to address three important challenges of sequential targeting: (1) forward looking (balancing between a firm's current revenue and future revenues), (2) earning while learning (maximizing profits while continuously learning through exploration-exploitation), and (3) scalability (coping with a high-dimensional state and policy space). We illustrate this through a novel design of a DRL-based artificial intelligence (AI) agent. To better adapt DRL to complex consumer behavior dimensions, we proposed a quantization-based uncertainty learning heuristic for efficient exploration-exploitation. Our policy evaluation results through simulation suggest that the proposed DRL agent generates 26.75% more long-term revenues than can the non-DRL approaches on average and learns 76.92% faster than the second fastest model among all benchmarks. Further, in order to better understand the potential underlying mechanisms, we conducted multiple interpretability analyses to explain the patterns of learned optimal policy at both the individual and population levels. Our findings provide important managerialrelevant and theory-consistent insights. For instance, consecutive price promotions at the beginning can capture price-sensitive consumers' immediate attention, whereas carefully spaced nonpromotional ""cooldown""periods between price promotions can allow consumers to adjust their reference points. Additionally, consideration of future revenues is necessary from a longterm horizon, but weighing the future too much can also dampen revenues. In addition, analyses of heterogeneous treatment effects suggest that the optimal promotion sequence pattern highly varies across the consumer engagement stages. Overall, our study results demonstrate DRL's potential to optimize these strategies' combination to maximize long-term revenues.  © 2022 INFORMS.",-1,10.1287/mnsc.2022.4621,"This study develops a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) strategy for personalized targeting in digital marketing, addressing challenges like revenue balance and scalability.

"Adding to the literature on the data-driven detection of bid-rigging cartels, we propose a novel approach based on deep learning (a subfield of artificial intelligence) that flags cartel participants based on their pairwise bidding interactions with other firms. More concisely, we combine a so-called convolutional neural network for image recognition with graphs that in a pairwise manner plot the normalized bids of some reference firm against the normalized bids of any other firms participating in the same tenders as the reference firm. Based on Japanese and Swiss procurement data, we construct such graphs for both collusive and competitive episodes (i.e when a bid-rigging cartel is or is not active) and we use a subset of graphs to train the neural network such that it learns distinguishing collusive from competitive bidding patterns. With the remaining graphs, we test the neural network's out-of-sample performance in correctly classifying collusive and competitive bidding interactions. We obtain a very decent average accuracy of around 95% or slightly higher when either applying the method within Japanese, Swiss, or mixed data (in which Swiss and Japanese graphs are pooled). When using data from one country for training to test the trained model's performance in the other country (i.e. transnationally), predictive performance decreases (likely due to institutional differences in procurement procedures across countries), but often remains satisfactorily high. All in all, the generally quite high accuracy of the convolutional neural network despite being trained in a rather small sample of a few 100 graphs points to a large potential of deep learning approaches for flagging and fighting bid-rigging cartels. © 2023 The Authors",-1,10.1016/j.ijindorg.2023.102946,"This paper proposes a deep learning approach to detect bid-rigging cartels by analyzing bidding interactions using convolutional neural networks.

"The adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) prediction of demand by a monopolist firm is examined. It is shown that, in the absence of AI prediction, firms face complex trade-offs in setting price and quantity ahead of demand that impact on the returns of AI adoption. Different industrial environments with differing flexibility of prices and/or quantity ex post also impact on AI returns as does the time horizon of AI prediction.

"Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the smart economic development (SED) patterns in Europe in relation to competitiveness. Motivational focus corresponds to global events: the fourth industrial revolution, transition to a low-carbon economy, economic shocks (such as the 2008 financial crisis, Brexit or the coronavirus pandemic), which requires rethinking development policies, targeting competitiveness increase and reducing imbalances in economic development. Design/methodology/approach: The analysis includes self-organising neural networks cluster analysis and correlations, comparative analysis of SED indicators structure and cumulative index estimation with World Economic Forum (WEF) global competitiveness index. The panel data set of 19 years from 2000 to 2018 for 30 European countries. Findings: Overall, cross-country examination suggests that European countries of higher competitiveness illustrate higher estimates in SED. The key determinants are juridical fairness, social responsibility, competence building, intelligence and welfare employment to develop smart patterns for reaching higher competitiveness. Research limitations/implications: The limitations relate to the particular sample of European countries and gathering statistical data and a methodology of the SED index calculation. In addition, the paper contains a macroeconomic environment focus on competitiveness estimation. Further research may be improved with micro and mezzo environment incorporation at a cross-country analysis level. Practical implications: By linking well-known terms of competitiveness and economic development with a concept of smartness, new approaches to policymaking emerged. The methodology presented in this paper has implications for territorial cohesion policies, competitiveness and branching strategies. The combination of SED sub-indexes and WEF GCI might aid a more accurate ex ante measurement.

When innovating in AI, collaboration with customers and competitors is critical, yet there are considerable risks associated with data sharing. Second, unique organisational challenges emerge during the diffusion of AI innovations, because adopting AI in an organisation not only results in the need for additional employee competencies but also challenges organisational power structures.

"Overview: The extent of knowledge available to society may no longer be limited by human cognition or by refining algorithms. Instead, the interaction of the two may limit knowledge transfer and creation. We examine two behavioral paradoxes: Polanyi’s paradox, which has existed since 1966, and the Trust paradox, which we propose. We study four technology innovations—printing, digitalization, the Internet, and artificial intelligence (AI)—and assess how these paradoxes limit the use of knowledge created by each innovation. We found that while technology has largely overcome Polanyi’s paradox of limiting the transfer of tacit knowledge, the Trust paradox may limit the application of AI-generated knowledge.

"Purpose: This paper aims to propose a model for democratization of Islamic home financing to tackle the issue of sustainability of homeownership affordability. Design/methodology/approach: A conceptual framework and fractional equity model (FEM) are developed to incorporate big data analytics, artificial intelligence and blockchain technology in an ecosystem for affordability and sustainability of homeownership via the proposed financing model. In addition, the FEM adopts the simulation approach to show its validity in terms of liquidity when compared with traditional home financing. In this regard, this paper is focused on developing and demonstrating the feasibility of a new financing model, rather than testing specific hypotheses or relationships. This is to propose the democratization model for Islamic Home Financing that will not benefit the prospective home buyers without compromising the profitability of the financial institutions. Findings: The findings indicate that the proposed end-to-end solution within the financing ecosystem can lead to more efficient matching market between the buyers and sellers of houses, reduced transaction costs, greater transparency and enhanced efficiency which in the end could lead to lower costs of owning homes and sustained financial resilience among house owners. The findings indicate that the FEM model is able to increase homeownership with more elements of liquidity, marketability and sustainability for homebuyers. Research limitations/implications: This research highlights the potential of big data and blockchain technology in democratizing Islamic home financing and evidence that the transfer of ownership is possible through tokenization.

"Purpose: This paper aims to determine priority issues in the corporate governance (CG) principles to increase CG rating notes of publicly traded companies. Design/methodology/approach: This study defines the priority issues for publicly traded companies that should be focused to increase the CG rating notes. In this context, this study considers the companies in Borsa Istanbul CG index (XKURY), use data for 2018, 2019, 2020, and applies machine learning algorithms. Findings: Overall, importance of each CG principle changes for the CG rating notes; first five CG principles in terms of significance have a total of 43.6% importance for the CG rating notes; following a straight-line approach in completing deficiencies of the CG principles cannot help increase the CG rating notes. Hence, empirical results highlight the impact of the most significant CG principles in terms of the CG rating notes that should be focused on by publicly traded companies so that CG ratings can be increased. Research limitations/implications: This study uses Turkey data and considers publicly traded companies in the XKURY index. The main cause of this condition is that consolidated data of compliance report format for all publicly traded companies cannot be obtained. Practical implications: The publicly traded companies can increase the CG rating notes by considering the results of this study while focusing on priority issues in the CG principles. Social implications: The study determines the most important CG principles that companies can focus on, highlights the importance of usage of machine learning algorithms in determining the most influential CG principles in terms of the CG rating notes and reflects on the difficulties for gathering consolidated CG principles compliance reporting data for all publicly traded companies.

"We are in an important technological moment in history, where experts in academia, research institutes, and non-governmental organizations posit that developments in artificial intelligence (ai) will lead to widespread disruptions in the labour market. This article addresses this claim by asking if organized labour sees ai as an equally imminent threat. Moreover, it asks how labour is preparing to challenge the power of capital as employers leverage automation in an age of neoliberal precarity. Online materials published by unions affiliated with the Canadian Labour Congress are reviewed here through discursive analysis. Our findings indicate that while no union has expressed opposition to technological change, many have questioned how employers leverage it in the workplace and its wider geopolitical and societal effects that affect their members and communities. We find that discussion around technological change emphasizes that technology makes work better and safer in a human-centred work environment. Overall, organized labour in Canada is attentive to issues within the political-economic context of automation, precarious work, community impacts, the role of government and regulation, skills and retraining, and job loss, among others. Given the view of technology held by organized labour, we challenge perspectives of both techno-pessimism and techno-optimism and highlight instead that labour unions are in a unique position to both respond and adapt to the evolution of work. Expanded strategic interventions around automation are needed to combat precarious work and the erosion of working conditions at present and in the coming decade(s), and we point to some notable efforts that are underway. © 2022 Athabasca University.

"The relevance of the paper is due to the digitalization of the economy and the introduction of artificial intelligence in production processes. This paper attempts to assess the effectiveness of artificial intelligence for the automation of production. Thus, the purpose of the work is to evaluate the effect of the introduction of artificial intelligence into automated process control systems. For this, an algorithm for implementing artificial intelligence was developed, i.e., procedures and their sequence were identified when implementing artificial intelligence in automated process control systems. The following procedures were considered: selection of implemented artificial intelligence functions, selection of an artificial intelligence system, selection of hardware implementation and acquisition of artificial intelligence, formation of tests for artificial intelligence training, implementation of artificial intelligence, and evaluation of results of implementing artificial intelligence. When implementing artificial intelligence, one should choose artificial intelligence based on neural networks with deep learning. The ambiguity of the cost estimate existed when selecting hardware due to the lack of data from developed artificial intelligence versions. This complicates the definition of capital expenditures. A formula for calculating costs of implementing artificial intelligence costs in automated process control systems is proposed. The introduction of artificial intelligence into an automated process control system will not provide significant savings.

"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to ascertain how corporate social responsibility (CSR) managers are justifying the adoption of automation technologies in India, which is simultaneously creating job loss. Design/methodology/approach: Indian firms to become and maintain superior levels of competitiveness in the marketplace had initiated the adoption, as well as usage of automation technologies such as robotics, additive manufacturing, machine learning and others. Such firm initiatives led to job loss in communities where the firm had a presence with its plants and offices. CSR managers primarily engaged with communities to undertake firm CSR initiatives. Job creation and its continuance have been a sacred component in this narrative. The adoption of automation technologies had altered this point of conversation. CSR managers had to justify both organizational actions from a firm perspective and reconcile the same to the community leaders. In this research, an exploratory study was conducted with a semi-structured open-ended questionnaire with 28 CSR experts. Data was collected through personal interviews and the data was content analysed based upon thematic content analysis. Findings: The results indicated that CSR managers rationalized the adoption of automation technologies from a push-pull-mooring (PPM) perspective from a firm centric point of view. While for justification from a community (social) centric perspective, dominantly system thinking with fair market ideology than normative justification, utilitarian rather than deontological thinking (DT) and organizational economic egoism (OEE) rather than reputational egoism was applied. Research limitations/implications: The study applies the theories of the PPM perspective from a firm centric point of view. While for community-based theoretical justification – system thinking with fair market ideology than normative justification, utilitarian rather than DT and OEE rather than reputational egoism was used.

"The buzz surrounding mass customisation technologies like 3D printing and artificial intelligence has many startups hoping to capitalise on this dream of creating personalised products at an affordable price, and well established companies scrambling to innovate and maintain their market share. However, the majority of them are failing as they struggle to answer one key question - where does customisation make sense? It only makes sense where people will pay for it. For products like prosthetics, mass customisation technologies can be highly beneficial. However, for products that already sell without a custom element, customisation is not a necessary feature, and so the product development team must figure out if the customers' perception of the added value of this feature will outweigh its premium price tag. This can be done through the use of a 'serious game,' whereby potential customers are given a limited budget to collaboratively buy and bid on potential features of the product, before it is developed. If the group choose to buy customisation over other features, then the product development team should implement it into their design. If not, the team should prioritise the features on which the customers have spent their budget. The level of customisation purchased can also be translated to an appropriate production method, for example, the most expensive type of customisation would likely be free-form design and could be achieved through digital fabrication, while a lower level could be achieved through short batch production. Twenty-eight teams of final year new product development students tested this methodology when bringing a product from concept through to prototype stage, and found that it allowed them to confidently prioritise their features based on how customers would likely spend their money. Where customers were likely to pay for customisation, the team could decide what level of customisation should be implemented and how it might be produced. A team using this methodology could easily replace mass customisation with another technology or theme that they would like to consider, like the sharing economy or the use of certain materials, to see how it would influence customers' spending. Finally, the results of the methodology can be aligned with the business goals of the company and even integrated into other lean and agile management concepts like the minimum viable product and product roadmaps. © Proceedings of the 14th European Conference on Innovation and Entrepreneurship, ECIE 2019.

In response to social media platforms mandating the disclosure of GenAI content, we investigate how followers perceive brands that use GenAI for content creation. Drawing from literature on algorithm aversion and brand authenticity, the results of three experimental studies indicate that brands' GenAI adoption induces negative attitudinal and behavioral follower reactions. These effects are mediated by followers' perceptions of brand authenticity and can be triggered by GenAI disclosure.

"Artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled voice assistants (VAs) are transforming firm-customer interactions but often come across as lacking empathy. This challenge may cause business managers to question the overall effectiveness of VAs in shopping contexts. Recognizing empathy as a core design element in the next generation of VAs and the limits of scenario-based studies in voice commerce, this article investigates how empathy exhibited by an existing AI agent (Alexa) may alter consumer shopping responses. AI empathy moderates the original structural model bridging functional, relational, and social-emotional dimensions. Findings of an individual-session online experiment show higher intentions to delegate tasks, seek decision assistance, and trust recommendations from AI agents perceived as empathic. In contrast to individual shoppers, families respond better to functional VA attributes such as ease of use when AI empathy is present. The results contribute to the literature on AI empathy and conversational commerce while informing managerial AI design decisions. © 2024 The Author(s)",-1,10.1016/j.jbusres.2024.114566,"This paper examines the role of empathy in AI-enabled voice assistants (VAs) and its effect on consumer shopping behavior.

"Purpose: The recent pandemic disrupted the way in which businesses transact with each other. In response to maintaining cleanliness in business-to-business (B2B) settings, artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled robots have been adopted as substitutes for cleaning personnel, yet their implications remain largely underexamined. This study aims to examine B2B buyer responses to cleaning information notices (human vs AI-enabled agent) placed at either the entry to the premises or the sales counter, thereby adding to the nascent literature in this line of inquiry. Design/methodology/approach: Three field experiments were conducted across diverse B2B businesses (wholesalers in Studies 1–2 and a commercial business in Study 3). To achieve greater empirical rigor and generalizability, this research used diverse stimuli across different B2B settings. In addition, the results ruled out alternate explanations and shed light upon political ideology as a boundary condition. Finally, a single-paper meta-analysis confirmed H1, consolidating the established effect. Findings: Featuring over 1,000 B2B buyers, the results show that politically liberal B2B buyers express greater preference for human over AI-performed cleaning while labor-orientated buyers are indifferent. Importantly, this effect is driven by greater relaxation associated with humans, which in turn, increases their future patronage and referral intent. Originality/value: The results enrich the collective knowledge of the adoption of AI-enabled robots, reinforcing for marketing practitioners and businesses that the reliance on human-based outcomes remains a preferred touchpoint in B2B settings, particularly for liberals. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",-1,10.1108/JBIM-03-2023-0126,"This study examines B2B buyer responses to cleaning notices from human versus AI-enabled agents in the context of the pandemic.

"Cybersecurity risk represents a growing business threat. However, little attention has been paid to its assessment. This study proposes a machine learning algorithm that considers firm cybersecurity risk disclosure, information technology governance, external monitoring by financial analysts and auditors, and general firm characteristics to estimate cybersecurity risk (i.e., the likelihood of a firm experiencing data breaches during a year). This measure outperforms the measure produced by logistic regression models, is higher in industries more prone to cyberattacks, and effectively predicts future data breaches and firm use of cybersecurity insurance policies. I also examine whether auditors consider firm cybersecurity risk in the engagement planning process, finding that, on average, a one-percentage-point increase in cybersecurity risk is associated with a 1.15 percent increase in audit fees. In addition, auditors charge a fee premium after a data breach only if the client has heightened cybersecurity risk.

"This study explores the factors influencing AI adoption in professional service firms. Grounded in the Technological-Organizational-Environmental (TOE) framework, we employed a qualitative, multiple case study approach, investigating three auditing firms of varying sizes through interviews and secondary document reviews. Our findings reveal six factors influencing AI adoption, including technology affordances and constraints, the firm's innovation management approaches and AI readiness, the competition environment, and the regulatory environment. Noteworthily, these factors vary significantly among the three firms. Larger firms, often operating in an environment with high AI penetration, primarily perceive the operating affordance of AI rather than marketing affordance. This means their AI adoption encompasses greater scale and depth than smaller firms. However, this expansive adoption exposes them to a widening gap in regulatory frameworks, hindering AI adoption. Moreover, smaller firms are characterized by weaker AI readiness, positioning them disadvantageously to mitigate the constraints imposed by AI.

"Artificial intelligence (AI) can perform core research tasks such as generating research questions, processing data, and solving problems. We shift the focus from AI as a “worker” to ask whether, how, and when AI can also “manage” human workers who perform such tasks. Focusing on the context of crowd science, we find examples of algorithmic management (AM) in five key functions highlighted in prior organizational literature: task division and task allocation, direction, coordination, motivation, and supporting learning. These applications benefit from the instantaneous, comprehensive, and interactive capabilities of AI, and reflect several more general underlying functions such as matching, clustering, and forecasting. Quantitative comparisons show that projects using AM are larger and more likely to be associated with platforms than projects not using AM, pointing to potentially important contingency factors.

"Ethical and governance issues regarding digital innovations developments like Artificial Intelligence have attracted abundant debate and research. Many perspectives – societal, engineering, research, management and policymaking – have been extensively analysed in an attempt to understand the role of the different stakeholders in minimising risks and amplifying opportunities. Interestingly, however, the investment community has been scarcely studied, despite the critical role of financing in technology innovation. This paper attempts to characterize investors' perceptions around the concept of digital innovation governance. We present insights derived from qualitative research using constructivist grounded theory, based on a series of interviews to 23 venture capital investment managers. Analysis of the data collected suggests several categories of important factors regarding how venture capital managers engage in Digital Innovation Governance (DIG): legitimacy of involvement, opportunity of conducting and capability to lead DIG initiatives in the invested startups. We offer a structured inventory of venture capital manager insights and perceptions on innovation governance.

"Adhering to long-termism is essential for sustaining and promoting corporate innovation in the face of future uncertainty. In this study, we use machine learning and text analysis methods to construct a proxy variable for managerial long-termism and explore how managerial long-termism affects corporate innovation using a sample of 13,117 firm-year observations from 2010 to 2020 in China.

"The introduction and widespread adoption of Artificial Intelligence in the professions has the potential to deliver a number of critical public goods, such as widening access to justice and healthcare through AI-powered professional services. Yet, the deployment of AI in the professions does not come without challenges, exemplified by the concerns about explainability, privacy, and human agency. In this paper, we explore how these issues may give rise to dark sides of AI in professional services and illustrate how an uncoordinated process of adoption and deployment can threaten the scope of AI-powered services. In particular, we illustrate how the adoption and deployment of AI in services may undermine the fiduciary duty between clients and professionals that, so far, has safeguarded the relationship between them, creating a ‘market for lemons’ of professional services.

"Purpose: The metaverse, through artificial intelligence (AI) systems and capabilities, allows considerable data analysis in the workplace, largely exceeding traditional people analytics data collection. While concerns over surveillance and issues associated with privacy and discrimination have been raised, the metaverse has the potential to offer opportunities associated with fairer assessment of employee performance and enhancement of the employee experience, especially with respect to gender and race, inclusiveness and workplace equity. This paper aims at shedding light on the diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) opportunities and challenges of implementing the metaverse in the workplace, and the role played by AI. Design/methodology/approach: This paper draws on our past research on AI and the metaverse and provides insights addressed to human resources (HR) scholars and practitioners. Findings: Our analysis of AI applications to the metaverse in the workplace sheds light on the ambivalent role of and potential trade-offs that may arise with this emerging technology. If used responsibly, the metaverse can enable positive changes concerning the future of work, which can promote DEI. Yet, the same technology can lead to negative DEI outcomes if implementations occur quickly, unsupervised and with a sole focus on efficiencies and productivity (i.e. collecting metrics, models etc.).

"How do shareholders respond to technologies hyped in general discourse, e.g., artificial intelligence (AI), if a common understanding is lacking and the technologies are still evolving? Do they respond primarily to substantive signals in technology announcements, such as AI capabilities, or do rhetorical signals also play a significant role? Adopting signalling theory as a theoretical lens, we conceptualise announcements of AI capabilities as substantive signals and linguistic elements in the announcements pertaining to organisational time horizon and risk-reward considerations as rhetorical signals. Departing from the typical focus on bijective relationships, we consider holistic, complex configurations of interdependent factors using the qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) methodology. Notably, announcements pertaining to AI capabilities are not necessarily associated with positive market reactions; in fact, when all three types of AI are included in announcements without explicit consideration of risks, shareholders react negatively. We find that shareholder response is based on joint evaluation of substantive and rhetorical signals, and that these signals interact in a complex way to produce positive and negative market reactions. These findings motivate several propositions for market reactions to IT announcements, providing implications for both theory and practice. © The Operational Research Society 2023.",-1,10.1080/0960085X.2023.2243892,"This paper examines shareholder responses to AI technology announcements, focusing on both substantive and rhetorical signals.

"SYNOPSIS: We investigate whether misstatement risk estimated using advanced machine learning techniques— hereafter, estimated misstatement risk (EMR)—approximates auditors’ risk assessments in practice. We find that auditors price EMR and auditor turnover is more likely to occur when EMR increases, indicating that EMR is associated with auditors’ risk assessment. We also find evidence that EMR is positively and significantly associated with audit fees and auditor switching for companies with Big N auditors but not for other companies, suggesting that Big N auditors are more responsive to risks captured by EMR. Additional analyses reveal that companies switching auditors when EMR increases are more likely to engage non-Big N auditors. Surprisingly, we find little evidence that the association between audit quality and EMR differs by auditor type. Our findings are consistent with the notion that the documented association between audit fees and EMR primarily reflects a risk premium in our setting. © 2022, American Accounting Association.

"Today's world revolves around technology, which has a total impact not only on human life but also on manufacturing companies. Many companies have embraced artificial intelligence (AI) in the form of powerful computers, applications, or software that can screen job applicants, alert when a machine is about to break down, and read legal contracts. However, the rapid expansion of AI and its use in legal settings, such as contract performance, in a company is a major challenge on the judicial side. This article, thus, establishes an evolutionary game model of whether manufacturing suppliers are performing contracts or not when the court chooses to use artificial intelligence (AI) technology. Considering the complexity of choosing manufacturers' AI strategy, the method constructs a simulation analysis model of manufacturers' contract enforcement behaviour with the participation of several subjects. We can simulate the influence of the factors selected on the strategy chosen by both parties (manufacturers and court) by changing the different influence factors and studying the evolutionary law of different court guidance and regulation strategies on the production behaviour of green products. The results show that the choice of the court and manufacturers to use the AI technology strategy or not is based on the rate of error reduction, through the computational implementation of multi-subject modelling. © 2022 Production Engineering Institute.

"The supply chain is a critical process involving farmers, buyers, suppliers, and many more entities. The entire system of farming and agriculture is based on it. The conventional method is very tedious and causes issues at multiple levels. AI and Blockchain are the two most used technologies nowadays. We are proposing an AI-enabled Blockchain ecosystem for the supply chain in Agriculture. A case study is given to explain the possibilities of the proposed model. The entire process of supply chain management has been transformed by artificial intelligence. AI plays a vital role in the warehousing process in collecting and analyzing information and inventory processes, enabling companies to increase efficiency and boost revenue. Precisely, AI predicts demand, modifying orders and rerouting products in transit. Major companies such as Google and Amazon have invested considerably in AI. Blockchain technology has been used in several areas, such as insurance, natural state, and securing personal information. Agriculture is one such field where Blockchain is being used extensively for the development and reformation of its various aspect. Unlike conventional, centralized and monopolistic agricultural management systems have been evolved. Blockchain provides a decentralized data structure to store and retrieve shared data with multiple un-trusted parties.

"The COVID-19 health crisis has drastically changed the lives of individuals around the world. The fear of infection, public guidelines, and a great deal of uncertainty resulted in a sharp decline in economic activity, disrupting global value chains and causing widespread job losses. Morocco, like the rest of the world, has experienced different changes in the job market. In this paper, we examine the effects of the pandemic on the Moroccan job market, focusing on which sectors and occupations were affected the most. Therefore, we analyze a 3-year-long collected dataset of job ads to understand the shifts that occurred in the job market. We use a variety of machine learning and text-mining techniques to process these ads. As part of our analysis, we classify those job ads according to the sector and the job title they mention.

"Over the past decade, robotic process automation (RPA) has emerged as a lightweight paradigm for automation in business enterprises, making automation more accessible to non-techie business users. In the industry, RPA vendors have not only provided out-of-the-box RPA bots to automate manual tasks on legacy software; they have also provided users a recorder to create their own bots for specialized tasks. However, if these recorders do not create generalizable bots, users risk facing a “bot sprawl” and governance problem. Building generalizable bots currently requires intervention from IT departments which are typically oversubscribed given their limited resources. Furthermore, the generalization process is typically long and tedious; it does not scale to cover the expansive needs of business users. We thus need a tool that can empower business users to act as citizen developers and build generalized bots themselves. In this work, we argue that the next generation of RPA bots must leverage artificial intelligence to learn from user interactions (through natural language or other modalities intuitive to citizen developers) and generalize to unseen settings. To achieve this, we first survey and assess the current state of the art in the RPA field for enabling citizen developers; and identify several key research challenges at the intersection of AI, RPA, and interactive task learning that must be addressed to realize the vision of RPA bots that continually learn new automation solutions from user interactions. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",-1,10.1007/978-3-031-16168-1_16,"This paper discusses the challenges of robotic process automation (RPA) and the need for AI-enhanced bots that can be developed by non-technical users.

"In the era of big data, data has gradually become a new production factor and plays a key role in the market competition. Therefore, lots of data resource in firms has been qualified to be recognized as assets. With the rise of digital economy, such “data assets” have been widely existed in different industries. Moreover, the national big data strategy was released at the Fifth Plenary Session of the 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in October 2015, which further highlights the growing importance of big data as a strategic asset on China′s development agenda. Therefore, data assets become increasingly important to firms in the digital economy. Firms with more information on data assets will help better assess the firm value, such as improving the accuracy of analysts′ forecasts. According to the relevant laws and regulations of information disclosure in China, data asset information disclosure is usually a voluntary off-balance-sheet information disclosure provided mostly in the form of text. In addition, with the implementation of the registration system of stock issuance in China′s A-share market, the importance of information intermediaries has also increased. Above all, this paper finds that it is necessary to investigate that whether more textual disclosure on data asset by firms can contribute to the forecast accuracy of analysts under the current situation. To be specific, this paper uses the China′s A-stock listed firms followed by analysts from 2010-2018 as the sample and builds the text dictionary by Word2Vec neural network algorithm for the text information mining to empirically study the impact of firms′ data assets information disclosure frequency on the coverage extent and accuracy with which analysts track and forecast their earnings. To further explain the above viewpoints, this paper investigates two potential channels for analysts applying data asset information in information processing. Finally, this paper further tests the influence of textual readability of firm information disclosure and the state of the market to the relationship between higher frequency of data asset disclosure and analysts′ forecast accuracy, respectively. In the first part, this paper begins with the investigation of whether higher frequency of data asset disclosure can attract more analyst coverage, and then tests the relationship between data asset disclosure frequency and earning forecast error of analysts. We find that the higher disclosure frequency of data assets information in the annual report of individual stocks, the more forecasting reports about next year′s earnings of the stocks from analysts, and the lower forecast error of the earnings level. These results indicate that analysts pay attention to data assets information, and data assets information disclosure can significantly improve the accuracy of analyst forecasts. In the second part, this research empirically finds that if firms lack voluntary earnings preannouncement behavior or poor lag earning information quality, the textual data asset disclosure of firms can be more helpful to improve analysts′ forecast accuracy. According to the results, data assets information disclosure can not only help provide forward-looking information, but also help increase the information transparency of firms. This paper provides evidence for the data asset disclosure to improve analysts′ forecast accuracy. In the third part, this paper attempts to further analyze some situations which may possibly influence the effects of data asset disclosure frequency on analysts′ forecast accuracy, such as textual readability in firms′ information disclosure and the state of the market (i. e. bull or bear market). This research finds that when the individual stock information provision shows higher readability, or the market is a bull market, the higher frequency of data assets information disclosure, the better analysts′ forecasts accuracy. In conclusion, with the rise of digital economy, the efforts of many firms aiming to break “isolated data island”, fully realize the data mining and facilitate data sharing make more and more data resource qualified to be recognized as assets. Hence, sufficient provision on data assets will contribute to completing the information environment of individual stocks, and further help promote analysts to better play the role of information intermediaries. This paper finds that more textual voluntary disclosure about data assets by firms can reduce forecast errors of analysts from multiple channels, which can support that analysts′ forecast has gradually paid attention to data asset information and efficient disclosure about data asset is obviously valuable to these information intermediaries. Besides, according to results shown in the study, textual information readability should be concerned for firms while providing data asset information, and analysts should appropriately apply data asset information considering the situation of bull and bear market. Above all, this paper holds that for individual stocks, the effort of providing and perfecting corporate textual information disclosure behavior on data asset is undoubtedly necessary, while for information intermediaries, such as analysts, should pay more attention to collecting and efficient processing of data assets information when making earnings forecasts in era of big data. © 2022, Journal of Industrial Engineering/ Engineering Management.

"Text produced by entrepreneurs represents a data source in entrepreneurship research on venture performance and fund-raising success. Manual text coding of single variables is increasingly assisted or replaced by computer-aided text analysis. Yet, for the development of prediction models with several variables, such dictionary-based text analysis methods are less suitable.

"In 2010, Jan Paulsson decried the use of party-appointed arbitrators in international arbitration as a ‘moral hazard’ that threatened the legitimacy of arbitration as an impartial method of dispute resolution. He suggested a series of reforms, most notably allowing arbitral institutions to make all arbitrator appointments. Over the past decade, commentators have debated Paulsson’s arguments and whether arbitrators should be chosen by parties or arbitral institutions, relying on an assumption that those two methods are the only ways by which arbitrators can be selected. This essay demonstrates that both approaches are fundamentally flawed, because they are subject to the self-interest and biases of human beings. Moreover, it explains how modern technology has produced a new way by which arbitrators can be selected–specifically, via artificial intelligence (AI)–that allows for parties to have input into the selection process but removes the issues that arise when parties select arbitrators directly. As this essay illustrates, using an AI to select arbitrators will allow arbitrators to truly be independent, ensure that arbitrators are selected for their merit and not for their connections, eliminate incentives for compromise awards and the use of dissents to communicate leanings to future appointing parties, and increase diversity in arbitrator appointments. © The Author(s) 2020.",-1,10.1093/ARBINT/AIAA033,"This essay critiques traditional methods of arbitrator selection in international arbitration and proposes using AI to enhance the selection process.

"The resurgence of artificial intelligence (AI) has empowered organizations to concentrate their research efforts on enhancing decision-making and automation capabilities. This is being pursued with the goal of increasing productivity, whilst reducing costs. With this, it is perceived that the jobs within these organizations that are considered subject to ‘routine’, or repetitive and mundane tasks, are more likely to be automatable. However, it may be recognised that these jobs are more than a simple set of routine tasks. This study aims to address the concept of routineness from the perspective of the job occupants themselves.

"The main goal of the article was to present the results of the process maturity assessment of organizations using artificial intelligence technology on the Israeli market. As a result of the theoretical study, an empirical gap was identified, resulting from the lack of studies addressing the issues of process maturity in organizations using artificial intelligence. The research question was constructed in the work. RQ: What is the level of process maturity of the organization on the Israeli market that has declared the implementation of artificial intelligence technology? Empirical proceedings were carried out on a sample of 19 non-probabilistically selected organizations functioning in Israel. The multi-dimensional process maturity assessment model (MMPM) was used to assess the level of implementation of process solutions, adjusted to the specificity of the given sector. The study used research methods, such as: quantitative and qualitative bibliometric analysis, survey and statistical methods. The first chapter presents the results of the quantitative and qualitative bibliometric analysis. Then, the next chapter characterized the concept of process maturity and described the applied MMPM methodology. The third chapter describes the population of the surveyed organizations on the Israeli market. The next chapter presents the detailed results of the empirical proceedings. The last chapter contains the study results and discussion.

"Purpose: The service industry is facing the huge impact of digital transformation, in which artificial intelligence (AI) plays one of the most important roles. This study aims to expand the understanding of the AI acceptance framework and confirm whether consumers’ digital skills have a moderating effect on the research model. Design/methodology/approach: Hypotheses were tested using a data set of 1,641 individuals. Partial least squares structural equation modeling and multi-group analysis were used to estimate the model. Findings: The results indicate that antecedent factors influence consumers’ willingness to use AI devices in services. The two groups of different digitally savvy respondents differ because the influence of anthropomorphism, social influence and hedonic motivation on respondents’ perceived efforts to use AI devices in service delivery depends on respondents’ digital skills. Originality/value: The novel contribution of this study is reflected in a comprehensive model that explains the moderating effect of individual digital skills on willingness to use AI devices.

"Purpose: This paper aims to explore the matching effect of hospitality brand image (cool vs non-cool) and service agents (Artificial intelligence [AI] vs human staff) on brand attitude, with a focus on assessing the role of feeling right as a mediator and service failure as a moderator. Design/methodology/approach: This paper tested the hypotheses through three experiments and a Supplementary Material experiment, which collectively involved 835 participants. Findings: The results indicated that the adoption of AI by cool brands can foster the right feeling and enhance consumers’ positive brand attitudes. In contrast, employing human staff did not lead to improved brand attitudes toward non-cool brands. Furthermore, the study found that service failure moderated the matching effect between service agents and cool brand images on brand attitude. The matching effect was observed under successful service conditions, but it disappeared when service failure occurred. Practical implications: The findings offer practical guidance for hospitality companies in choosing service agents based on brand image. Cool brands can swiftly transition to AI, reinforcing their modern, cutting-edge image. Traditional brands may delay AI adoption or integrate it strategically with human staff.

"Catastrophe insurance is an important element of disaster management. Yet the historical presence of inequalities in insurance, from redlining to pricing disparity, has had a devastating impact on minority communities. Whereas the fairness of insurance ratemaking is studied in general, we identify a unique challenge for catastrophe insurance that sets it apart from other lines of insurance. Drawing upon the recent advances in machine learning for fair data valuation, we reveal striking connections between the two seemingly unrelated problems and lean on insights from machine learning to mathematically and empirically study the fairness of ratemaking methods for catastrophe insurance. Our results indicate the potential existence of disparate impact against minorities across existing methods and point to a unique mathematical solution that can satisfy a few commonly assumed properties of fair ratemaking for catastrophe insurance.

"Digital technologies are revolutionizing operations across various industries, including the sports sector. This study employed a mixed methods approach to investigate technology adoption rates and assess the perceived impacts on performance, injuries, operations, and fan experience in 21 sports organizations. Furthermore, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 17 industry experts, providing information on decision drivers, implementation challenges, emerging innovations, and ethical considerations associated with responsible technology integration. The survey findings revealed extensive usage of analytics, wearables, management information systems, and fan engagement platforms among the sports organizations under investigation. Notably, analytics and statistics tools, along with management information systems, were identified as having the most significant influence on enhancing organizational performance and efficiency. Wearable technologies emerged as crucial tools for injury prevention through the monitoring of athlete health metrics. Insights gleaned from the expert interviews underscored the potential of emerging technologies, such as augmented reality, athlete tracking, predictive analytics, exoskeletons, and AI coaching, in the sports industry. However, experts also highlighted implementation challenges, including financial considerations, skills gaps, resistance to change, uncertainties surrounding return on investment demonstration, and ethical risks that necessitate mitigation measures. The study results indicated that data-driven systems have the capacity to improve operations and athlete outcomes; however, an over-reliance on such systems may diminish the significance of human expertise.

"This paper explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) to substitute for human participants in market research. Such LLMs can be used to generate text given a prompt. We argue that perceptual analysis is a particularly promising use case for such automated market research for certain product categories. The proposed new method generates outputs that closely match those generated from human surveys: agreement rates between human-and LLM-generated data sets reach over 75%. Moreover, this applies for perceptual analysis based on both brand similarity measures and product attribute ratings. The paper demonstrates that, for some categories, this new method of fully or partially automated market research will increase the efficiency of market research by meaningfully speeding up the process and potentially reducing the cost. Further results also suggest that with an ever larger training corpus applied to large language models, LLM-based market research will be applicable to answer more nuanced questions based on demographic variables or contextual variation that would be prohibitively expensive or infeasible with human respondents. © 2024 INFORMS.",-1,10.1287/mksc.2023.0454,"This paper examines the use of large language models (LLMs) as substitutes for human participants in market research, particularly for perceptual analysis.

"Purpose: This study aims to explore the mediating effect of digital options on the relationship between emerging information technology investments (ITIs) and firm performance (FP). In particular, it analyses the performance impacts of investments in five emerging technologies of IT or non-IT firms. Design/methodology/approach: Secondary data are collected from Chinese A-share listed companies from 2010 to 2018. The authors propose an econometric model focusing on the impact of ITIs on a firm’s market value and profit. A propensity score matching model is applied to control endogeneity. Findings: The ITIs’ effect on FP is found to be completely mediated by digital options, and the reach of digital options plays a more positive role in the relationship between ITIs and Tobin’s Q, whereas the richness of digital options is stronger between ITIs and return on net assets (ROE). The group study shows that the impact of process technologies such as cloud computing and the Internet of Things has a more profound impact on Tobin’s Q, and the knowledge technologies represented by artificial intelligence, blockchain and big data strongly affect ROE. In addition, the positive relationship between ITIs and FP is unrelated to IT/non-IT firms. Research limitations/implications: First, the data are based on 219 publicly announced emerging ITIs in China and thus may not be generalizable to other cultural/national contexts. Second, there is a lack of a large sample data set of emerging ITI information in China, and the duration of this study is constrained to the relatively short rise of emerging technologies. Practical implications: This study provides firm decision-makers with practical implications. The results imply that the effect of ITIs on FP depends on digital options, so both IT firms (e.g., Big Tech giants) and non-IT firms (e.g., incumbents) should discover how to balance firm value and profit in their management of emerging technology investment projects with digital options thinking. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first empirical study to investigate the relationship between ITIs and FP from the perspective of digital options, exploring five emerging technologies and considering firm life, size, and state ownership in a sample of Chinese listed firms. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",-1,10.1108/CMS-09-2022-0335,"This study examines the mediating effect of digital options on the relationship between investments in emerging information technologies and firm performance.

"Data resources empower traditional inputs and promote capacity utilisation. Previous research has proven the positive role of digitisation on capacity utilisation from the perspectives of information asymmetry and technological innovation, but there is still a lack of theoretical foundation. This study proposes a model of the impact of information and communications technology capital on capacity utilisation. We empirically test the relationship between firms' digital investments and capacity utilisation using the data of Chinese manufacturing-listed companies from 2007 to 2021. First, an inverted U-shaped feature exists between firm digital investments and capacity utilisation, and the main mechanisms are the ‘cost effect’, ‘capital allocation effect’ and ‘labour input effect’. Second, firms' bargaining power, industrial technology density and regional market development influence capacity utilisation when firms engage in digital investments. Third, narrowing the digital gaps within industries and regions and increasing investments in artificial intelligence, big data and digital technology applications can enhance the non-linear impact of firm digitisation on capacity utilisation. Fourth, digital transformation can resist the negative impact of external shocks on capacity utilisation to some extent.

"In recent years, algorithmic management practices have been widely adopted by employers to monitor remote work, analyse how applicants behave during job interviews, rate worker performance and calculate wage adjustments. As a result, the condition of workers being subjected to the upstream authority of managers has intensified. Employment protection legislation recognizes the importance of curbing the employer’s unilateral discretionary power by deploying several controlling factors. However, the traditional guardrails have now been displaced by the transformative impact of data-driven technologies. As a response to this challenge, several measures implemented by the European Union (EU) could be pragmatically adapted to curtail the expansion of artificial intelligence-based management prerogative. By applying a multidimensional, anticipatory and participatory approach, this paper integrates substantive and procedural rules that contribute to rebalancing informational asymmetries within workplaces and assesses the effectiveness of these rules. Examining case law, administrative decisions and legislative developments, it also discusses the mutually reinforcing relationship between data protection and anti-discrimination measures, which renders automated decisions documentable and contestable.

"Processing large and heterogeneous numbers of ideas submitted to crowdsourcing contests is a regular challenge for idea evaluators. The aim of this study is to investigate a potential use case for AI-based innovation management and to extend the knowledge of using automated novelty detection in idea evaluation processes. AI-based language models can automatically allocate short texts according to their semantic similarity in an embedded space. We represent the semantic content of crowdsourced ideas with the three contemporary text embeddings–Doc2Vec, SBERT, and GPT-3-based Ada Similarity–and compute their semantic distance to different reference sets using different novelty detection algorithms. We then compare the algorithm-generated scores with human novelty assessments to validate them. While selected novelty scores based on text embeddings correlate with humans, our results show that scores based on SBERT embeddings best match human novelty assessments. We also find that AI-based novelty detection approaches perform better for ideas below the median word count and when compared to a set of existing solutions, suggesting that the chosen language model is not the only factor influencing the applicability of the proposed approach.

"The adoption of the circular economy (CE) requires new strategies and policies to help firms in their transition. Despite this need, research on how to articulate policies for the transition towards a CE is still in its early stages, and the findings are inconclusive and even discrepant, especially concerning the necessary financial support or policies to foster systemic circular innovation in firms. The aim of this research is to analyze the effect of institutional pressures in these two areas on the adoption of CE in firms. To do this, from a theoretical perspective, we combine institutional theory, particularly institutional complexity, with the dynamic capabilities approach. From a methodological point of view, along with classical econometric methods, artificial neural networks and regression trees are applied to analyze data from European firms. The results show, first, that policies to foster innovation and financial support help in the adoption of CE in firms, but its effect follows an inverted U shape. This indicates that the institutional pressures embodied in these policies reach a threshold and that beyond that point, an increase in institutional pressures deteriorates the development of CE in firms. Second, the results show that within the portfolio of institutional pressures considered, there is a positive effect of a greater diversity of policies on CE development in firms. Lastly, the results demonstrate that innovation policies, when combined with financial policies produce synergistic effects on the adoption of CE in firms, greater than those observed when financial support policies are employed in isolation.  © 1988-2012 IEEE.",-1,10.1109/TEM.2023.3286953,"This paper analyzes the effect of institutional pressures on the adoption of the circular economy (CE) in firms, using econometric methods alongside artificial neural networks and regression trees.

Despite distinctive progress being made in PPP projects to reduce their failure probability, there is no proper and effective framework to predict PPP project failure in advance in either developing or in developed countries. The present study aims to develop a machine learning (ML) model to predict the failure of PPP projects to prosper in adverse conditions. This research addresses two critical issues, i.e., class imbalance and interpretability of ML models, that differentiate the current study from data-driven studies to date. First, existing studies usually focused on comparing and selecting the most adequate ML methods, but this study distinctively compared the performances of nine data resampling algorithms. Besides, in order to enhance the interpretability and visibility of the proposed model, a game theory-based feature investigation algorithm, Shapley additive explanations (SHAP), was used to identify not only the most significant features, but also the conditions of the features that cause failure or success in PPP projects. The findings illustrate that the proposed model yielded the highest prediction performance once the data set was resampled with the support vector machine-synthetic minority oversampling technique (SVM-SMOTE). SHAP analysis further shows that unsolicited proposals, domestic credit to the private sector, and project type/subtype have significant impacts on the prediction rationale. Overall, this study contributes to theory through incorporating resampling methods and SHAP algorithm into ML models as well as to practice with an advanced and reliable model to predict the status of PPP projects. The data-driven model and findings are expected to respond to current policy and industry needs by proposing a robust decision-making input for detecting risky PPP projects, allocating resources more effectively based on the most critical failure factors, and promoting the transparency of PPP project outcomes.  © 2023 American Society of Civil Engineers.",-1,10.1061/JMENEA.MEENG-5492,"This paper develops a machine learning model to predict the failure of public-private partnership (PPP) projects, addressing issues of class imbalance and model interpretability.

"Purpose: Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) of the U.S. government ensures that all health and safety regulations, protecting the workers, are enforced. OSHA officers conduct inspections and assess fines for non-compliance and regulatory violations. Literature discussion on the economic impact of OSHA inspections with COVID-19 related citations for the construction sector is lacking. This study aims to investigate the relationships between the number of COVID-19 cases, construction employment and OSHA citations and it further evaluates the total and monthly predicted cost impact of OSHA citations associated with COVID-19 violations. Design/methodology/approach: An application of multiple regression analysis, a supervised machine learning linear regression model, based on K-fold cross validation sampling and a probabilistic risk-based cost estimate Monte Carlo simulation were utilized to evaluate the data. The data were collected from numerous websites including OSHA, Centers for Disease Control and the World Health Organization. Findings: The results show that as the monthly construction employment increased, there was a decrease in OSHA citations. Conversely, the cost impact of OSHA citations had a positive relationship with the number of COVID-19 cases. In addition, the monthly cost impact of OSHA COVID-19 related citations along with the total cost impact of citations were predicted and analyzed. Originality/value: The application of the two models on cost analysis provides a thorough comparison of predicted and overall cost impact, which can assist the contractors to better understand the possible cost ramifications. Based on the findings, it is suggested that the contractors include contingency fees within their contracts, hire safety managers to implement specific safety protocols related to COVID-19 and request a safety action plan when qualifying their subcontractors to avoid potential fines and citations. © 2022, Hooman Sadeh, Claudio Mirarchi, Farzad Shahbodaghlou and Alberto Pavan.",-1,10.1108/ECAM-10-2021-0953,"This study investigates the economic impact of OSHA citations related to COVID-19 in the construction sector, using multiple regression analysis and machine learning models.

"Capturing valuable product/service improvement ideas is helpful for the development of new features. However, the existing methods for capturing such improvement ideas have the disadvantages of high cost, long time lag, information overload, and difficulty in getting a response. We propose an innovative framework based on lead user theory for capturing product/service improvement ideas from user-generated content on social media (henceforth called “chatter”). To identify the chatter containing improvement ideas, we design a machine-learning-based imbalanced classification model. Additionally, we use text summarization technology to get a rough sense of improvement ideas from the selected chatter. We validate the proposed framework by a case study in the automotive industry.

"The number and the diversity in nature of daily cyber-attacks have increased in the last few years, and trends show that both will grow exponentially in the near future. Critical Infrastructures (CI) operators are not excluded from these issues; therefore, CIs’ Security Departments must have their own group of IT specialists to prevent and respond to cyber-attacks. To introduce more challenges in the existing cyber security landscape, many attacks are unknown until they spawn, even a long time after their initial actions, posing increasing difficulties on their detection and remediation. To be reactive against those cyber-attacks, usually defined as zero-day attacks, organizations must have Threat Hunters at their security departments that must be aware of unusual behaviors and Modus Operandi. Threat Hunters must face vast amounts of data (mainly benign and repetitive, and following predictable patterns) in short periods to detect any anomaly, with the associated cognitive overwhelming. The application of Artificial Intelligence, specifically Machine Learning (ML) techniques, can remarkably impact the real-time analysis of those data. Not only that, but providing the specialists with useful visualizations can significantly increase the Threat Hunters’ understanding of the issues that they are facing. Both of these can help to discriminate between harmless data and malicious data, alleviating analysts from the above-mentioned overload and providing means to enhance their Cyber Situational Awareness (CSA).

"Purpose: Digital technology is increasingly important in enhancing organizational agility (OA). Institutional theory and resource-based view were harmonized to analyze firms' adoption of digital technologies. However, previous studies on OA have revealed that external pressures imply the imposition of barriers or technological standards that ultimately restrict OA. This study employs this double theoretical lens to investigate the mediation role of business analytics capability (BAC) in the relationship between co-innovation (CO), i.e. open innovation in digital platforms, and OA, as well as the negative moderating effect of external pressure for artificial intelligence adoption (EPAIA) on this mediation. Design/methodology/approach: Structural equation modeling was used to test the moderated mediation with survey data from 229 firms. Findings: The main result indicates that 72% of OA variance is explained by the effect of CO that is transmitted by the mediator (BAC). However, contrary to the authors' expectations, EPAIA only has a positive moderating effect along the path between BAC and OA. Originality/value: This work contradicts the prevalent notion of the negative consequences of external pressures for artificial intelligence adoption. Specifically, this study's findings refute the notion that institutional pressures are the source of technical problems that disrupt CO and BAC integration and reduce OA. In contrast, the unexpectedly positive effect of EPAIA may indicate that this type of external pressure can be viewed as a significant sign and an opportunity for the company to adopt the industry's most advanced and effective digital transformation practices. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",-1,10.1108/BPMJ-10-2022-0484,"This study examines the relationship between co-innovation, business analytics capability, and organizational agility, while also considering the moderating effect of external pressures on AI adoption.

"Human managers are increasingly challenged by artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in performing managerial functions. We undertook a field experiment that used AI vis-à-vis human managers to perform structured, data-intensive evaluations of employee performance. We generate two sets of insights. First, employees considered AI to be both fairer and more accurate in evaluating their performance than the average human manager. Second, to catch up with AI, human managers’ fairness perceived by employees played a first-order role by (a) helping human managers, to a greater extent than those managers’ evaluation accuracy, to close the performance gap of the employees evaluated by them compared with that of those evaluated by AI, and (b) constraining the effect of human managers’ perceived accuracy of evaluations on employees’ performance.

"Purpose: This paper aims to understand what prevents established law firms from embracing digitalization and discusses barriers to solving the emerging ambidexterity problem. Law firms have been organized in the same way for decades. However, digital opportunities are emerging and new competitors are challenging established firms. This presents established law firms with an ambidexterity problem: How can law firms simultaneously uphold their successful way of working while entering a new world of digitalization, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning? Design/methodology/approach: Previous research suggests that law firms are slow in digital transformation, compared to other Professional Service Firms (PSFs). In this paper, the authors explore why this happens. Interview data from representatives in law firms are complemented with data from architects as well as legal industry data and field notes. The data have been analyzed to spot patterns and emerging themes. Findings: The authors find that established law firms face structural and cultural barriers to applying ambidextrous solutions. When comparing law firms with architecture firms, the authors see that while established architecture firms have combined digital exploration with ongoing exploitation, established law firms have focused on exploitation, leaving digital exploration to new legal tech firms. This difference can be attributed to industry context and professional culture.

"The benefits of additive manufacturing (AM) extend beyond the attributes of physical products and production processes they enable. Experience with AM can augment the way design is approached and can increase opportunities to pivot toward less familiar design tasks. We begin this qualitative study with a natural experiment made possible by an exogenous shock: the COVID-19 pandemic. Through a three-stage case study approach using a grounded theory-building method, we contrast AM usage among a set of firms, half of which pivoted their resources away from their traditional production and toward a response to this shock. We engage in an abductive reasoning approach to consider common threads in AM capabilities that facilitated this pivoting. Our analyses suggest that the advanced use of generative design (GD), a category of computational technologies enabling novel and optimized design, is a critical attribute of these firms that ended up pivoting to make COVID-related products. Specifically, firms with experience applying this capability demonstrated a unique ability to pivot during this shock and emphasized their valuation of AM-enabled agility. We revisited these firms 2 years after initial contact and found that GD was associated with higher levels of innovation and was largely viewed by designers as a mechanism driving double-loop learning. Overall, our study provides insights into the symbiosis between human and artificially intelligent GD, and the role of such symbiosis in advancing AM capabilities. © 2023 The Authors.

"Multi-access edge computing (MEC) is a key enabler to fulfill the promises of a new generation of immersive and low-latency services in 5G and Beyond networks. MEC represents a defining function of 5G, offering significant computational power at a reduced latency, allowing to augment the capabilities of user equipments while preserving their battery life. However, the demands generated by a plethora of innovative and concurrent IT services requiring high quality of service and quality of experience levels will likely overwhelm the—albeit considerable—resources available in 5G and Beyond scenarios. To take full advantage of its potential, MEC needs to be paired with innovative resource management solutions capable of effectively addressing the highly dynamic aspects of the scenario and of properly considering the heterogeneous and ever-changing nature of next generation IT services, prioritizing the assignment of resources in a highly dynamic and contextual fashion.

In light of the ever-increasing volume of tax returns and tax documentation to be processed, the digital transformation of the administration has become an imperative. Yet, cases such as system risico indicatie (SyRI), the toeslagenaffaire and eKasa show that automation poses risks to taxpayers. These cases cast doubts on the secretive nature of the tax administration’s prerogatives and the information and communications technology (ICT) tools used to perform its missions, begging the question of what lies behind the administrations’ one-way mirror.

"Due to the influence of diversified market demand and artificial intelligence, the retail industry has seen a new revolution in 2016, which is the familiar ""new retail"". Artificial intelligence, as the technological soul of new retail and the future technological dividend of the retail industry, has been integrated into new retail. In the future, with the help of artificial intelligence, the development of new retail lies in opening up all links of the supply chain and enabling data sharing in all links. New retail creates new links between producers, retailers, customers and other stakeholders, so as to reduce costs and increase efficiency, disrupt experience, and add more business value. This article starts from the background of the birth of the new retail model and the transformation of traditional retail, and analyzes the financial management model of traditional retail enterprises after transformation. At the same time, this article combines the characteristics of the new retail industry to propose a thinking model for the transition from accounting accounting to management accounting.

"Purpose: An important but neglected area of investigation in digital entrepreneurship is the combined role of both core and peripheral members of an emerging technological field in shaping the symbolic and social boundaries of the field. This is a serious gap as both categories of members play a distinct role in expanding the pool of resources of the field. I address this gap by exploring how membership category is related to funding decisions in the emerging field of artificial intelligence (AI). Design/methodology/approach: The first quantitative study involved a sample of 1,315 AI-based startups which were founded in the period of 2011–2018 in the United States. In the second qualitative study, the author interviewed 32 members of the field (core members, peripheral members and investors) to define the boundaries of their respective role in shaping the social boundaries of the AI field. Findings: The author finds that core members in the newly founded field of AI were more successful at attracting funding from investors than peripheral members and that size of the founding team, number of lead investors, number of patents and CEO approval were positively related to funding. In the second qualitative study, the author interviewed 30 members of the field (core members, peripheral members and investors) to define their respective role in shaping the social boundaries of the AI field. Research limitations/implications: This study is one of the first to build on the growing literature in emerging organizational fields to bring empirical evidence that investors adapt their funding strategy to membership categories (core and peripheral members) of a new technological field in their resource allocation decisions. Furthermore, I find that core and peripheral members claim distinct roles in their participation and contribution to the field in terms of technological developments, and that although core members attract more resources than peripheral members, both actors play a significant role in expanding the field’s social boundaries. Practical implications: Core AI entrepreneurs who wish to attract funding may consider operating in fewer categories in order to be perceived as core members of the field, and thus focus their activities and limited resources to build internal AI capabilities. Entrepreneurs may invest early in filing a patent to signal their in-house AI capabilities to investors. Social implications: The social boundaries of an emerging technological field are shaped by a multitude of actors and not only the core members of the field. The author should pay attention to the role of each category of actors and build on their contributions to expand a promising field.

"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is poised to revolutionize all aspects of business, particularly new-product development (NPD). Currently, our approach to NPD has remained largely unchanged for decades, yielding stubbornly poor results: only 30% of NP development projects become commercial successes. However, the AI revolution is set to alter this landscape significantly! Leading early adopter firms demonstrate that AI not only finds many applications in NPD but also offers substantial payoffs, such as 50% reductions in development times. This article provides an outline of the diverse and powerful applications of AI in NPD, offering numerous examples from leading companies. Examples include GE's use of digital models and twins to quickly test product designs in turbine development; BASFs use of AI to identify new molecules for use in customer formulations; and AI to generate new-product ideas, identify new-product opportunities, and even create new-product concepts. Our exploratory journey begins at the idea stage and traverses the entire new-product process to the postlaunch period. While AI might still resemble science fiction to many, that future is no longer fiction-it is here now. AI has arrived in full force!

"This paper investigates the deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the Swedish Public Employment Service (PES), focusing on the concept of trustworthy AI in public decision-making. Despite Sweden's advanced digitalization efforts and the widespread application of AI in the public sector, our study reveals significant gaps between theoretical ambitions and practical outcomes, particularly in the context of AI's trustworthiness. We employ a robust theoretical framework comprising Institutional Theory, the Resource-Based View (RBV), and Ambidexterity Theory, to analyze the challenges and discrepancies in AI implementation within PES. Our analysis shows that while AI promises enhanced decision-making efficiency, the reality is marred by issues of transparency, interpretability, and stakeholder engagement. The opacity of the neural network used by the agency to assess jobseekers’ need for support and the lack of comprehensive technical understanding among PES management contribute to the challenges in achieving transparent and interpretable AI systems. Economic pressures for efficiency often overshadow the need for ethical considerations and stakeholder involvement, leading to decisions that may not be in the best interest of jobseekers. We propose recommendations for enhancing AI's trustworthiness in public services, emphasizing the importance of stakeholder engagement, particularly involving jobseekers in the decision-making process.

"Drawing on real options and resource dependence theories, this study examines how firms adjust their innovation investments to address trade policy effect uncertainty (TPEU), a type of firm-specific, perceived environmental uncertainty capturing managers' difficulty in predicting the impacts of potential policy changes on business operations. To develop a context-dependent, time-varying measure of TPEU, we apply bidirectional encoder representations from transformers, an advanced deep learning technique. We analyze the texts of mandatory management discussion and analysis sections of annual reports from 3181 publicly listed Chinese firms. Our sample comprises 22,669 firm-year observations spanning the years 2007 to 2019. The econometric analyses show that firms experiencing higher TPEU will reduce innovation investments. This effect is stronger for firms facing lower competition, involving more foreign sales, and not owned by the state. These findings provide clarity on previously inconclusive results by showcasing the significant influence of policy effect uncertainty, as opposed to policy state uncertainty, on firms' decisions regarding innovation investments.

"Purpose: Disinformation, false information designed with the intention to mislead, can significantly damage organizational operation and reputation, interfering with communication and relationship management in a wide breadth of risk and crisis contexts. Modern digital platforms and emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), introduce novel risks in crisis management (Guthrie and Rich, 2022). Disinformation literature in security and computer science has assessed how previously introduced technologies have affected disinformation, demanding a systematic and coordinated approach for sustainable counter-disinformation efforts. However, there is a lack of theory-driven, evidence-based research and practice in public relations that advises how organizations can effectively and proactively manage risks and crises driven by AI (Guthrie and Rich, 2022). Design/methodology/approach: As a first step in closing this research-practice gap, the authors first synthesize theoretical and technical literature characterizing the effects of AI on disinformation. Upon this review, the authors propose a conceptual framework for disinformation response in the corporate sector that assesses (1) technologies affecting disinformation attacks and counterattacks and (2) how organizations can proactively prepare and equip communication teams to better protect businesses and stakeholders. Findings: This research illustrates that future disinformation response efforts will not be able to rely solely on detection strategies, as AI-created content quality becomes more and more convincing (and ultimately, indistinguishable), and that future disinformation management efforts will need to rely on content influence rather than volume (due to emerging capabilities for automated production of disinformation). Built upon these fundamental, literature-driven characteristics, the framework provides organizations actor-level and content-level perspectives for influence and discusses their implications for disinformation management.

"Host-generated property images as a visual channel reveal substantial information about properties. Selecting proper images to display can lead to higher demand and increased rental revenue. In this paper, we define, estimate, and optimize the impacts of Airbnb photos on customers’ renting decisions. We apply ResNet-50, a convolutional neural network model, to build two separate, supervised learning models to evaluate the image quality and room types posted by Airbnb hosts. Then, we characterize the overall impacts of photo layout by the room type featured in the photo, photo quality, and order of display on the listings’ web pages. To address two estimation challenges in the Airbnb setting, namely, censored demand and changing consideration sets, we propose a novel pairwise comparison model that utilizes customers’ booking sequence data to consistently estimate the impact of photo layout on customers’ renting decisions. Our estimation results suggest that the cover image has a significantly larger impact than noncover photos and a high-quality bedroom cover image leads to the largest increase in demand. Furthermore, we build a nonlinear integer programming optimization problem and develop an algorithm to determine the optimal photo layout. Our counterfactual analysis suggests that a listing’s unilateral adoption of optimal photo layout leads to 11.0% more bookings on average. Moreover, depending on the neighborhood and market size, when listings simultaneously switch to the optimal photo layout, they get booked for two to five additional days in a year on average, which boosts revenue by $500 to $1,100. © 2022 INFORMS.",-1,10.1287/mnsc.2022.4616,"This paper examines the impact of Airbnb property images on rental decisions, utilizing a convolutional neural network (ResNet-50) to evaluate image quality and room types.

"Decision biases reinforce firms’ tendency to develop innovations based on narrow economic motivations. Consequently, sustainability-oriented ideas explicitly targeting social and environmental issues are easily discarded in idea selection when trade-offs between economic and sustainability values are faced. Given the so far limited knowledge about how sustainability-oriented ideas are developed and selected in organizations today, this research aims to explore how managerial biases affect selection of sustainability-oriented ideas in internal crowdsourcing. It does so through an empirical study drawing on data collected from a Swedish multinational company using internal crowdsourcing for different types of innovation ideas. The empirical study explicitly identifies sustainability-oriented ideas based on machine learning and captures managerial biases for ideas based on sentiment analysis. Regression analyses reveal that managerial biases potentially affect the selection of sustainability-oriented ideas through the mediating role of managerial attention in idea development. Furthermore, this mediating relationship is moderated by search pattern in terms of directed search.

As the use of AI creates new risks hitherto unknown from an Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) perspective, the question is whether the proposed EU regulations address these risks. The starting point for further consideration should be an analysis of the proposed changes to EU law in the context of the general principles of labour law. In addition to proposals to amend EU law on artificial intelligence, this article examines current occupational safety and health legislation. Issues related to occupational safety and health monitoring of employers using artificial intelligence were also the subject of the study. The social sciences' perception of human labour is not insignificant in assessing the new relationship at the employer-AI-employee level. The proposed model for regulating AI by the EU legislator is insufficient. First and foremost, there is no clear indication of the employer's obligations towards employees concerning occupational health and safety. Certainly, the essence of the EU law should be to establish the role of the employer in the process and of the Labour Protection Authorities, on the assumption that AI is only a working tool and not a subject of the law. Authorities should work together with employers to achieve the regulation objectives. Consideration should be given to introducing a responsive method of regulation in EU law, whereby the employer's application of employee health protection standards would be reviewed by the Authority to ensure that the objectives of the regulation are met. Depending on achieving a specific outcome or failing to meet the set targets, the Authority could intervene by applying appropriate punitive, incentive or reward mechanisms to the employer. Such a system of action, supported by providing adequate information to employers about the new risks associated with using AI, makes it possible to mobilise employers to take specific measures to protect employees' mental and physical health. © 2023 Maciej Jarota",-1,10.1016/j.clsr.2023.105825,"This paper analyzes the implications of AI in the workplace from an Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) perspective, focusing on proposed EU regulations.

"The widespread use of digital technologies has reshaped the resources and capabilities of firms, and changed the logic of value creation in their business models. Digitalization formed by relying on digital technologies, such as artificial intelligence, big data, and blockchain, has brought new opportunities and challenges to the business models of Chinese manufacturing firms. Based on the two types of strategic orientation (market orientation and entrepreneurial orientation), this paper investigates the relationship between market orientation (MO), entrepreneurial orientation (EO), and firm performance and the mediating effect of business model process formalization (PF). The study constructs the multiple paths of strategic orientation driving firm performance, and conducts an empirical test using a sample of 369 Chinese firms. The findings are as follows. (1) Both MO and EO can effectively improve firm performance, and the interaction term of the two orientations also has a positive effect on firm performance. (2) There are three different mediation paths for strategic orientation to improve firm performance: ‘MO→PF→firm performance’, ‘EO→PF→firm performance’, and ‘the interaction term of the two orientations→PF→firm performance’. (3) Among these three pathways, the indirect effect of ‘MO→PF→firm performance’ is the largest with an indirect effect of 12.29%, which is significantly larger than the effect of the other two pathways. These findings not only enrich the theories related to MO and EO, but also provide various options and management implications for Chinese firms to effectively carry out strategic orientation practices to implement business models in line with the digital economy. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",-1,10.1080/13602381.2023.2249428,"This paper examines how digitalization, including AI, affects the business models of Chinese manufacturing firms, focusing on market and entrepreneurial orientations.

"Purpose: This study aims to synthesize a research model based on artificial intelligence (AI) applications in the casino setting. The model incorporates the technology acceptance model (TAM) along with three external drivers, including factors pertinent to personal traits (i.e. openness), AI technology (i.e. visibility, security and social influence) and context (i.e. monetary motivation). Design/methodology/approach: An empirical study was conducted with 354 casino patrons. Partial least squares-structural equation modeling was used to test the proposed relationships. Findings: The results reveal that openness, security and monetary motivation are significant antecedents of perceived usefulness. Visibility and social influence have significant direct effects on the intention to gamble in AI-supported casinos.

"Purpose: This study explores insights from key stakeholders into the skills they believe will be necessary for the future of work as we become more reliant on artificial intelligence (AI) and technology. The study also seeks to understand what human resource policies and educational interventions are needed to support and take advantage of these changes. Design/methodology/approach: This is a qualitative study where a sample of highly experienced representatives from a range of small to large Irish organisations, both public and private, provide insights into this important topic. Findings: Findings indicate participants see a continued need for soft and hard skills as we evolve towards a more technologised workplace, with a need for employees to adopt a lifelong learning philosophy. As the knowledge economy in Ireland is well established, experts do not expect mass displacement to occur but differ with respect to the predicted rate of change. Novel HR interventions such as hiring for potential, pooling talent and establishing postgraduate supply contracts are seen as key. Current state interventions were mostly viewed positively but revamping of curricula is needed as well as stronger partnerships with tertiary institutions. Research limitations/implications: The interpretivist nature of the study limits the generalisability of the findings as they are based on a relatively small sample from one country. Also despite the significant expertise of the sample, it is not possible to predict whether their forecasts will manifest. Practical implications: This research highlights the need for Irish SMEs to embrace the impacts of automation and AI as many are seen to be slow in reacting to changes in technology.

"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to introduce innovative ideas into the treatment of the radical and incremental innovations and to fill the research gap by using: (1) methods that can perform complicated tasks and solve complex problems leading in creation of radical and incremental innovation and (2) a broad sample of firms across countries. The authors’ ambition is to contribute to the scientific knowledge by producing evidence about the novel usage of artificial neural network techniques for measuring European firms' innovation activities appearing in black boxes of innovation processes. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, the authors incorporate an international context into Chesbrough's open innovation (OI) theory and, on the one hand, support the hypothesis that European radical innovators benefit more from foreign cooperation than incremental innovators. On the other hand, the results of the analyses show that European incremental innovators rely on domestic cooperation supported by cooperation with foreign public research institutes. Moreover, the use of decision trees (DT) allows the authors to reveal specific patterns of successful innovators emerging within the hidden layers of neural networks.

"Purpose: The importance of artificial intelligence in human resource management has grown substantially. Previous literature discusses the advantages of AI implementation at a workplace and its various consequences, often hostile, for employees. However, there is little empirical research on the topic. The authors address this gap by studying if individuals oppose biased algorithm recommendations regarding disciplinary actions in an organisation. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted an exploratory experiment in which the authors evaluated 76 subjects over a set of 5 scenarios in which a biased algorithm gave strict recommendations regarding disciplinary actions at a workplace. Findings: The authors’ results suggest that biased suggestions from intelligent agents can influence individuals who make disciplinary decisions. Social implications: The authors’ results contribute to the ongoing debate on applying AI solutions to HR problems. The authors demonstrate that biased algorithms may substantially change how employees are treated and show that human conformity towards intelligent decision support systems is broader than expected.

"With the wide use of information technologies including Big Data and artificial intelligence (AI), consumers’ personal actions (their search history, transaction records, click-through behaviors, etc.) can be tracked, recorded and analyzed by the service provider (e.g., Google) to provide personalized services. Under the current regime, consumers usually hand over their personal data for free in exchange for high-quality services. As it becomes more and more commonly accepted that “data is property,” should consumers be entitled to claim their property rights over their personal data? New technologies emerge to empower consumers to control their own data, and the service provider may need to compensate for the usage of such data. How consumers and the service provider should react to such technologies, however, is not clear. We build a theoretical model in which consumers have different sensitivities towards their data ownership. We show that the impact of the data ownership shift depends not only on the service provider’s revenue structure and the discount in the service quality offered to non-data-providing consumers, but also on whether and how consumers are compensated. More importantly, if the service provider can endogenously adjust the qualities of services provided to consumers, the shift of data ownership may not necessarily benefit consumers, or harm the service provider. We also offer guidelines for data regulation policy designs. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",-1,10.1080/07421222.2023.2196775,"This paper develops a theoretical model to analyze the implications of data ownership on consumer behavior and service provider strategies in the context of AI and Big Data.

"Opportunity and resources are the two key elements of entrepreneurship, and they are inseparable. Scholars have paid more attention to integrating opportunities and resources for new ventures. At the same time, the academic community has widely recognized the important role of ‘dynamic capability’ in the survival and development of enterprises. However, few studies have explored the relationship between the integration of opportunity resources and dynamic capabilities of new ventures in essence and have not revealed the mechanism of big data analysis capability supported by artificial intelligence (BDAC-AI) in the process of improving the entrepreneurial performance of new ventures. Based on the resource-based view and dynamic capability theory, this paper integrates opportunity resource integration and dynamic capability into a research framework for the first time, constructs a new theoretical model and discusses the impact mechanism of BDAC-AI and opportunity resource integration on entrepreneurial performance. Based on the data of 225 new ventures, this paper finds that (1) both BDAC-AI and opportunity resource integration of new ventures have a positive impact on dynamic capability and dynamic capability has a positive role in promoting entrepreneurial performance; (2) dynamic capability plays an intermediary role in the relationship between BDAC-AI, opportunity resource integration and new venture performance; and (3) BDAC-AI positively regulates opportunity resource integration. However, it has no moderating effect on the mediating effect of dynamic capabilities.

"Background and Purpose: The growing role and involvement of Artificial Intelligence in modern digital enterprises leads to a considerable reduction of personnel and reorientation of the remaining staff to new responsibilities. However, in many areas like services and support the total elimination of the employed human resources still remains impossible.

"The article discusses the problem of assessing the investment attractiveness of risk projects for developing artificial intelligence, the methods of such assessment and their features. It is shown that due to the lack of relevant statistical, financial, operational information, the models and methods of investment valuation are, for the most part, subjective. The use of only one model or method of assessing investment attractiveness in the field of the development of artificial intelligence projects is insufficient, while the complex use without taking into account systemic aspects is likewise not sufficiently substantiated. To solve the existing problem, it is proposed to comprehensively use the available capabilities of the method of functional cost analysis (FSA), the essence of which is that the development project is decomposed into separate functions, and the necessary resources are measured and fixed for each function.

"The dynamics and speed of change in corporate environments have increased. At the front-end of innovation, firms are challenged to evaluate growing amounts of information within shorter time frames in order to stay competitive. Either they spend significant time on structured data analysis, at the risk of delayed market launch, or they follow their intuition, at the risk of not meeting market trends. Both scenarios constitute a significant risk for a firm's continued existence. Motivated by this, a conceptual model is presented in this paper that aims at remediating these risks. Grounded on design science methodology, it concentrates on previous assessments of innovation search fields. These innovation search fields assist in environmental scanning and lay the foundation for deciding which opportunities to pursue. The model applies a novel AI-based approach, which draws on natural language processing and information retrieval. To provide decision support, the approach includes market-, technology-, and firm-related criteria. This allows us to replace intuitive decision-making by fact-based considerations. In addition, an often-iterative approach for environmental scanning is replaced by a more straightforward process. Early testing of the conceptual model has shown results of increased quality and speed of decision-making. Further testing and feedback is still required to enhance and calibrate the AI-functionality.

"User-generated content on social media platforms and product search engines is changing the way consumers shop for goods online. However, current product search engines fail to effectively leverage information created across diverse social media platforms. Moreover, current ranking algorithms in these product search engines tend to induce consumers to focus on one single product characteristic dimension (e.g., price, star rating). This approach largely ignores consumers' multidimensional preferences for products. In this paper, we propose to generate a ranking system that recommends products that provide, on average, the best value for the consumer's money. The key idea is that products that provide a higher surplus should be ranked higher on the screen in response to consumer queries. We use a unique data set of U.S. hotel reservations made over a three-month period through Travelocity, which we supplement with data from various social media sources using techniques from text mining, image classification, social geotagging, human annotations, and geomapping. We propose a random coefficient hybrid structural model, taking into consideration the two sources of consumer heterogeneity the different travel occasions and different hotel characteristics introduce. Based on the estimates from the model, we infer the economic impact of various location and service characteristics of hotels. We then propose a new hotel ranking system based on the average utility gain a consumer receives from staying in a particular hotel. By doing so, we can provide customers with the ""best-value"" hotels early on. Our user studies, using ranking comparisons from several thousand users, validate the superiority of our ranking system relative to existing systems on several travel search engines.

"Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly reshaping service by performing various tasks, constituting a major source of innovation, yet threatening human jobs. We develop a theory of AI job replacement to address this double-edged impact. The theory specifies four intelligences required for service tasks—mechanical, analytical, intuitive, and empathetic—and lays out the way firms should decide between humans and machines for accomplishing those tasks. AI is developing in a predictable order, with mechanical mostly preceding analytical, analytical mostly preceding intuitive, and intuitive mostly preceding empathetic intelligence. The theory asserts that AI job replacement occurs fundamentally at the task level, rather than the job level, and for “lower” (easier for AI) intelligence tasks first. AI first replaces some of a service job’s tasks, a transition stage seen as augmentation, and then progresses to replace human labor entirely when it has the ability to take over all of a job’s tasks. The progression of AI task replacement from lower to higher intelligences results in predictable shifts over time in the relative importance of the intelligences for service employees. An important implication from our theory is that analytical skills will become less important, as AI takes over more analytical tasks, giving the “softer” intuitive and empathetic skills even more importance for service employees. Eventually, AI will be capable of performing even the intuitive and empathetic tasks, which enables innovative ways of human–machine integration for providing service but also results in a fundamental threat for human employment. © 2018, © The Author(s) 2018.",-1,10.1177/1094670517752459,"This paper develops a theory of AI job replacement, focusing on how AI impacts service tasks and the implications for human employment.

"The significance of big data analytics-powered artificial intelligence has grown in recent years. The literature indicates that big data analytics-powered artificial intelligence has the ability to enhance supply chain performance, but there is limited research concerning the reasons for which firms engaging in manufacturing activities adopt big data analytics-powered artificial intelligence. To address this gap, our study employs institutional theory and resource-based view theory to elucidate the way in which automotive firms configure tangible resources and workforce skills to drive technological enablement and improve sustainable manufacturing practices and furthermore develop circular economy capabilities. We tested the research hypothesis using primary data collected from 219 automotive and allied manufacturing companies operating in South Africa. The contribution of this work lies in the statistical validation of the theoretical framework, which provides insight regarding the role of institutional pressures on resources and their effects on the adoption of big data analytics-powered artificial intelligence, and how this affects sustainable manufacturing and circular economy capabilities under the moderating effects of organizational flexibility and industry dynamism. © 2020",-1,10.1016/j.techfore.2020.120420,"This paper examines the adoption of big data analytics-powered AI in automotive firms, using institutional and resource-based theories.

"This article develops a strategic framework for using artificial intelligence (AI) to engage customers for different service benefits. This framework lays out guidelines of how to use different AIs to engage customers based on considerations of nature of service task, service offering, service strategy, and service process. AI develops from mechanical, to thinking, and to feeling. As AI advances to a higher intelligence level, more human service employees and human intelligence (HI) at the intelligence levels lower than that level should be used less. Thus, at the current level of AI development, mechanical service should be performed mostly by mechanical AI, thinking service by both thinking AI and HI, and feeling service mostly by HI. Mechanical AI should be used for standardization when service is routine and transactional, for cost leadership, and mostly at the service delivery stage. Thinking AI should be used for personalization when service is data-rich and utilitarian, for quality leadership, and mostly at the service creation stage. Feeling AI should be used for relationalization when service is relational and high touch, for relationship leadership, and mostly at the service interaction stage.

"Firms traditionally rely on interviews and focus groups to identify customer needs for marketing strategy and product development. User-generated content (UGC) is a promising alternative source for identifying customer needs. However, established methods are neither efficient nor effective for large UGC corpora because much content is noninformative or repetitive. We propose a machine-learning approach to facilitate qualitative analysis by selecting content for efficient review. We use a convolutional neural network to filter out noninformative content and cluster dense sentence embeddings to avoid sampling repetitive content. We further address two key questions: Are UGC-based customer needs comparable to interview-based customer needs? Do the machine-learning methods improve customer-need identification? These comparisons are enabled by a custom data set of customer needs for oral care products identified by professional analysts using industry-standard experiential interviews. The analysts also coded 12,000 UGC sentences to identify which previously identified customer needs and/or new customer needs were articulated in each sentence. We show that (1) UGC is at least as valuable as a source of customer needs for product development, likely more valuable, compared with conventional methods, and (2) machine-learning methods improve efficiency of identifying customer needs from UGC (unique customer needs per unit of professional services cost). © 2019 INFORMS.",-1,10.1287/mksc.2018.1123,"This paper proposes a machine-learning approach to analyze user-generated content (UGC) for identifying customer needs, comparing it to traditional methods like interviews.

"At the heart of any innovation process lies a fundamental practice: the way people create ideas and solve problems. This “decision making” side of innovation is what scholars and practitioners refer to as “design.” Decisions in innovation processes have so far been taken by humans. What happens when they can be substituted by machines? Artificial Intelligence (AI) brings data and algorithms to the core of the innovation processes. What are the implications of this diffusion of AI for our understanding of design and innovation? Is AI just another digital technology that, akin to many others, will not significantly question what we know about design? Or will it create transformations in design that current theoretical frameworks cannot capture?. This paper proposes a framework for understanding the design and innovation in the age of AI. We discuss the implications for design and innovation theory. Specifically, we observe that, as creative problem-solving is significantly conducted by algorithms, human design increasingly becomes an activity of sensemaking, that is, understanding which problems should or could be addressed. This shift in focus calls for the new theories and brings design closer to leadership, which is, inherently, an activity of sensemaking. Our insights are derived from and illustrated with two cases at the frontier of AI—Netflix and Airbnb (complemented with analyses of Microsoft and Tesla)—which point to two directions for the evolution of design and innovation in firms. First, AI enables an organization to overcome many past limitations of human-intensive design processes, by improving the scalability of the process, broadening its scope across traditional boundaries, and enhancing its ability to learn and adapt on the fly. Second, and maybe more surprising, while removing these limitations, AI also appears to deeply enact several popular design principles. AI thus reinforces the principles of Design Thinking, namely: being people-centered, abductive, and iterative. In fact, AI enables the creation of solutions that are more highly user centered than human-based approaches (i.e., to an extreme level of granularity, designed for every single person); that are potentially more creative; and that are continuously updated through learning iterations across the entire product life cycle. In sum, while AI does not undermine the basic principles of design, it profoundly changes the practice of design. Problem-solving tasks, traditionally carried out by designers, are now automated into learning loops that operate without limitations of volume and speed. The algorithms embedded in these loops think in a radically different way than a designer who handles the complex problems holistically with a systemic perspective. Algorithms instead handle complexity through very simple tasks, which are iterated continuously. This paper discusses the implications of these insights for design and innovation management scholars and practitioners. © 2020 Product Development & Management Association",-1,10.1111/jpim.12523,"This paper examines the implications of AI on design and innovation processes, proposing a framework that highlights the shift from human decision-making to algorithm-driven problem-solving.

"How do configurations of humans and algorithms evolve as firms adopt artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities, and what are the implications for work and organization? We explored these questions through a two-year long case study of an organization in the international maritime trade that introduced automated algorithmic support for data analysis and prediction work. Drawing on a human–machine configuration perspective, we found that humans and the algorithm were configured and reconfigured in multiple ways over time as the organization dealt with the introduction of algorithmic analysis. In contrast to replacing human work, the emergent configurations required new roles and redistribution of extant expertise to augment and improve the accuracy of the algorithm. Our analysis suggests that the new configuration resembled a human-in-the-loop pattern, comprised of both the augmentation work of auditing (i.e. the generation of a ground truth and assessment of the algorithmic output against this) as well as the work of altering the algorithm and the data acquisition architecture.

"Organizational decision-makers need to evaluate AI tools in light of increasing claims that such tools outperform human experts. Yet, measuring the quality of knowledge work is challenging, raising the question of how to evaluate AI performance in such contexts. We investigate this question through a field study of a major U.S. hospital, observing how managers evaluated five different machine-learning (ML) based AI tools. Each tool reported high performance according to standard AI accuracy measures, which were based on ground truth labels provided by qualified experts. Trying these tools out in practice, however, revealed that none of them met expectations. Searching for explanations, managers began confronting the high uncertainty of experts’ know-what knowledge captured in ground truth labels used to train and validate ML models. In practice, experts address this uncertainty by drawing on rich know-how practices, which were not incorporated into these ML-based tools. Discovering the disconnect between AI’s know-what and experts’ know-how enabled managers to better understand the risks and benefits of each tool.

"Purpose: This study attempts to develop a practical understanding of the positive and negative employee experiences due to artificial intelligence (AI) adoption and the creation of technostress. It unravels the human resource development-related challenges with the onset of Industry 4.0. Design/methodology/approach: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 32 professionals with average work experience of 7.6 years and working across nine industries, and the transcripts were analyzed using NVivo. Findings: The findings establish prominent adverse impacts of the adoption of AI, namely, information security, data privacy, drastic changes resulting from digital transformations and job risk and insecurity brewing in the employee psyche. This is followed by a hierarchy of factors comprising the positive impacts, namely, work-related flexibility and autonomy, creativity and innovation and overall enhancement in job performance. Further factors contributing to technostress (among employees): work overload, job insecurity and complexity were identified. Practical implications: The emerging knowledge economy and technological interventions are changing the existing job profiles, hence the need for different skillsets and technological competencies. The organizations thus need to deploy strategic manpower development measures involving up-gradation of skills and knowledge management. Inculcating requisite skills requires well-designed training programs using specialized tools and virtual reality (VR).

"We study how humans make decisions when they collaborate with an artificial intelligence (AI) in a setting where humans and the AI perform classification tasks. Our experimental results suggest that humans and AI who work together can outperform the AI that outperforms humans when it works on its own. However, the combined performance improves only when the AI delegates work to humans but not when humans delegate work to the AI. The AI’s delegation performance improved even when it delegated to low-performing subjects; by contrast, humans did not delegate well and did not benefit from delegation to the AI. This bad delegation performance cannot be explained with some kind of algorithm aversion. On the contrary, subjects acted rationally in an internally consistent manner by trying to follow a proven delegation strategy and appeared to appreciate the AI support. However, human performance suffered as a result of a lack of metaknowledge—that is, humans were not able to assess their own capabilities correctly, which in turn led to poor delegation decisions. Lacking metaknowledge, in contrast to reluctance to use AI, is an unconscious trait. It fundamentally limits how well human decision makers can collaborate with AI and other algorithms. The results have implications for the future of work, the design of human–AI collaborative environments, and education in the digital age. © 2021 The Author(s)",-1,10.1287/isre.2021.1079,"This paper examines human decision-making in collaboration with AI during classification tasks.

"We analyze how advice from an AI affects complementarities between humans and AI, in particular what humans know that an AI does not know: “unique human knowledge.” In a multi-method study consisting of an analytical model, experimental studies, and a simulation study, our main finding is that human choices converge toward similar responses improving individual accuracy. However, as overall individual accuracy of the group of humans improves, the individual unique human knowledge decreases. Based on this finding, we claim that humans interacting with AI behave like “Borgs,” that is, cyborg creatures with strong individual performance but no human individuality. We argue that the loss of unique human knowledge may lead to several undesirable outcomes in a host of human–AI decision environments. We demonstrate this harmful impact on the “wisdom of crowds.” Simulation results based on our experimental data suggest that groups of humans interacting with AI are far less effective as compared to human groups without AI assistance. We suggest mitigation techniques to create environments that can provide the best of both worlds (e.g., by personalizing AI advice). We show that such interventions perform well individually as well as in wisdom of crowds settings. ©2021. The Authors.

"As revealed by Tapscott in his best-seller The Digital Economy published in 1994, the Internet has dramatically changed the way of conducting business and our daily lives. Further advancement of digital innovation, including cloud, mobile services, and artificial intelligence, has augmented this change significantly and provided us with extraordinary services and welfare never anticipated before. However, contrary to such an accomplishment, productivity in industrialized countries now confronts an apparent decline raising the question of a possible productivity paradox in the digital economy. The limitations of gross domestic product (GDP) statistics in measuring the advancement of the digital economy have become an important subject. While this mismatch is an old problem rooted in the dynamics of product innovations, since mismatch brought about by information and communication technology (ICT) is very strong, finding a solution to this critical issue has become highly crucial in the digital economy. Based on an intensive review of preceding studies and empirical analyses of national, industrial and individual behaviors in the digital economy, this paper attempted to draw a perspective on this critical issue. By means of an analysis of co-evolution among a shift in people's preferences from economic functionality to supra-functionality beyond economic value, the advancement of ICT and paradigm change to uncaptured GDP, a solution to this critical issue was investigated. New insights for measuring the digital economy were explored which provide insight into integration of national accounts with product-oriented micro-analysis efforts. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",-1,10.1016/j.techfore.2018.07.053,"This paper reviews the productivity paradox in the digital economy, focusing on the limitations of GDP in measuring digital advancements.

"As part of the urgent need to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, governments, healthcare providers, and businesses have looked to applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to compensate for the unavailability of human workers. This interest has renewed the debate regarding the use of AI for the automation of work, which has been described as Intelligent Automation (IA). A new dimension to this debate is whether COVID-19 will be the catalyst for higher IA adoption levels. This article reviews arguments in favour of COVID-19 increasing the level of IA adoption and possible counter-arguments. Key arguments in favour of increased IA adoption include consumer preferences changing to favour IA, increasing familiarity of IA technologies, and increased business confidence in IA. Counter-arguments include big data availability and reliability limitations, many tasks still favouring human skills over IA, the narrow capabilities of IA technologies, and a high availability of human workers.

"Organizations have cultural-cognitive and regulative as well as normative elements that impact their employees. Organizations, by definition, cannot achieve a pure, stable state and always go through various change processes, both incremental and radical changes. Moving from legacy business-to-business (B2B) relationship management to an artificial intelligence-based customer relationship management (AI-CRM) is a gradual but paradigm change. AI-CRM leverages intelligent systems to automate the B2B relationship activities where the decision can be taken automatically without any human intervention.

"Firms are exploiting artificial intelligence (AI) coaches to provide training to sales agents and improve their job skills. The authors present several caveats associated with such practices based on a series of randomized field experiments. Experiment 1 shows that the incremental benefit of the AI coach over human managers is heterogeneous across agents in an inverted-U shape: whereas middle-ranked agents improve their performance by the largest amount, both bottom- and top-ranked agents show limited incremental gains. This pattern is driven by a learning-based mechanism in which bottom-ranked agents encounter the most severe information overload problem with the AI versus human coach, while top-ranked agents hold the strongest aversion to the AI relative to a human coach. To alleviate the challenge faced by bottom-ranked agents, Experiment 2 redesigns the AI coach by restricting the training feedback level and shows a significant improvement in agent performance. Experiment 3 reveals that the AI–human coach assemblage outperforms either the AI or human coach alone. This assemblage can harness the hard data skills of the AI coach and soft interpersonal skills of human managers, solving both problems faced by bottom- and top-ranked agents.

"Companies are increasingly using artificial intelligence (AI) to provide performance feedback to employees, by tracking employee behavior at work, automating performance evaluations, and recommending job improvements. However, this application of AI has provoked much debate. On the one hand, powerful AI data analytics increase the quality of feedback, which may enhance employee productivity (“deployment effect”). On the other hand, employees may develop a negative perception of AI feedback once it is disclosed to them, thus harming their productivity (“disclosure effect”). We examine these two effects theoretically and test them empirically using data from a field experiment. We find strong evidence that both effects coexist, and that the adverse disclosure effect is mitigated by employees' tenure in the firm. These findings offer pivotal implications for management theory, practice, and public policies. Managerial abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are bound to transform how companies manage employees. We examine the use of AI to generate performance feedback for employees. We demonstrate that AI significantly increases the accuracy and consistency of the analyses of information collected, and the relevance of feedback to each employee. These advantages of AI help employees achieve greater job performance at scale, and thus create value for companies. However, our study also alerts companies to the negative effect of disclosing using AI to employee that results from employees' negative perceptions about the deployment of AI, which offsets the business value created by AI. To alleviate value-destroying disclosure effect, we suggest that companies be more proactive in communicating with their employees about the objectives, benefits, and scope of AI applications in order to assuage their concerns. Moreover, the result of the allayed negative AI disclosure effect among employees with a longer tenure in the company suggests that companies may consider deploying AI in a tiered instead of a uniform fashion, that is, using AI to provide performance feedback to veteran employees but using human managers to provide performance feedback to novices. © 2021 The Authors.

"While the growth of the mobile apps market has created significant market opportunities and economic incentives for mobile app developers to innovate, it has also inevitably invited other developers to create rip-offs. Practitioners and developers of original apps claim that copycats steal the original app's idea and potential demand, and have called for app platforms to take action against such copycats. Surprisingly, however, there has been little rigorous research analyzing whether and how copycats affect an original app's demand. The primary deterrent to such research is the lack of an objective way to identify whether an app is a copycat or an original. Using a combination of machine learning techniques such as natural language processing, latent semantic analysis, network-based clustering, and image analysis, we propose a method to identify apps as original or copycat and detect two types of copycats: deceptive and nondeceptive. Based on the detection results, we conduct an econometric analysis to determine the impact of copycat apps on the demand for the original apps on a sample of 10,100 action game apps by 5,141 developers that were released in the iOS App Store over five years. Our results indicate that the effect of a specific copycat on an original app's demand is determined by the quality and level of deceptiveness of the copycat. High-quality nondeceptive copycats negatively affect demand for the originals. By contrast, low-quality, deceptive copycats positively affect demand for the originals. Results indicate that in aggregate the impact of copycats on the demand of original mobile apps is statistically insignificant.

"Digitalization has altered many assumptions underpinning research on innovation management. At the early innings of exploring how digital innovation management stands out, there is a need for further studies in this area. Previous research on how firms use artificial intelligence has distinguished between automation and augmentation of human activities. In this paper, we explore how firms implement artificial intelligence within research and development. Utilizing an international news database spanning 956 articles from 122 newspapers published in 2020, we find that artificial intelligence is primarily adopted to augment human activities (55%) within research and development, rather than to automate matters (11%). We observe differences across sectors where automation is more common in government, information and communication technology (ICT), and technology and software. Our systematic coding shows that artificial intelligence is primarily adopted for exploration research and development (64%), rather than exploitation (5%). Based on these findings, we conclude that research and development from artificial intelligence primarily focuses on novel markets and areas of operations, rather than enhancing existing product markets and activities.

"Research Summary: The use of machine learning (ML) for productivity in the knowledge economy requires considerations of important biases that may arise from ML predictions. We define a new source of bias related to incompleteness in real time inputs, which may result from strategic behavior by agents. We theorize that domain expertise of users can complement ML by mitigating this bias. Our observational and experimental analyses in the patent examination context support this conjecture. In the face of “input incompleteness,” we find ML is biased toward finding prior art textually similar to focal claims and domain expertise is needed to find the most relevant prior art. We also document the importance of vintage-specific skills, and discuss the implications for artificial intelligence and strategic management of human capital. Managerial Summary: Unleashing the productivity benefits of machine learning (ML) technologies in the future of work requires managers to pay careful attention to mitigating potential biases from its use. One such bias occurs when there is input incompleteness to the ML tool, potentially because agents strategically provide information that may benefit them. We demonstrate that in such circumstances, ML tools can make worse predictions than the prior technology vintages. To ensure productivity benefits of ML in light of potentially strategic inputs, our research suggests that managers need to consider two attributes of human capital—domain expertise and vintage-specific skills. Domain expertise complements ML by correcting for the (strategic) incompleteness of the input to the ML tool, while vintage-specific skills ensure the ability to properly operate the technology. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",-1,10.1002/smj.3152,"This paper examines biases in machine learning predictions related to input incompleteness, particularly in the patent examination context.

"Managerial estimates are ubiquitous in accounting: most balance sheet and income statement items are based on estimates; some, such as the pension and employee stock options expenses, derive from multiple estimates. These estimates are affected by objective estimation errors as well as by managerial manipulation, thereby harming the reliability and relevance of financial reports. We show that machine learning can substantially improve managerial estimates. Specifically, using insurance companies’ data on loss reserves (future customer claims) estimates and realizations, we document that the loss estimates generated by machine learning were superior to actual managerial estimates reported in financial statements in four out of five insurance lines examined. Our evidence suggests that machine learning techniques can be highly useful to managers and auditors in improving accounting estimates, thereby enhancing the usefulness of financial information to investors. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",-1,10.1007/s11142-020-09546-9,"This paper demonstrates how machine learning can enhance the accuracy of managerial estimates in accounting, specifically focusing on loss reserves in insurance companies.

"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to explore the behavioral intention of the employees to adopt artificial intelligence (AI) integrated customer relationship management (CRM) system in Indian organizations. Design/methodology/approach: To identify the factors impacting the behavioral intention of the employees to adopt AI integrated CRM system in Indian organizations helps of literature review and theories have been taken. Thereafter, some hypotheses have been formulated followed by the development of a theoretical model conceptually. The model has been tested statistically for validation using a survey by considering 308 usable respondents. Findings: The results of this study show that perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use directly impact the behavioral intention of the employees to adopt an AI integrated CRM system in organizations. Also, these two exogenous factors impact the behavioral intention of the employees to adopt an AI integrated CRM system mediating through two intermediate variables such as utilitarian attitude (UTA) and hedonic attitude (HEA). The proposed model has achieved predictive power of 67%. Research limitations/implications: By the help of the technology acceptance model and motivational theory, the predictors of behavioral intention to adopt AI integrated CRM systems in organizations were identified. The effectiveness of the model was strengthened by the consideration of two employee-centric attitudinal attributes such as UTA and HEA, which is claimed to have provided contributions to the extant literature. The proposed theoretical model claims a special theoretical contribution as no extant literature considered the effects of leadership support as a moderator for the adoption of an AI integrated CRM system in Indian organizations. Practical implications: The model implies that the employees using AI integrated CRM system in organizations must be made aware of the usefulness of the system and the employees must not face any complexity to use the system. For this, the managers of the concerned organizations must create a conducive atmosphere congenial for the employees to use the AI integrated CRM system in the organizations.

"The continuous digitization requires organizations to improve the automation of their business processes. Among others, this has lead to an increased interest in Robotic Process Automation (RPA). RPA solutions emerge in the form of software that automatically executes repetitive and routine tasks. While the benefits of RPA on cost savings and other relevant performance indicators have been demonstrated in different contexts, one of the key challenges for RPA endeavors is to effectively identify processes and tasks that are suitable for automation. Textual process descriptions, such as work instructions, provide rich and important insights about this matter. However, organizations often maintain hundreds or even thousands of them, which makes a manual analysis unfeasible for larger organizations. Recognizing the large manual effort required to determine the current degree of automation in an organization’s business processes, we use this paper to propose an approach that is able to automatically do so. More specifically, we leverage supervised machine learning to automatically identify whether a task described in a textual process description is manual, an interaction of a human with an information system or automated. An evaluation with a set of 424 activities from a total of 47 textual process descriptions demonstrates that our approach produces satisfactory results. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.",-1,10.1007/978-3-319-91704-7_5,"This paper proposes a machine learning approach to automatically identify the degree of automation in business processes based on textual descriptions.

"The richness of organizational learning relies on the ability of humans to develop diverse patterns of action by actively engaging with their environments and applying substantive rationality. The substitution of human decision-making with machine learning has the potential to alter this richness of organizational learning. Though machine learning is significantly faster and seemingly unconstrained by human cognitive limitations and inflexibility, it is not true sentient learning and relies on formal statistical analysis for decision-making. We propose that the distinct differences between human learning and machine learning risk decreasing the within-organizational diversity in organizational routines and the extent of causal, contextual, and general knowledge associated with routines. We theorize that these changes may affect organizational learning by exacerbating the myopia of learning, and highlight some important contingencies that may mute or amplify the risk of such myopia.

"Despite significant theoretical and empirical attention on public value creation in the public sector, the relationship between artificial intelligence (AI) use and value creation from the citizen perspective remains poorly understood. We ground our study in Moore's public value management to examine the relationship between AI use and value creation. We conceptually categorize public service value into public value and private value. We use procedural justice and trust in government as indicators of public value and, based on motivation theory, we use perceived usefulness and perceived enjoyment as indicators of private value. A field survey of 492 AI voice robot users in China was conducted to test our model. The results indicated that the effective use of AI voice robots was significantly associated with private value and procedural justice. However, the relationship between the effective use of AI and trust in government was not found to be significant. Surprisingly, the respondents indicated that private value had a greater effect on overall value creation than public value. This contrasts with the common idea that value creation from the government perspective suggests that social objectives requiring public value are more important to citizens.

"Algorithms, increasingly used by brands, sometimes fail to perform as expected or, even worse, cause harm, leading to brand harm crises. Algorithm failures are unfortunately increasing in frequency, yet little is known about consumers’ responses to brands following such crises. Extending developments in the theory of mind perception, the authors hypothesize that, following a brand harm crisis, consumers respond less negatively if the error was caused by an algorithm (vs. a human). The authors further hypothesize that consumers’ lower mind perception of agency of the algorithm (vs. a human), which lowers their perceptions of the algorithm’s responsibility for the harm, mediates this relationship. Four moderators of this relationship are hypothesized: two algorithm characteristics (whether the algorithm is anthropomorphized and whether it involves machine learning) and two characteristics of the task for which the algorithm is deployed (whether the task is subjective [vs. objective] and whether it is interactive [vs. noninteractive]). The authors find support for the hypotheses in eight experimental studies. The effects of two managerial interventions to manage brand harm crises caused by algorithm errors are examined.

"This article examines how governments can regulate the values of social media companies that themselves regulate disinformation spread on their own platforms. We use ‘disinformation’ to refer to motivated faking of news. We examine the effects that disinformation initiatives (many based on automated decision-making systems using Artificial Intelligence [AI] to cope with the scale of content being shared) have on freedom of expression, media pluralism and the exercise of democracy, from the wider lens of tackling illegal content online and concerns to request proactive (automated) measures of online intermediaries. We particularly focus on the responses of the member states and institutions of the European Union. In Section 1, we argue that the apparent significance of the threat has led many governments to legislate despite this lack of evidence, with over 40 national laws to combat disinformation chronicled by March 2019. Which types of regulation are proposed, which actors are targeted, and who is making these regulations? Regulating fake news should not fall solely on national governments or supranational bodies like the European Union. Neither should the companies be responsible for regulating themselves. Instead, we favour co-regulation. Co-regulation means that the companies develop – individually or collectively – mechanisms to regulate their own users, which in turn must be approved by democratically legitimate state regulators or legislatures, who also monitor their effectiveness. In Section 2, we explain the current EU use of Codes of Conduct. In Section 3, we then explain the relatively novel idea that social media content regulation, and specifically disinformation, can be dealt with by deploying AI at massive scale. It is necessary to deal with this technological issue in order to explain the wider content of co-regulatory policy options, which we explain and for which we argue in Section 4.

"This paper investigates the dependence structure and dynamics between artificial intelligence (AI) and carbon prices in the era of the 4th industrial revolution. Using the NASDAQ AI price index as a measure of AI and the European Energy Exchange EU emissions trading system (i.e. certificate prices for CO2 emissions) as a measure of carbon prices, we employ time-varying Markov switching copula models from December 2017 to July 2020 that provide evidence of a time-varying Markov tail dependence structure and dynamics between AI and carbon prices. The result shows a negative dependence structure for the return series between AI and carbon prices. However, the relationship is asymmetric, indicating that there is a stronger tail dependence in the lower tails instead of the upper tails. The finding implies that AI is a favourable hedge against carbon prices, therefore indicating the diversification benefits of AI.

"The present research demonstrates how consumer responses to negative and positive offers are influenced by whether the administering marketing agent is an artificial intelligence (AI) or a human. In the case of a product or service offer that is worse than expected, consumers respond better when dealing with an AI agent in the form of increased purchase likelihood and satisfaction. In contrast, for an offer that is better than expected, consumers respond more positively to a human agent. The authors demonstrate that AI agents, compared with human agents, are perceived to have weaker intentions when administering offers, which accounts for this effect. That is, consumers infer that AI agents lack selfish intentions in the case of an offer that favors the agent and lack benevolent intentions in the case of an offer that favors the customer, thereby dampening the extremity of consumer responses. Moreover, the authors demonstrate a moderating effect, such that marketers may anthropomorphize AI agents to strengthen perceived intentions, providing an avenue to receive due credit from consumers when the agent provides a better offer and mitigate blame when it provides a worse offer.

These hypotheses were validated with the help of statistical tools by conducting sample survey with 324 usable responses against 36 questionnaires. Findings: The results of this study highlight that of the eight hypotheses conceptually formulated, one hypothesis was not supported as is evident from the application of statistical analysis. This is the influence of perceived ease of use on attitude of the stakeholders intending to use the AI-integrated CRM system in Indian organizations. The results also transpire that the model so provided has achieved 87% explanative power. Research limitations/implications: The model so provided has taken the help of the technological acceptance model. It has also used the issues circumscribing menace of security and privacy vulnerabilities. Consideration of the technological acceptance model and aspects of issues of security and privacy has enriched the model rendering its explanative power to 87%. Practical implications: The model is simple. Practitioners can execute this model without having any complexity. The policymakers could also get inputs from the model, as it has focused specially on security and privacy issues that could help to enhance the trust of the potential users.

"This paper analyses the link between the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and innovation performance in firms. Based on firm-level data from the German part of the Community Innovation Survey (CIS) 2018, we examine the role of different AI methods and application areas in innovation. The results show that 5.8% of firms in Germany were actively using AI in their business operations or products and services in 2019. We find that the use of AI is associated with annual sales with world-first product innovations in these firms of about €16 billion (i.e. 18% of total annual sales of world-first innovations). In addition, AI technologies have been used in process innovation that contributed to about 6% of total annual cost savings of the German business sector. Firms that apply AI broadly (using different methods for different applications areas) and that have already several years of experience in using AI obtain significantly higher innovation results. These positive findings on the role of AI for innovation have to be interpreted with caution as they refer to a specific country (Germany) in a situation where AI started to diffuse rapidly. © 2022",-1,10.1016/j.respol.2022.104555,"This paper analyzes the relationship between AI usage and innovation performance in German firms, utilizing data from the Community Innovation Survey.

"What will happen to law firms and the legal profession when the use of artificial intelligence (AI) becomes prevalent in legal services? We address this question by considering three related levels of analysis: Tasks, business models, and organizations. First, we review AI's technical capabilities in relation to tasks, to identify contexts where it is likely to replace or augment humans. AI is capable of doing some, but not all, legal tasks better than lawyers and is augmented by multidisciplinary human inputs. Second, we identify new business models for creating value in legal services by applying AI. These differ from law firms' traditional legal advisory business model, because they require technological (non-human) assets and multidisciplinary human inputs. Third, we analyze the organizational structure that complements the old and new business models: The professional partnership (P2) is well-Adapted to delivering the legal advisory business model, but the centralized management, access to outside capital, and employee incentives offered by the corporate form appear better to complement the new AI-enabled business models. Some law firms are experimenting with pursuing new and old business models in parallel. However, differences in complements create conflicts when business models are combined. These conflicts are partially externalized via contracting and segregated and realigned via vertical integration. Our analysis suggests that law firm experimentation with aligning different business models to distinct organizational entities, along with ethical concerns, will affect the extent to which the legal profession will become 'hybrid professionals'. © 2020 The Author(s).

"Firms apply strategic foresight in technology and innovation management to detect discontinuous changes early, to assess their expected consequences, and to develop a future course of action enabling superior company performance. For this purpose, an ever-increasing amount of data has to be collected, analyzed, and interpreted. Still, a major part of these activities is performed manually, which requires high investments in various resources. To support these processes more efficiently, this article presents an artificial-intelligence-based data mining model that helps firms spot emerging topics and trends at a higher level of automation than before. Its modular structure consists of components for query generation, data collection, data preprocessing, topic modeling, topic analysis, and visualization, combined in such a way that only a minimum amount of manual effort is required during its initial set up. The approach also incorporates self-adaptive capabilities, allowing the model to automatically update itself once new data has become available. The model parameterization is based on latest research in this area, and its threshold parameter is learnt during supervised training using a training data set. We have applied our model to an independent test data set to verify its effectiveness as an early warning system. By means of a retrospective analysis, we show in three case studies that our model is able to identify emerging technologies prior to their first publication in the Gartner Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies.

"We study how Airbnb property demand changed after the acquisition of verified images (taken by Airbnb’s photographers) and explore what makes a good image for an Airbnb property. Using deep learning and difference-in-difference analyses on an Airbnb panel data set spanning 7,423 properties over 16 months, we find that properties with verified images had 8.98% higher occupancy than properties without verified images (images taken by the host). To explore what constitutes a good image for an Airbnb property, we quantify 12 human-interpretable image attributes that pertain to three artistic aspects—composition, color, and the figure-ground relationship—and we find systematic differences between the verified and unverified images. We also predict the relationship between each of the 12 attributes and property demand, and we find that most of the correlations are significant and in the theorized direction.

"Management scholars and practitioners have highlighted the importance of ethical dimensions in the selection of strategies. However, to date, there has been little effort aimed at theoretically understanding the ethical positions of individuals/organizations concerning human resource management (HRM) decision-making processes, the selection of specific ethical positions and strategies, or the post-decision accounting for those decisions. To this end, we present a Throughput model framework that describes individuals' decision-making processes in an algorithmic HRM context. The model depicts how perceptions, judgments, and the use of information affect strategy selection, identifying how diverse strategies may be supported by the employment of certain ethical decision-making algorithmic pathways. In focusing on concerns relating to the impact and acceptance of artificial intelligence (AI) integration in HRM, this research draws insights from multidisciplinary theoretical lenses, such as AI-augmented (HRM(AI)) and HRM(AI) assimilation processes, AI-mediated social exchange, and the judgment and choice literature.

"SYNOPSIS: This paper aims to promote the application of deep learning to audit procedures by illustrating how the capabilities of deep learning for text understanding, speech recognition, visual recognition, and structured data analysis fit into the audit environment. Based on these four capabilities, deep learning serves two major functions in supporting audit decision making: information identification and judgment support. The paper proposes a framework for applying these two deep learning functions to a variety of audit procedures in different audit phases. An audit data warehouse of historical data can be used to construct prediction models, providing suggested actions for various audit procedures. The data warehouse will be updated and enriched with new data instances through the application of deep learning and a human auditor’s corrections.

"In the hospitality industry, demand forecast accuracy is highly impacted by booking cancellations, which makes demand-management decisions difficult and risky. In attempting to minimize losses, hotels tend to implement restrictive cancellation policies and employ overbooking tactics, which, in turn, reduce the number of bookings and reduce revenue. To tackle the uncertainty arising from booking cancellations, we combined the data from eight hotels’ property management systems with data from several sources (weather, holidays, events, social reputation, and online prices/inventory) and machine learning interpretable algorithms to develop booking cancellation prediction models for the hotels. In a real production environment, improvement of the forecast accuracy due to the use of these models could enable hoteliers to decrease the number of cancellations, thus, increasing confidence in demand-management decisions. Moreover, this work shows that improvement of the demand forecast would allow hoteliers to better understand their net demand, that is, current demand minus predicted cancellations. Simultaneously, by focusing not only on forecast accuracy but also on its explicability, this work illustrates one other advantage of the application of these types of techniques in forecasting: the interpretation of the predictions of the model. By exposing cancellation drivers, models help hoteliers to better understand booking cancellation patterns and enable the adjustment of a hotel’s cancellation policies and overbooking tactics according to the characteristics of its bookings. © The Author(s) 2019.",-1,10.1177/1938965519851466,"This paper develops machine learning models to predict booking cancellations in the hospitality industry, aiming to improve demand forecast accuracy.

"Considering that government funding agencies make decisions on research and development (R&D) budget allocation to support an increasing number of research proposals, effective decision support systems are necessarily required. Motivated by the efforts of the Korean government, we propose a new decision support framework for allocating an R&D budget such that it maximizes the total expected R&D output. The proposed framework incorporates an R&D output prediction model with an optimization technique. We first employ a machine learning algorithm to accurately estimate future R&D output. Then, we apply a robust optimization technique to hedge against uncertainty in the predicted R&D output values. If not properly accounted for, this uncertainty may yield an inefficient budget allocation plan, thus hindering the operation of the R&D budgeting system. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model by applying it to a national R&D program conducted by the Korean government. Specifically, using the same budget, our budget allocation plan can achieve an output 13.6% greater than the actual R&D output. Thus, our model helps to attain allocation efficiency by systematically allocating budgets. We also observe the price of robustness when our model conservatively allocates budgets in order to hedge against uncertainty in the R&D predictions.

"Purpose: This paper aims to determine the entrepreneur's intention to accept artificial intelligence (AI) and provide advancement in the domain of digital entrepreneurship. Design/methodology/approach: Extensive literature review and theories have been considered in the area of technology adoption/acceptance and digital entrepreneurship to identify the factors affecting the intention of entrepreneurs with respect to accept AI for digital entrepreneurship. Further, a model, artificial intelligence acceptance and digital entrepreneurship (AIADE) is theorized after formulating some hypotheses. The theorized model has been validated with 476 useable responses. Findings: The findings revealed that performance expectancy, openness, social influence, hedonic motivations and generativity have a positive impact on entrepreneur's acceptance intention of AI. Additionally, affordance has no direct relationship with AI acceptance intention, but it affects AI acceptance intention through attitude. Inconvenience has a significant negative relationship with the intention to accept AI, while uncertainty was found to be positively affecting the AI acceptance intention. Effort expectancy did not confirm any significant relationship. Research limitations/implications: By considering existing theoretical models and concepts the authors contribute to the AI's theoretical progress, specifically in the domain of entrepreneurship. The authors complement and extend existing technology adoption/acceptance theories and digital entrepreneurship theories by developing a theoretical model, AIADE, explaining the entrepreneur's intention to accept AI.

"Through recent leaps in application, artificial intelligence (AI) has become one of the most promising digital technologies, attracting significant attention from scholars and practitioners alike. Prior innovation research has mainly focused on the opportunities for and challenges to infusing digital technologies into the innovation process. However, understanding the general effects of digital technologies is insufficient as their specific fields of application differ. AI is distinct from other digital technologies, given its potential to evolve into both a general-purpose technology and a method of inventing, and several firms are beginning to integrate AI into their innovation processes. We capture this phenomenon by introducing a concept we term self-innovating artificial intelligence (SAI), defined as the organizational utilization of AI with the aim of incrementally advancing existing or developing new products, based on insights from continuously combining and analyzing multiple data sources. As SAI is about to fundamentally change how innovations are created, this article describes the underlying AI technology; conceptualizes and outlines how firms may incorporate SAI into their innovation processes with the aim of developing increasingly complex products; and offers potential avenues for further research in this intriguing domain.  © 1988-2012 IEEE.",-1,10.1109/TEM.2020.2977222,"This paper introduces the concept of self-innovating artificial intelligence (SAI) and explores its role in enhancing innovation processes within firms.

"Recent proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) in service encounters gives rise to questions on how consumers respond to these novel technologies. This study seeks to examine the influence of AI service failures on consumers’ propensity to share negative word-of-mouth. Three experiments demonstrate that consumers are less willing to share negative word-of-mouth after a service failure caused by an AI recommendation system, in contrast to a human employee, despite there being no difference in the failure, firm blame, or dissatisfaction with the failure. Further investigation suggests that this effect is driven by consumers’ perceived connection with the AI that uses their past behavior to predict their future preferences. The conclusions shed light on the overall understanding of consumer-AI interactions. The results also provide managerial implications for firms to implement AI effectively and carefully in their service offerings. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",-1,10.1080/02642069.2020.1748014,"This study examines consumer responses to AI service failures and their impact on negative word-of-mouth sharing.

"Different from the strong evidence in the literature that voluntary disclosure in general and corporate social responsibility (CSR) disclosure in particular is associated with corporate financial performance results for the association of CSR disclosure and firmlevel cost of capital are not fully convincing. We argue that contradictory findings result from research design limitations and revisit the relationship, hence. Predicting a negative relationship between CSR disclosure and information asymmetry as well as for CSR disclosure and cost of capital, we examine our hypotheses based on a sample of 264 German companies that provide English language CSR reporting along with current stock prices and analyst forecast data. We use artificial intelligence based content analysis to measure CSR disclosure. We proxy for information asymmetry with bid–ask spreads and calculate an implied cost of capital measure. Results reveal that CSR disclosure is significantly negatively associated with information asymmetry as well as cost of capital.

"Background: The emerging Artificial Intelligence (AI) based Conversational Agents (CA) capable of delivering evidence-based psychotherapy presents a unique opportunity to solve longstanding issues such as social stigma and demand-supply imbalance associated with traditional mental health care services. However, the emerging literature points to several socio-ethical challenges which may act as inhibitors to the adoption in the minds of the consumers. We also observe a paucity of research focusing on determinants of adoption and use of AI-based CAs in mental healthcare. In this setting, this study aims to understand the factors influencing the adoption and use of Intelligent CAs in mental healthcare by examining the perceptions of actual users. Method: The study followed a qualitative approach based on netnography and used a rigorous iterative thematic analysis of publicly available user reviews of popular mental health chatbots to develop a comprehensive framework of factors influencing the user’s decision to adopt mental healthcare CA. Results: We developed a comprehensive thematic map comprising of four main themes, namely, perceived risk, perceived benefits, trust, and perceived anthropomorphism, along with its 12 constituent subthemes that provides a visualization of the factors that govern the user’s adoption and use of mental healthcare CA. Conclusions: Insights from our research could guide future research on mental healthcare CA use behavior.

"Public relations’ (PR) professional habitus is defined by a relentless focus on optimism and futurity. This professional habitus renders PR indispensable to the corporate world after crisis, when new, potentially controversial, growth strategies must be sold-in to stakeholders.

"Advancements in human/AI interactions led to smartification of public services via the use of chatbots. Here, we present findings from a clinical inquiry research project in a key public service organisation in Norway. In this project, researchers and practitioners worked together to generate insights on the action possibilities offered to human service agents by chatbots and the potential for creating hybrid human/AI service teams. The project sensitised service agents to discover affordances based on their actual practices, rather than on the predefined use of chatbots. The different affordances identified can be useful for practitioners who design and deploy chatbot-based services. The action possibilities afforded by chatbots provide new ways for service agents and chatbots to work as a team addressing citizens’ needs.

"This paper investigates how drivers affect the development of eco-innovation in firms. Our research classifies the eco-innovation drivers in three categories: internal factors, market factors, and institutional factors. Using a sample with 9172 firms from the Spanish Innovation Survey Panel, we study the impact of eco-innovation drivers for energy and environmental efficiency objectives. This research utilizes a combination of two methods: Ordinal Logit Regression Models and Artificial Neural Networks. The results allow us to compare the impact of each variable. From a methodological point of view, this approach allows overcoming the difficulties of performing a regression analysis, mainly due to the low levels of explained variance and the problem of comparing the regression coefficients obtained.

"Unemployment rate is one of the most critical economic indicators. By analyzing and predicting unemployment rate, government officials can develop appropriate labor market related policies in response to the current economic situation. Accordingly, unemployment rate prediction has attracted a lot of attention from researchers in recent years. Themain contribution of this paper is the illustration of a novel ontology-basedWebmining framework that leverages search engine queries to improve the accuracy of unemployment rate prediction. The proposed framework is underpinned by a domain ontology which captures unemployment related concepts and their semantic relationships to facilitate the extraction of useful prediction features from relevant search engine queries. In addition, state-of-the-art feature selection methods and data mining models such as neural networks and support vector regressions are exploited to enhance the effectiveness of unemployment rate prediction. Our experimental results show that the proposed framework outperforms other baseline forecasting approaches that have been widely used for unemployment rate prediction.

"To constructively ameliorate and enhance traffic safety measures in Saudi Arabia, a prolific number of AI (Artificial Intelligence) traffic surveillance technologies have emerged, including Saher, throughout the past years. However, rapidly detecting a vehicle incident can play a cardinal role in ameliorating the response speed of incident management, which in turn minimizes road injuries that have been induced by the accident’s occurrence. To attain a permeating effect in increasing the entailed demand for road traffic security and safety, this paper presents a real-time traffic incident detection and alert system that is based on a computer vision approach. The proposed framework consists of three models, each of which is integrated within a prototype interface to fully visualize the system’s overall architecture. To begin, the vehicle detection and tracking model utilized the YOLOv5 object detector with the DeepSORT tracker to detect and track the vehicles’ movements by allocating a unique identification number (ID) to each vehicle. This model attained a mean average precision (mAP) of 99.2%. Second, a traffic accident and severity classification model attained a mAP of 83.3% while utilizing the YOLOv5 algorithm to accurately detect and classify an accident’s severity level, sending an immediate alert message to the nearest hospital if a severe accident has taken place. Finally, the ResNet152 algorithm was utilized to detect the ignition of a fire following the accident’s occurrence; this model achieved an accuracy rate of 98.9%, with an automated alert being sent to the fire station if this perilous event occurred.

"The advent of artificial intelligence (AI)-based technologies has opened new opportunities for manufacturers to maintain their technological edge and address pressing societal challenges. This research investigates the nature of the relationships between AI capabilities, servitization, and the role of absorptive capacity. Building on dynamic capabilities literature, we developed and empirically tested a model using structural equation modeling (SEM) and further applied a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). Through the construct of AI capabilities and its four sub-dimensions, we find supportive evidence from our model estimates employing data from 185 manufacturing firms in the US and EU. The study findings highlight the positive impact of AI capabilities on servitization; this relationship is positively moderated by absorptive capacity. Furthermore, the road to servitization is through advancing AI capabilities related to internal process and resource optimization coupled with AI for social innovation services.

"Whereas the concept of platform government emerged a decade ago and virtual states are predicted beginning early 2000s, supporting technologies and infrastructures are now being installed and implemented with highly integrative technologies such as cloud computing, big data analytics, mobile computing, social media, Internet of Things, and artificial intelligence. This realization of platform governments leads us to rethink what have been predicted decades ago. Time has come for us to really open up real opportunities by facing realistic challenges for public management. The pressure for government innovations, such as algorithmic bureaucracy and collaborative value creation, is increasing. Attentions need to be paid with respect to how the managerial role and activities are being transformed, how the nature of work in government is fundamentally changed, and how the decision-making processes are re-institutionalized. Further research issues are discussed at the end of this Viewpoint. Evidence for Practice: Platform governments predicted earlier are now being realized by highly integrative technologies such as cloud computing, big data analytics, social media, mobile computing, Internet of Things, and artificial intelligence. Platform government demands new approaches to public management, changes the nature of work of public managers, and reshapes the decision-making processes. Algorithmic bureaucracy provisioned by these new platformization will enable more anticipatory decision-making, require stronger leadership commitment on digitalization and innovation, and provide higher agility in public management.

"Artificial intelligence (AI) has been gaining significant attention in various fields to reduce costs, increase revenue, and improve customer satisfaction. AI can be particularly beneficial in enhancing decision-making processes for complex and ill-structured problems that lack transparency and have unclear goals. Most AI algorithms require labeled datasets to learn the problem characteristics, draw decision boundaries, and generalize. However, most datasets collected to solve complex and ill-structured problems do not have labels. Additionally, most AI algorithms are opaque and not easily interpretable, making it hard for decision-makers to obtain model insights for developing effective solution strategies. To this end, we examine existing AI paradigms, mainly symbolic AI (SAI) guided by human domain knowledge and data-driven AI (DAI) guided by data. We propose an approach called informed AI (IAI) by integrating human domain knowledge into AI to develop effective and reliable data labeling and model explainability processes. We demonstrate and validate the use of IAI by applying it to a social media dataset comprised of conversations between customers and customer support agents to construct a solution – IAI defect explorer (I-AIDE).

"Problem definition: In this research, we study how buyers’ use of artificial intelligence (AI) affects suppliers’ price quoting strategies. Specifically, we study the impact of automation—that is, the buyer uses a chatbot to automatically inquire about prices instead of asking in person—and the impact of smartness—that is, the buyer signals the use of a smart AI algorithm in selecting the supplier. Academic/practical relevance: In a world advancing toward AI, we explore how AI creates and delivers value in procurement. AI has two unique abilities: automation and smartness, which are associated with physical machines or software that enable us to operate more efficiently and effectively. Methodology: We collaborate with a trading company to run a field experiment on an online platform in which we compare suppliers’ wholesale price quotes across female, male, and chatbot buyer types under AI and no recommendation conditions. Results: We find that, when not equipped with a smart control, there is price discrimination against chatbot buyers who receive a higher wholesale price quote than human buyers. In fact, without smartness, automation alone receives the highest quoted wholesale price. However, signaling the use of a smart recommendation system can effectively reduce suppliers’ price quote for chatbot buyers. We also show that AI delivers the most value when buyers adopt automation and smartness simultaneously in procurement. Managerial implications: Our results imply that automation is not very valuable when implemented without smartness, which in turn suggests that building smartness is necessary before considering high levels of autonomy. Our study unlocks the optimal steps that buyers could adopt to develop AI in procurement processes. © 2021 INFORMS",-1,10.1287/msom.2021.0989,"This research examines how buyers' use of AI, specifically through chatbots and smart algorithms, influences suppliers' pricing strategies.

"This article addresses gaps about abductive reasoning—widely considered key to design-thinking but rarely detailed in design-thinking and innovation literatures—by examining two types of abduction; identifying impediments to it; and proposing the promise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to mitigate those impediments. Contrasting with the deductive and inductive approaches that dominant problem-solving, we distinguish and elucidate explanatory abduction and innovative abduction in problem finding, where the problem to solve is itself uncertain. We argue these are appropriate for generating innovative problem-finding ideas. Focusing thenceforth on problem finding alone, the heart of the article proposes a comprehensive conceptual model of innovative idea generation in that more ambiguous, complex, under-researched but exciting problem space. The model details three chief stages: (1) problem search frame, combining leadership’s vision and innovators’ knowledge; (2) generating abductive hypotheses from often-surprising observations and their synthesis into insights; and (3) evaluating abductive hypotheses, against the novel quality criteria of plausibility and relevance. Among cognitive impediments we show how the downsides of mental model, limited cognitive load and exemplifying heuristics and cognitive biases, such as confirmation bias, can hinder each stage.

"The evaluation of the impact of the adoption of industrial robotics on business is increasingly relevant in the current context of digital transformation. Although many companies are eager to adopt these technologies as a means to increase productivity, some concerns have been raised about the cost impact of the transformation, and its effect on the workforce. A growing body of literature is studying these phenomena but according to our review of it, there is no longitudinal perspective over 25 years illustrating the relationship between the attitude of companies to robotics and principal business indicators.

"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has brought unprecedented impacts (e.g., labor shortage, suspension and cancellation of projects, and disrupted supply and logistics) on the US construction industry. To address challenges caused by the pandemic, it is critical for the construction industry to develop a clear understanding of how the pandemic has affected the industry and how it will change in the future. However, assessing the impacts of COVID-19 on the construction industry is challenging due to the broad influence of the pandemic and the dynamic nature of the industry. The Purdue Index for Construction (Pi-C), which was developed as an indicator based on five dimensions and corresponding metrics to measure the health status of the construction industry, offers an opportunity to understand the impact of the pandemic. In this context, this paper presents a study to reveal the relationship between COVID-19 and the health status of the industry as measured through Pi-C and predict the future trend of the construction industry. This study achieves the objective via the three steps. First, the relationship between the pandemic and Pi-C metrics is identified using the Granger causality test and structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis. Second, multivariable prediction models are developed based on a long short-term memory (LSTM) network - a deep learning algorithm - to predict Pi-C metrics in the future. Third, forecasted Pi-C metrics are integrated into the existing Pi-C structure to analyze the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and predict its trends in 2021-2022. The results revealed that the impacts of the pandemic were conspicuous in two Pi-C dimensions (economy and stability), whereas no significant impacts were observed in the remaining Pi-C dimension (social).

"We examine the relationship between brand capital and stock price crash risk. Crash risk, defined as the negative skewness in the distribution of returns for individual stocks, captures asymmetry in risk, and has important implications for investment choices and risk management. Using a sample of 39,685 publicly listed U.S. firm-year observations covering 1975 to 2018, we show that brand capital is significantly and negatively related to crash risk. We also use an advanced machine learning approach and confirm that brand capital is a strong predictor of future stock price crashes. Our cross-sectional analyses show that this negative relationship is more evident for subsamples with transitory poor earnings performance or persistent good earnings performance, greater corporate tax avoidance, and weak corporate governance structures. The results survive numerous robustness tests, including the use of alternative measures of brand capital, crash risk, and several endogeneity tests.

"Can artificial intelligence (AI) assist human employees in increasing employee creativity? Drawing on research on AI–human collaboration, job design, and employee creativity, we examine AI assistance in the form of a sequential division of labor within organizations: in a task, AI handles the initial portion, which is well-codified and repetitive, and employees focus on the subsequent portion, involving higher-level problem-solving. First, we provide causal evidence from a field experiment conducted at a telemarketing company. We find that AI assistance in generating sales leads, on average, increases employees’ creativity in answering customers’ questions during subsequent sales persuasion. Enhanced creativity leads to increased sales. However, this effect is much more pronounced for higher-skilled employees. Next, we conducted a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews with the employees. We found that AI assistance changes job design by intensifying employees’ interactions with more serious customers. This change enables higher-skilled employees to generate innovative scripts and develop positive emotions at work, which are conducive to creativity. By contrast, with AI assistance, lower-skilled employees make limited improvements to scripts and experience negative emotions at work.

"The COVID-19 crisis has accelerated an already-ongoing process of massive digitalization in economic production and services. AI and robotics are getting, for the first time, autonomous and self-learning, with human-like capabilities. The discussion about digitalization and the future of work has become even more imperative. So far, labor unions were the leading institutions representing employees. However, the rising possibility of human substitution by intelligent machines puts in question the feasibility of labor unions’ policies. This development undermines their traditional power sources, which depend on the membership of masses of paid workers and on their ability to stop production. In this context, this paper aims to discuss the challenges confronting unions in capitalist democracies. Most scholarly literature on labor relations has embraced the assumption that the digital revolution will eventually bring new, better jobs. We suggest considering an alternative scenario, namely, a digital revolution that causes mass replacement of human workers and structural, technological unemployment, which might expand our point of view, particularly for designing public policy. We suggest that unions now have two crucial roles. The first is to safeguard workers' rights and interests in the transition from an economy based on paid labor to an economy based on automated-autonomous production; and second, they should transform their primary calling from representing employees to representing the social rights of all citizens, and particularly the material interests of lay people. © 2021 The Author(s)",-1,10.1016/j.techsoc.2021.101732,"This paper discusses the challenges labor unions face due to the rise of AI and robotics, particularly in the context of potential job displacement and structural unemployment.

"Cybersecurity has rapidly emerged as a grand societal challenge of the 21st century. Innovative solutions to proactively tackle emerging cybersecurity challenges are essential to ensuring a safe and secure society. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has rapidly emerged as a viable approach for sifting through terabytes of heterogeneous cybersecurity data to execute fundamental cybersecurity tasks, such as asset prioritization, control allocation, vulnerability management, and threat detection, with unprecedented efficiency and effectiveness. Despite its initial promise, AI and cybersecurity have been traditionally siloed disciplines that relied on disparate knowledge and methodologies. Consequently, the AI for Cybersecurity discipline is in its nascency. In this article, we aim to provide an important step to progress the AI for Cybersecurity discipline.

"People rapidly and subconsciously process information from facial images. On sharing economy platforms, facial cues can provide a useful supplement to other information provided by reputation systems. Previous small-scale, rater-informed studies examining trust and attractiveness based on facial features on Airbnb found mixed support for impacts on pricing. We re-examine their impact using deep learning to classify host faces for an extensive data set of Airbnb accommodation in 10 US cities (n = 78,215). Together, trust and attractiveness contribute to almost a 5% increase in prices for Airbnb accommodation. We also test Gray's theory of motivation via the examination of pricing for different types of accommodation, finding that trust is more important in situations of smaller accommodation shared with strangers. The paper concludes with limitations and implications for research and practice. © 2020",-1,10.1016/j.tourman.2020.104235,"This paper uses deep learning to analyze the impact of facial cues on pricing in Airbnb accommodations, focusing on trust and attractiveness.

"Purpose: This study examines consumers' evaluations of product consumption values, purchase intentions and willingness to pay for fashion products designed using generative adversarial network (GAN), an artificial intelligence technology. This research investigates differences between consumers' evaluations of a GAN-generated product and a non-GAN-generated product and tests whether disclosing the use of GAN technology affects consumers' evaluations. Design/methodology/approach: Sample products were developed as experimental stimuli using cycleGAN. Data were collected from 163 members of Generation Y. Participants were assigned to one of the three experimental conditions (i.e. non-GAN-generated images, GAN-generated images with disclosure and GAN-generated images without disclosure). Regression analysis and ANOVA were used to test the hypotheses. Findings: Functional, social and epistemic consumption values positively affect willingness to pay in the GAN-generated products. Relative to non-GAN-generated products, willingness to pay is significantly higher for GAN-generated products. Moreover, evaluations of functional value, emotional value and willingness to pay are highest when GAN technology is used, but not disclosed. Originality/value: This study evaluates the utility of GANs from consumers' perspective based on the perceived value of GAN-generated product designs.

"Is it possible to predict malfeasance in public procurement? With the proliferation of e-procurement systems in the public sector, anti-corruption agencies and watchdog organizations have access to valuable sources of information with which to identify transactions that are likely to become troublesome and why. In this article, we discuss the promises and challenges of using machine learning models to predict inefficiency and corruption in public procurement. We illustrate this approach with a dataset with more than two million public procurement contracts in Colombia. We trained machine learning models to predict which of them will result in corruption investigations, a breach of contract, or implementation inefficiencies. We then discuss how our models can help practitioners better understand the drivers of corruption and inefficiency in public procurement. Our approach will be useful to governments interested in exploiting large administrative datasets to improve the provision of public goods, and it highlights some of the tradeoffs and challenges that they might face throughout this process. © 2020 International Institute of Forecasters",-1,10.1016/j.ijforecast.2020.06.006,"This paper discusses the use of machine learning models to predict malfeasance in public procurement, utilizing a dataset of over two million contracts in Colombia.

"Trust and privacy have emerged as significant concerns in online transactions. Sharing information on health is especially sensitive but it is necessary for purchasing and utilizing health insurance. Evidence shows that consumers are increasingly comfortable with technology in place of humans, but the expanding use of AI potentially changes this. This research explores whether trust and privacy concern are barriers to the adoption of AI in health insurance. Two scenarios are compared: The first scenario has limited AI that is not in the interface and its presence is not explicitly revealed to the consumer. In the second scenario there is an AI interface and AI evaluation, and this is explicitly revealed to the consumer. The two scenarios were modeled and compared using SEM PLS-MGA. The findings show that trust is significantly lower in the second scenario where AI is visible.

"This research proposes and tests mechanisms for defining and identifying the critical online consumer reviews that firms could prioritize to optimize their online response strategies, while incorporating the latest artificial intelligence (AI) technology to deal with the overwhelming volume of information. Three sets of analytical tools are introduced: Heuristic Processing, Linguistic Feature Analysis, and Deep Learning-based Natural Language Processing (NLP), to extract review information. Twelve algorithms to classify critical reviews were developed accordingly and empirically tested for their effectiveness. Our econometric analysis of 110,146 online reviews from a chain operation in hospitality industry over seven years identifies six outstanding algorithms. Firm value rating, comment length, valence, and certain consumer emotions, in addition to past comment-response behavior, are found to be superior in predicting incoming review criticality.

"Deepfakes—artificial but hyper-realistic video, audio, and images created by algorithms—are one of the latest technological developments in artificial intelligence. Amplified by the speed and scope of social media, they can quickly reach millions of people and result in a wide range of marketplace deceptions. However, extant understandings of deepfakes’ implications in the marketplace are limited and fragmented. Against this background, we develop insights into the significance of deepfakes for firms and consumers—the threats they pose, how to mitigate those threats, and the opportunities they present. Our findings indicate that the main risks to firms include damage to image, reputation, and trustworthiness and the rapid obsolescence of existing technologies. However, consumers may also suffer blackmail, bullying, defamation, harassment, identity theft, intimidation, and revenge porn.

"Research Summary: In this article, we examine the relationship between corporate diversification and firm performance using a machine learning technique called natural language processing (NLP). By applying a widely used NLP technique called topic modeling to unstructured text from annual reports, we create a new, multidimensional measure that captures the degree of diversification of both multisegment and single-segment firms. Additionally, we introduce a novel method to incorporate human judgments into the interpretation of machine-learned patterns, which allows us to measure diversification across multiple dimensions, such as products and geographies. Finally, we illustrate how these new measures can generate novel insights into the relationship between the degree and type of diversification and firm performance, furthering our understanding of the diversification–performance relationship. Managerial Summary: At some point, most firms face dilemmas about whether to diversify their business activities across industries or geographic markets—an important decision that invariably affects firm performance. Albeit very important, the direction of a relationship between diversification and firm performance is not always clear. Inconsistent results of previous studies are partially driven by inherent difficulties in reliably measuring diversification. This study introduces a novel methodology to address that problem: a machine learning-based technique to quantify diversification from unstructured corporate annual report texts. An analysis of firm performance based on these novel diversification measures suggests that diversification, in contrast to earlier studies that find a diversification discount, is associated with higher firm value—a premium particularly pronounced for firms diversifying within a single industry. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",-1,10.1002/smj.3317,"This paper employs natural language processing (NLP) to analyze the relationship between corporate diversification and firm performance.

"Will consumers accept artificial intelligence (AI) as a medical care provider? On the basis of evolution theory, we investigate the implicit psychological mechanisms that underlie consumers’ interactions with medical AI and a human doctor. In a behavioral investigation (Study 1), consumers expressed a positive intention to use medical AI's healthcare services when it used personalized rather than mechanical conversation. However, neural investigation (Study 2) using functional magnetic resonance imaging revealed that some consumers’ implicit attitudes toward medical AI differed from their expressed behavioral intentions. The brain areas linked with implicitly apathetic emotions were activated even when medical AI used a personalized conversation, whereas consumers’ brains were activated in areas associated with prosociality when they interacted with a human doctor who used a personalized conversation. On the basis of our neural evidence, consumers perceive an identical personalized conversation differently when it is offered by a medical AI versus a human doctor. These findings have implications for the area of human–AI interactions and medical decision-making and suggest that replacing human doctors with medical AI is still an unrealistic proposition. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC",-1,10.1002/mar.21445,"This paper examines consumer acceptance of AI as a medical care provider, utilizing both behavioral and neural investigations to understand implicit attitudes.

"Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to machines that are trained to perform tasks associated with human intelligence, interpret external data, learn from that external data, and use that learning to flexibly adapt to tasks to achieve specific outcomes. This paper briefly explains AI and looks into the future to highlight some of AI's broader and longer-term societal implications. We propose that AI can be combined with entrepreneurship to represent a super tool. Scholars can research the nexus of AI and entrepreneurship to explore the possibilities of this potential AI-entrepreneurship super tool and hopefully direct its use to productive processes and outcomes. We focus on specific entrepreneurship topics that benefit from AI's augmentation potential and acknowledge implications for entrepreneurship's dark side. We hope this paper stimulates future research at the AI-entrepreneurship nexus. Executive summary: Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to machines that are trained to perform tasks associated with human intelligence, interpret external data, learn from that external data, and use that learning to flexibly adapt to tasks to achieve specific outcomes. Machine learning is the most common form of AI and largely relies on supervised learning—when the machine (i.e., AI) is trained with labels applied by humans. Deep learning and adversarial learning involve training on unlabeled data, or when the machine (via its algorithms) clusters data to reveal underlying patterns. AI is simply a tool. Entrepreneurship is also simply a tool. How they are combined and used will determine their impact on humanity. While researchers have independently developed a greater understanding of entrepreneurship and AI, these two streams of research have primarily run in parallel. To indicate the scope of current and future AI, we provide examples of AI (at different levels of development) for four sectors—customer service, financial, healthcare, and tertiary education. Indeed, experts from industry research and consulting firms suggest many AI-related business opportunities for entrepreneurs to pursue. Further, we elaborate on several of these opportunities, including opportunities to (1) capitalize on the “feeling economy,” (2) redistribute occupational skills in the economy, (3) develop and use new governance mechanisms, (4) keep humans in the loop (i.e., humans as part of the decision making process), (5) expand the role of humans in developing AI systems, and (6) expand the purposes of AI as a tool. After discussing the range of business opportunities that experts suggest will prevail in the economy with AI, we discuss how entrepreneurs can use AI as a tool to help them increase their chances of entrepreneurial success. We focus on four up-and-coming areas for entrepreneurship research: a more interaction-based perspective of (potential) entrepreneurial opportunities, a more activities-based micro-foundation approach to entrepreneurial action, a more cognitively hot perspective of entrepreneurial decision making and action, and a more compassionate and prosocial role of entrepreneurial action. As we discuss each topic, we also suggest opportunities to design an AI system (i.e., entrepreneurs as potential AI designers) to help entrepreneurs (i.e., entrepreneurs as AI users). AI is an exciting development in the technology world. How it transforms markets and societies depends in large part on entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs can use AI to augment their decisions and actions in pursuing potential opportunities for productive gains. Thus, we discuss entrepreneurs' most critical tasks in developing and managing AI and explore some of the dark-side aspects of AI. Scholars also have a role to play in how entrepreneurs use AI, but this role requires the hard work of theory building, theory elaboration, theory testing, and empirical theorizing. We offer some AI topics that we hope future entrepreneurship research will explore.

"The virtual assistants' market is drastically growing and is expected to reach $2.1 billion by 2020. Nonetheless, the quick expansion and high penetration of e-retailers’ AI ecosystem into the shopper's journey is still under-researched in the extant literature. Amazon's Alexa in particular has been fast proliferating into the customer's journey, favoring the development of captive audiences given this new ambient environment. Through a mixed methodology using both qualitative and quantitative approaches, this study examines Amazon's captive relationship strategy on shoppers, brands and competing retailers. The research findings show that Amazon's AI relationship strategy with its customers is based on forming a multi-faceted identity for the AI that would later on facilitate a captive situation that would lead to an addictive relationship.

"Despite the substantial economic impact of the restaurant industry, large-scale empirical research on restaurant survival has been sparse. We investigate whether consumer-posted photos can serve as a leading indicator of restaurant survival above and beyond reviews, firm characteristics, competitive landscape, and macroconditions. We employ machine learning techniques to extract features from 755, 758 photos and 1, 121, 069 reviews posted on Yelp between 2004 and 2015 for 17, 719 U.S. restaurants. We also collect data on restaurant characteristics (e.g., cuisine type, price level) and competitive landscape as well as entry and exit (if applicable) time from each restaurant’s Yelp/Facebook page, own website, or Google search engine. Using a predictive XGBoost algorithm, we find that consumer-posted photos are strong predictors of restaurant survival. Interestingly, the informativeness of photos (e.g., the proportion of food photos) relates more to restaurant survival than do photographic attributes (e.g., composition, brightness). Additionally, photos carry more predictive power for independent, young or mid-aged, and medium-priced restaurants. Assuming that restaurant owners possess no knowledge about future photos and reviews, photos can predict restaurant survival for up to three years, whereas reviews are only predictive for one year. We further employ causal forests to facilitate the interpretation of our predictive results. Among photo content variables, the proportion of food photos has the largest positive association with restaurant survival, followed by proportions of outside and interior photos. Among others, the proportion of photos with helpful votes also positively relates to restaurant survival. © 2022 INFORMS.",-1,10.1287/mnsc.2022.4359,"This paper examines the predictive power of consumer-posted photos on restaurant survival, utilizing machine learning techniques to analyze a large dataset from Yelp.

"The article examines a number of ways in which the use of artificial intelligence technologies to predict the performance of individuals and to reach decisions concerning the entitlement of individuals to positive decisions impacts individuals and society. It analyses the effects using a social justice lens. Particular attention is paid to the experiences of individuals who have historically experienced disadvantage and discrimination. The article uses the university admissions process where the university utilises a fully automated decision-making process to evaluate the capability or suitability of the candidate as a case study. The article posits that the artificial intelligence decision-making process should be viewed as an institution that reconfigures the relationships between individuals, and between individuals and institutions. Artificial intelligence decision-making processes have institutional elements embedded within them that result in their operation disadvantaging groups who have historically experienced discrimination. Depending on the manner in which an artificial intelligence decision-making process is designed, it can produce solidarity or segregation between groups in society. There is a potential for the operation of artificial intelligence decision-making processes to fail to reflect the lived experiences of individuals and as a result to undermine the protection of human diversity. Some of these effects are linked to the creation of an ableist culture and to the resurrection of eugenics-type discourses. It is concluded that one of the contexts in which human beings should reach decisions is where the decision involves representing and evaluating the capabilities of an individual.

"Explosive growth in big data technologies and artificial intelligence (AI) applications have led to increasing pervasiveness of information facets and a rapidly growing array of information representations. Information facets, such as equivocality and veracity, can dominate and significantly influence human perceptions of information and consequently affect human performance. Extant research in cognitive fit, which preceded the big data and AI era, focused on the effects of aligning information representation and task on performance, without sufficient consideration to information facets and attendant cognitive challenges. Therefore, there is a compelling need to understand the interplay of these dominant information facets with information representations and tasks, and their influence on human performance. We suggest that artificially intelligent technologies that can adapt information representations to overcome cognitive limitations are necessary for these complex information environments. To this end, we propose and test a novel “Adaptive Cognitive Fit” (ACF) framework that explains the influence of information facets and AI-augmented information representations on human performance.

Rapid advances in technology, including the expansion of digital government, the use of artificial intelligence, and the ability to collect and analyze big data, promise to make public sector organizations leaner, more efficient, and more responsive to citizens' needs. While these technological changes have prompted some observers to forecast the end of bureaucracy, data from many countries show that bureaucratic public organizations are not disappearing.

"Purpose: This article analyzes the effects of artificial intelligence (AI) stimuli on customer engagement as well as on value co-creation. The moderating role played by customer ability readiness is also examined. Design/methodology/approach: Total 426 questioners are collected from the customers who consumed intelligent service robot. Findings: First, the perceived interactivity (PI) of AI stimuli have a significant positive impact on value co-creation; second, customer engagement plays a mediating effect on the relationship between PI and value co-creation; finally, customer ability readiness has a positive moderating effect on the relationship between AI stimuli, customer engagement and value co-creation. Research limitations/implications: Firstly, the method of questionnaire survey has certain limitations, In future research, more advanced survey methods (such as social perception calculations) can be used to make survey samples more comprehensive and analysis results more accurate. Secondly, the paper used a single-dimensional test for the two variables of customer engagement and value co-creation. Future research should divide the dimensions of customer engagement and value co-creation into more specific way. Finally, this study lacks research on the regulatory effect of customer ability readiness and further division of customer readiness. Practical implications: First, this paper uses the arousal theory to participate in marketing theory and value co-creation theory, which is the cross and fusion of theory, and also the enrichment and expansion of the existing theoretical research, with a certain theoretical innovation. Second, based on previous research, this research developed and designed a measurement scale for AI stimuli. Finally, through empirical research, it is found that the perceived personalization of AI stimuli does not have a significant direct effect on value co-creation, which is a new views and insight. Social implications: First, when using intelligent customer service robots, companies should pay attention to improving the PI and personalization of intelligent customer service robots.

"Big data, algorithms and artificial intelligence now allow employers to process information on their employees and potential employees in a far more efficient manner and at a much lower cost than in the past. This makes it possible to profile workers automatically and even allows technology itself to replace human resources personnel in making decisions that have legal effects on employees (recruitment, promotion, dismissals, etc.). This entails great risks of worker discrimination and defencelessness, with workers unaware of the reasons underlying any such decision. This article analyses the protections established in the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for safeguarding employees against discrimination.

"Many companies are currently investing in artificial intelligence (AI) because of its potential to increase customer satisfaction or financial performance. However, the success rates in implementing AI systems are low, partly due to technology-centric approaches that neglect work practices. This study draws on Bourdieu’s theory of practice to highlight the potential power shift related to AI in customer relationship management, based on the concepts field, capital, and habitus. Two longitudinal case studies were conducted to understand the power shift related to AI implementation. These two AI systems were designed with the objective to support employees. However, subsequently, their implementation changed the balance of power with a significant shift towards more management control, resulting in a devaluation of employees’ work practices.

"Purpose: The measure of companies' Innovation Performance is fundamental for enhancing the value and decision-making processes of firms. The purpose of this paper is to present a new measure of Innovation Performance, called Innovation Patent Index (IPI), which makes it possible to quantitatively summarize different aspects of firms' innovation. Design/methodology/approach: In order to define the IPI, a secondary source, i.e. patent data, has been used. The five dimensions of IPI, i.e. efficiency, time, diversification, quality and internationalization have been defined both analyzing the literature and applying three different machine learning algorithms (regularized least squares, deep neural networks and decision trees), considering patent forward citations as a proxy of the innovation performance. Findings: Results show that the IPI index is a very useful tool, simple to use and very promptly. In fact, it is possible to get important results without making time consuming analysis with primary sources. It is a tool that can be used by managers, businessmen, policymakers, organizations, patent experts and financiers to evaluate and plan future activities, to enhance the innovation capability, to find financing and to support and improve innovation. Research limitations/implications: Patent data are not widely used in all the sectors. Moreover, the pure number of forward citations is not the only forward looking indicator suggested by the literature. Originality/value: The demand for a useable Innovation Performance tool, as well as the lack of tools able to grasp different aspects of the innovation, highlight the need to develop new instruments.

"Purpose: This study aims to examine customers’ willingness to engage in service interactions enabled by artificial intelligence (AI) controlled voice assistants (VA). Drawing on the tenets of dual-factor theory, this study measures the impact of both enablers and inhibitors – mediated by trust in Alexa – on customers’ intentions to transact through VAs. Design/methodology/approach: Data from a survey of 290 users of VAs from Japan was collected through “Macromill”. The authors used a covariance-based path analysis technique for data analysis after establishing the validity and reliability of the measures. Findings: The results of this study demonstrate that convenience and status-seeking act as enablers and positively influence trust in VAs, whereas risk barrier acts as an inhibitor and negatively influence trust in VAs. In turn, trust in VAs positively influences the intention to use VAs for transactional service interactions. This association is positively moderated by technology comfort.

"A rising elderly population and diminishing number of family and professional carers has led to calls for the intervention of care robots. This leaves the quality of robot-delivered care to be determined by designers, for profit companies, nursing codes of practice and conduct, potential user sample groups, etc. What is missing is the carer who consciously makes good ethical decisions during practice. Good care is ‘determinative in practice’. That is, a carer can make good decisions because they are making them within the carer-patient relationship. If a robot is to be capable of good care ethics on the same level as humans, it needs to be conscious and able to make dynamic decisions in practice. Moreover, a care robot must conduct patient interactions in appropriate ways, tailored to the person in its care, at run-time. This is because good care, as well as being determinative in practice, is tailored to the individual. The introduction of robotic care determined by limited stakeholders leaves customised care in danger and instead could potentially turn the quality of elderly care into ‘elderly management’. This study introduces a new care robot framework—the attentive framework—which suggests using care centred value sensitive design (CCVSD) for the design process, as well as a computationally conscious information system (IS) to make practice-determinative decisions in run-time with extrinsic care value ordering. Although VSD has been extensively researched in the IS literature, CCVSD has not. The results of this study suggest that this new care robot framework, which is inspired by CCVSD, is competent in determining good, customised patient care at run-time.

"One type of data-driven innovations in management is data-driven decision making. Confronted with a big amount of data external and internal to their organization's managers strive for predictive data analysis that enables insight into the future, but even more for prescriptive ones that use algorithms to prepare recommendations for current and future actions. Most of the decision-making techniques use deterministic machine learning (ML) techniques but unfortunately, they do not take into account the variety and volatility of decision-making situations and do not allow for a more flexible approach, i.e., adjusted to changing environmental conditions or changing management priorities. A way to better adapt ML tools to the needs of decision-makers is to use swarm intelligence ML (SIML) methods that provide a set of alternative solutions that allow matching actions with the current decision-making situation. Thus, applying SIML methods in managerial decision-making is conceptualized as a company capability as it allows for systematic alignment of allocating resources decisions vis-à -vis changing decision-making conditions. The study focuses on the customer churn management as the area of applying SIML techniques to managerial decision-making. The objectives are twofold: to present the specific features and the role of SIML methods in customer churn management and to test if a modified SIML algorithm may increase the effectiveness of churn-related segmentation and improve decision-making process. The empirical study uses publicly available customer data related to digital markets to test if and how SIML methods facilitate managerial decision-making with regard to customers potentially leaving the company in the context of changing conditions.

"To date, entrepreneurship researchers have tended to avoid state-of-the-art artificial intelligence techniques; in this paper, we fill that gap. Based on eclectic entrepreneurship theory, we present an original work that uses artificial intelligence to forecast the macrolevel determinants of entrepreneurial opportunity. Modern artificial intelligence could open new areas for future research opportunities in entrepreneurship and help close the gap between theory and practice. Our empirical analysis offers two major results by using a panel dataset of 149 countries covering 2007–2018 and six machine-learning models. First, entrepreneurs prefer to exploit opportunities in countries with stable economic governance that provide high education standards, health, social capital, and a safe, natural environment. Second, CatBoost regression performs better in predicting entrepreneurial opportunity compared to linear regression and more advanced machine-learning models.

"Ecosystems are typically evaluated and understood using standard visible material metrics, such as new products, patents, startups, VC funding, jobs, and successful exits. Yet emerging entrepreneurial ecosystems (EEEs) provide many possibilities for members not signaled by such visible markers. Consequently, policymakers may have a difficult time making informed decisions about incentives and regulations to foster economic growth through ecosystem emergence. To address this methods and measurement issue, we conceptualize emerging systems using both cultural and material approaches to develop a comparative typology and apply it to an emerging regional ecosystem growing around artificial intelligence (AI).

"The rise of live-streaming e-commerce has attracted the wide participation of online influencers, brands, and retailers. Live streamers offer a fresh shopping experience to consumers through broadcasting product demonstrations and communicating with them. This study characterizes the streamers’ behavior and explores the key drivers of live-streaming e-commerce success as measured by gross merchandise value (GMV) and fan growth. We employ both machine learning and econometric methods to analyze a unique dataset of 55,096 shows by the top 1,000 live streamers on Alibaba's live streaming platform. We identify three distinct clusters. The most important differentiating features include a live streamer's platform affiliation and product category. Selling more products and spending more time on each product in a live-streaming show are two factors driving both GMV and fan growth.

"Research has become the main reference point for academic life in modern universities. Research incentives have been a controversial issue, because of the difficulty of identifying who are the main beneficiaries and what are the long-term effects. Still, new policies including financial incentives have been adopted to increase the research output at all possible levels. Little literature has been devoted to the response to those incentives. To bridge this gap, we carry out our analysis with data of a six years program developed in Madrid (Spain). Instead of using a traditional econometric approach, we design a machine learning multilevel model to discover on whom, when, and for how long those policies have an effect. The empirical model consists of an automated nested longitudinal clustering (ANLC) performed in two stages. Firstly, it performs a stratification of academics, and secondly, it performs a longitudinal segmentation for each group. The second part considers the researchers’ sociodemographic, academic information and the evolution of their performance over time in the form of the annual percentage variation of their marks over the period. The new methodology, whose robustness is tested with a multilayer perceptron artificial neural network with a back-propagation learning algorithm, shows that tenure track researchers present a better response to incentives than tenured researches, and also that gender plays an important role in academia.

"Though artificial intelligence (AI) recommendation is a hot topic in recent marketing research, previous research has shown a convergent tendency for aversion to AI recommendation. It is imperative to find ways to promote AI usage and reduce consumers’ AI aversion. This study fills this void by exploring the effect of AI (vs. human) recommenders on consumers’ preferences for search versus experience products in the context of e-commerce. Two studies provide convergent evidence that consumers show less avoidance of algorithms when recommending search products compared to experience products. A behavioral experiment (Study 1, N = 112) validates that consumers are less likely to purchase experience products recommended by AI, while there are no significant differences between AI versus human recommenders when recommending search products. Using event-related potential (ERP), a further consumer neuroscience study (Study 2, N = 26) shows that consumers have a higher level of cognitive conflict (i.e., a larger magnitude of N2) when AI (vs. human) recommends experience products, while the effect disappears for search products. This paper shows that for search products, marketers can obtain similar evaluations using AI recommenders, which is relatively cheaper and more time-saving compared with human recommenders.

"Key Enabling Technologies (KETs) are pervasive groups of technologies expected to enable innovation. They have been promoted as technologies with tremendous potential for boosting economic growth and sustainability in all sectors of society – a claim whose validity remains underexplored. Building on systems thinking and the Multi-Level Perspective, we develop a novel approach to assess the socio-technical impact of a KET regime on a transitioning sectoral regime. This approach is applied to the case of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) KET impacting the decarbonization of the energy-intensive steel industry. To assess AI's technical impact, we compiled an inventory of AI tools based on reviewing technical scientific articles. Our analysis shows that AI adds technological value to the full range of areas in the steel industry, like predicting process parameters; optimizing operations, scheduling, and electrical energy; and forecasting product demand, quality, and site emissions. Semi-structured interviews were the primary data source to assess AI's broader socio-institutional impact. The results indicate that AI may currently be reinforcing path dependencies of the steel industry, as AI tools are more focused on incremental improvement for existing technologies rather than novel low-carbon technologies. However, AI also offers capabilities to reduce barriers to sustainability innovation, like system integration challenges, flexibility challenges, demand-side barriers, and risk-related barriers. Finally, we reflect on the generalizability of our approach for studying other transitions, and we induce characteristics of the AI-Digital KET regimes.

"In recent years, marketers have placed increased reliance upon artificial intelligence (AI) and, subsequently, the use of virtual agents in customer service contexts is on the rise. Despite such service digitalization, service can still fail. While there is an increasing literature on the effect of virtual agents in service settings, questions remain as to how customers react to service failure that results from interactions with virtual service agents. To this end, we deconstruct the effect of virtual agent service failure across two studies: one involving a process service failure and another involving an outcome service failure. We specifically manipulate the type of service agent that causes the service failure (human vs. virtual agent) and the magnitude of the failure (small vs. large). Results show that firms can leverage virtual service agents to mitigate or buffer the negative effects of service failure. From a managerial perspective, our findings suggest that firms could engage virtual service agents in situations where there may be a risk of outcome service failure—particularly in settings where relatively large magnitude failures may be experienced. In such a setting, we find that virtual service agents can mitigate the negative effects of service failure, more so than when the failure results from an interaction with a human service agent. © 2022 The Authors.

"Purpose: A vast body of literature has documented the negative consequences of stress on employee performance and well-being. These deleterious effects are particularly pronounced for service agents who need to constantly endure and manage customer emotions. The purpose of this paper is to introduce and describe a deep learning model to predict in real-time service agent stress from emotion patterns in voice-to-voice service interactions. Design/methodology/approach: A deep learning model was developed to identify emotion patterns in call center interactions based on 363 recorded service interactions, subdivided in 27,889 manually expert-labeled three-second audio snippets. In a second step, the deep learning model was deployed in a call center for a period of one month to be further trained by the data collected from 40 service agents in another 4,672 service interactions. Findings: The deep learning emotion classifier reached a balanced accuracy of 68% in predicting discrete emotions in service interactions. Integrating this model in a binary classification model, it was able to predict service agent stress with a balanced accuracy of 80%. Practical implications: Service managers can benefit from employing the deep learning model to continuously and unobtrusively monitor the stress level of their service agents with numerous practical applications, including real-time early warning systems for service agents, customized training and automatically linking stress to customer-related outcomes. Originality/value: The present study is the first to document an artificial intelligence (AI)-based model that is able to identify emotions in natural (i.e. nonstaged) interactions.

"Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are rapidly changing the competitive landscape. In the search for an appropriate strategic response, firms are currently engaging in a large variety of AI projects. However, recent studies suggest that many companies are falling short in creating tangible business value through AI. As the current scientific body of knowledge lacks empirically-grounded research studies for explaining this phenomenon, we conducted an exploratory interview study focusing on 56 applications of machine learning (ML) in 29 different companies. Through an inductive qualitative analysis, we uncover three broad types and five subtypes of ML value creation mechanisms, identify necessary but not sufficient conditions for successfully leveraging them, and observe that organizations, in their efforts to create value, dynamically shift from one ML value creation mechanism to another by reconfiguring their ML applications (i.e., the shifting practice).

"The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has grown rapidly in the service industry and AI’s emotional capabilities have become an important feature for interacting with customers. The current research examines personal disclosures that occur during consumer interactions with AI and humans in service settings. We found that consumers’ lay beliefs about AI (i.e., a perceived lack of social judgment capability) lead to enhanced disclosure of sensitive personal information to AI (vs. humans). We identify boundaries for this effect such that consumers prefer disclosure to humans over AI in (i) contexts where social support (rather than social judgment) is expected and (ii) contexts where sensitive information will be curated by the agent for social dissemination. In addition, we reveal underlying psychological processes such that the motivation to avoid negative social judgment favors disclosing to AI whereas seeking emotional support favors disclosing to humans. Moreover, we reveal that adding humanlike factors to AI can increase consumer fear of social judgment (reducing disclosure in contexts of social risk) while simultaneously increasing perceived AI capacity for empathy (increasing disclosure in contexts of social support).

"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is shaping marketing in an unprecedented way. Empowered by AI, voice assistants are increasingly capable of speaking and listening like humans, offering a great opportunity for a new marketing approach - voice marketing. This research examines how conversation attributes of voice assistants determine consumer trust and intention to engage in voice shopping. Using a sequential mixed-method design, three studies consistently show that consumers perceive the speaking attribute of voice assistants as more human-like than the listening attribute. We find that such incongruency between the two conversation attributes can undermine consumers' trust in voice assistants, leading to reduced willingness to accept product recommendations from voice assistants and shop via voice assistants, which would hamper the development of voice marketing. Accordingly, this research suggests that AI giants with strong technological strength and capital support should distribute more resources to advance the underlying technologies enabling human-like listening (e.g., natural language understanding and voice recognition).

"We propose an automated triage design for intelligent customer routing in live-chat contact centers and demonstrate its implementation using a real-world data set from an S&P 500 firm. The proposed design emerges as a synthesis of text analytics and predictive machine learning methods. Using numerical experiments based on the simulation of the firm's contact center, we demonstrate the service level, time, and labor cost benefits of the automated design over two other triage designs (i.e., customer choice triage and human expert triage) that are commonly employed in the real world. Through additional analyses, we explore the generalizability of the automated design for creating solutions for different types of communication channels.

"Artificial intelligence increasingly forms an essential context for the distribution of power within workplaces. Using the case study of an AI-enabled chatbot initially created by IBM and subsequently developed by an alt-labour network in the United States and a traditional union in Australia, this article outlines several distinctive ways in which the chatbot increased union resources and capabilities. Once reconfigured to reflect an ‘organising’, rather than ‘servicing’ ethos, the chatbot became an infrastructural resource that enabled otherwise marginal workers to receive basic information in a manner that reinforced union narratives of power and worker solidarity, and workplaces to be mapped more efficiently. The chatbot did not act as a labour saving tool, but stimulated wide-ranging learning by bringing implicit tensions between ‘servicing’ and ‘organising’ conceptions of knowledge, power and expertise to the surface. Chatbots thus offer distinctive potential affordances to unions in enhancing their resources and capabilities as ‘orchestrators’ of worker power. © 2020 Brian Towers (BRITOW) and John Wiley & Sons Ltd",-1,10.1111/ntwe.12178,"This paper examines the role of an AI-enabled chatbot in enhancing union resources and capabilities, focusing on its impact on worker power and solidarity.

"Technologies like computer vision, advanced sensors, internet of things, 3D printing, big data, or artificial intelligence are penetrating all facets of the industrial value chains. Hence, industry is engaged in an accelerated automation race where industrial automation converts value chains into intelligent, data-driven systems. This generates new business models and spurs firm competitiveness in general. Companies thus pay attention to the development, acquisition, and incorporation of related technologies to profit from these developments in specific. For this, they must incorporate external flows of knowledge to succeed in innovation. Yet, there is a dearth of research that links open innovation to the incorporation of industrial automation, and to firm performance. Hence, this paper takes a knowledge-based view of the firm and sheds light on the moderating role of the processes of open innovation on the economic results of firms’ subject to automation. In order to do so, we estimate the impact of the interaction of open innovation and automation on firm turnover using panel data for 5287 Spanish firms from a variety of manufacture and service industries. We separate the effects for different open-innovation partners and find that turnover is increased for those automating firms that engage in open innovation with suppliers. These results indicate that suppliers possess the knowledge required for successful automation, and firms that innovate together with suppliers fare better at leveraging investments in automation. In addition, automating firms should exercise caution when choosing collaboration partners from the same country. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",-1,10.1007/s11846-018-0294-z,"This paper examines the relationship between open innovation and industrial automation, focusing on how these factors influence firm performance, specifically turnover.

"Purpose: Retail networks present new challenges in the business-to-business (B2B) collaboration between technology-based spinoffs and traditional businesses. This study aims to explore a public–private partnership (PPP) that leverages advanced digital technologies via spinoffs to tackle the key challenge of showrooming that retail shops are facing. Showrooming is the phenomenon in which shoppers go to the physical stores to gather in-depth product information, and later on, decide to buy the product from online retail competitors. Design/methodology/approach: This research draws on a longitudinal qualitative study of a social context in which digital entrepreneurs are embedded. The empirical setting is a retail network in Italy, Germany and Finland with a particular focus on the process in which a PPP delivers innovation via spinoffs in the context of brick and mortar shops (B&M). The research design enables an understanding of the complexity of the phenomenon from a business and a social perspective. Findings: New technology to tackle showrooming enables the creation of substantial hybrid value in retail partnerships. Spinoffs are key actors in leveraging digital technologies to create value faster and more tailored compared with large software companies. Spinoff entrepreneurs leverage on specific technologies (e.g. virtual reality and artificial intelligence) available inside organizations’ network (i.e. PPPs). Spinoffs are found to be a fundamental actor in the process of dealing with showrooming because of their time to market. Large software companies usually are not interested in approaching B&M shops because of the high operational costs of product customization for B&M shops. Practical implications: Managers could use the success factors of the spinoffs in helping their B&M shops to improve both shopper experience and salesperson performance. For managers of B2B retail network, the results are useful towards increasing the involvement of shoppers while they are visiting physical stores, and it also improves salesperson performance. It also leads to the observation that cross-selling is one of the most effective responses to the phenomenon of showrooming. As practical implications for policymakers, the current research supports the view that PPPs should support the creation of spinoffs as a result of longitudinal innovation projects. Social implications: Retail technologies leveraged from a PPP and commercialized by spinoffs are powerful tools to enable a better quality of salespeople’s life in the working place. At the same time, these new technologies help shop owners increase the retention rates, conversion rates and reduce short-term loss, increasing the likelihood of B&M shops to survive in the condition of extreme competition caused by the showrooming phenomenon. Originality/value: This research proposes a model of hybrid value creation from networks in digital retail. The model indicates that PPPs create spinoffs to explore showrooming and deliver substantial hybrid value (i.e. business and social) for physical retail shops, mainly because it influences the companies’ growth, employee performance and customer satisfaction. This model expands the field of B2B marketing by identifying factors that enable spinoff creation from retail networks and proposes success factors and research propositions in retail networks. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",-1,10.1108/JBIM-01-2020-0051,"This paper examines the role of public-private partnerships (PPPs) and technology-based spinoffs in addressing showrooming in retail networks.

"Rapid urbanization not only helps the urban economy achieve rapid growth but also imposes great pressure on resources and the environment. The green and blue infrastructure (GBI) in urban areas appears to be an important measure to enhance the economic benefits of the urban environment, but related research is still limited. In this article, we combine big data and machine learning methods to investigate the economic benefits of GBI in the city of Wuhan in Hubei Province. Specifically, the daily travel routes of citizens are analyzed at two scale levels (the housing and neighborhood scales); in our analysis, we start with the structural attributes of citizens’ own houses, move on to the city street views that citizens walk through, pass by the locational amenities where citizens spend their leisure time, and arrive at open spaces located throughout the city. The above trajectory dataset includes 30 variables, which were used as the input into ordinary least squares (OLS), geographically weighted regression (GWR), and multiscale GWR (MGWR). The results show that MGWR (adj. R2 = 0.524 at the housing scale, while adj. R2 = 0.869 at the neighborhood scale) with all control variables and the GBI attribute variables have the highest goodness of fit: the closer GBI is to urban residents, the higher the economic benefits are regardless of the area; and the higher the street visible green rate is, the greater the economic benefits are. Therefore, urban areas can appropriately increase the number of well-designed small GBIs located near urban residents.

"Organisations can use artificial intelligence to make decisions about people for a variety of reasons, for instance, to select the best candidates from many job applications. However, AI systems can have discriminatory effects when used for decision-making. To illustrate, an AI system could reject applications of people with a certain ethnicity, while the organisation did not plan such ethnicity discrimination. But in Europe, an organisation runs into a problem when it wants to assess whether its AI system accidentally discriminates based on ethnicity: the organisation may not know the applicants’ ethnicity. In principle, the GDPR bans the use of certain ‘special categories of data’ (sometimes called ‘sensitive data’), which include data on ethnicity, religion, and sexual preference. The proposal for an AI Act of the European Commission includes a provision that would enable organisations to use special categories of data for auditing their AI systems. This paper asks whether the GDPR's rules on special categories of personal data hinder the prevention of AI-driven discrimination. We argue that the GDPR does prohibit such use of special category data in many circumstances. We also map out the arguments for and against creating an exception to the GDPR's ban on using special categories of personal data, to enable preventing discrimination by AI systems.

"Purpose: The purpose of the research is to explore how small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in central China achieve intelligent transformation through the use of artificial intelligence (AI). Because of unequal resource allocation, constraints on the intelligent transformation of SMEs in central China are different from those in economically and technologically well-developed coastal provinces. Hence, the authors focus on SMEs in central China to identify drivers of and barriers to intelligent transformation. Design/methodology/approach: The interview data were collected from 66 SMEs across 20 industries in central China. To verify the validity of the data collection method, the authors used two methods to control for retrospective bias: multi-level informants and enterprises' AI project application materials (Wei and Clegg, 2020). The final data were validated without conflicts. Next, the authors cautiously followed a two-step approach recommended by Venkatesh et al. (2010) and used NVivo 11.0 to analyze the collected text data. Findings: SMEs in central China are enthusiastic about intelligent transformation while facing both internal and external pressures. SMEs need to pay attention to both internal (enterprise development needs, implementation cost, human resources and top management involvement) and external factors (external market pressure, convenience of AI technology and policy support) and their different impacts on intelligent transformation. However, constrained by limited resources, SMEs in central China have been forced to take a step-by-step intelligent transformation strategy based on their actual needs with the technological flexibility method in the short term.

"Cancellations have a significant impact on the hotel and lodging industry because they directly affect income and are thus considered critical in revenue management. Specifically, cancellations made close to the time of service are the most damaging for hotels because they leave management with no time to react.

"Purpose: Technological advances regarding artificial intelligence (AI) are affecting the transport sector. Although fully autonomous delivery, or self-driving trucks, are not operating currently, various AI applications have become fixed components of cargo vehicles. Since many research approaches primarily concentrate on the technical aspects of assistance systems (ASs), the economic question of how to improve efficiency is seldom addressed. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to apply an efficiency analysis to measure the performance of truck drivers supplying retail stores. Design/methodology/approach: For this comparative study, 90 professional truck drivers in three groups are compared with (1) trucks without AS, (2) trucks with AS that cannot be turned off and (3) trucks with AS that can be turned off. First, we build a model investigating the impact of performance expectation, effort expectation, social influence and facilitating conditions on the behavioural intention to use AS. Second, we explore the impact of truck drivers' behavioural intention on actual technology use, misuse and disuse; operationalize these constructs; and merge them with our behavioural constructs to create one econometric model. Findings: The human–AI system was found to be the most efficient. Additionally, behavioural intention to use ASs did not lead to actual usage in the AI-alone observation group, but did in the human–AI group. Several in-depth analyses showed that the AI-alone group used AS at a higher level than the human–AI group, but manipulations through, for example, kickdowns or manual break operations led to conscious overriding of the cruise control system and, consequently, to higher diesel consumption, higher variable costs and lower efficiency of transport logistical operations. Research limitations/implications: Efficiency analysis with data envelopment analysis is, by design, limited by the applied input and output factors.

"Purpose: Service providers and consumers alike are increasingly adopting artificial intelligence service agents (AISA) for service. Yet, no service quality scale exists that can fully capture the key factors influencing AISA service quality. This study aims to address this shortcoming by developing a scale for measuring AISA service quality (AISAQUAL). Design/methodology/approach: Based on extant service quality research and established scale development techniques, the study constructs, refines and validates a multidimensional AISAQUAL scale through a series of pilot and validation studies. Findings: AISAQUAL contains 26 items across six dimensions: efficiency, security, availability, enjoyment, contact and anthropomorphism. The new scale demonstrates good psychometric properties and can be used to evaluate service quality across AISA, providing a means of examining the relationships between AISA service quality and satisfaction, perceived value as well as loyalty. Research limitations/implications: Future research should validate AISAQUAL with other AISA types, as they diffuse throughout the service sector. Moderating factors related to services, the customer and the AISA can be investigated to uncover the boundary conditions under which AISAQUAL is likely to influence service outcomes. Longitudinal studies can be carried out to assess how ongoing use of AISA can change service outcomes. Practical implications: Service managers can use AISAQUAL to effectively monitor, diagnose and improve services provided by AISA while enhancing their understanding of how AISA can deliver better service quality and customer loyalty outcomes.

"Reputation systems in digital workplaces increase transaction efficiency by building trust and reducing information asymmetry. These systems, however, do not yet capture the dynamic multidimensional nature of online work. By uniformly aggregating reputation scores across worker skills, they ignore skillset-specific heterogeneity (reputation attribution), and they implicitly assume that a worker's quality does not change over time (reputation staticity). Even further, reputation scores tend to be overly positive (reputation inflation), and, as a result, they often fail to differentiate workers efficiently. This work presents a new augmented intelligence reputation framework that combines human input with machine learning to provide dynamic, multidimensional, and skillset-specific worker reputation. The framework includes three components: The first component maps skillsets into a latent space of finite competency dimensions (word embedding), and, as a result, it directly addresses reputation attribution. The second builds dynamic competency-specific quality assessment models (hidden Markov models) that solve reputation staticity. The final component aggregates these competency-specific assessments to generate skillset-specific reputation scores. Application of this framework on a data set of 58,459 completed tasks from a major online labor market shows that, compared to alternative reputation systems, the proposed approach (1) yields more appropriate rankings of workers that form a closer-to-normal reputation distribution, (2) better identifies “nonperfect” workers who are more likely to underperform and are harder to predict, and (3) improves the ranking of within-opening choices and yields significantly better outcomes. Additional analysis of 77,044 restaurant reviews shows that the proposed framework successfully generalizes to alternative contexts, where assigned feedback scores are overly positive and service quality is multidimensional and dynamic.

"Research on the financial performance outcomes of open innovation has been equivocal and often relies on cross-sectional data and problematic assumptions about the role of the external context. A longitudinal perspective is crucial for gaining a better understanding of the potential of decreasing innovation utility as well as the conditions under which the costs of open innovation may counteract its benefits. Additionally, much of the research largely ignores the potential role and benefits of closed innovation. In this study, we address these issues by developing a theory related to how the benefits and costs of open innovation lead to an S-shaped relationship between the degree of openness – ranging from closed to low, medium, and high levels of open innovation – and a firm's financial performance. Furthermore, we investigate two possible contingencies in which this relationship is more pronounced: in industries with high appropriability, optimizing firms' ability to extract value from innovation and in dynamic industries, where coordinating high open innovation activities amid rapid changes is exceedingly costly. To test our hypotheses, we create a longitudinal measure for firms' degree of open innovation by using machine-learning content analyses to build an open innovation dictionary and then applying this dictionary to analyze the 10-K annual reports of >9000 publicly listed firms in the U.S. between 1994 and 2017. The results support our theorizing that the relationship between the degree of open innovation and firm financial performance is S-shaped and that industries' appropriability regimes and environmental dynamism are critical boundary conditions for this relationship. © 2023 The Author(s)",-1,10.1016/j.respol.2023.104764,"This study develops a theory on the S-shaped relationship between open innovation and financial performance, addressing the costs and benefits of open versus closed innovation.

"Business Process Management (BPM) is a central element of today organizations. Despite over the years its main focus has been the support of processes in highly controlled domains, nowadays many domains of interest to the BPM community are characterized by ever-changing requirements, unpredictable environments and increasing amounts of data that influence the execution of process instances. Under such dynamic conditions, BPM systems must increase their level of automation to provide the reactivity and flexibility necessary for process management. On the other hand, the Artificial Intelligence (AI) community has concentrated its efforts on investigating dynamic domains that involve active control of computational entities and physical devices (e.g., robots, software agents, etc.). In this context, Automated Planning, which is one of the oldest areas in AI, is conceived as a model-based approach to synthesize autonomous behaviours in automated way from a model.

"The technology of machine learning, a type of artificial intelligence, will enable organizations to analyze their use and deployment of human resources (HR) in new ways that ultimately will allow them to manage more effectively, but it will also present challenges for HR managers who are unprepared. In this paper we discuss some of the legal and ethical concerns in the HR context that accompany machine learning. Legal concerns include possible violations of both US employment discrimination laws and the provisions of the European General Data Protection Regulation, while ethical concerns for HR revolve around employee desires for privacy and justice. We assess that some data analysis activities that are legal nonetheless might not be appropriate in some cases and might be demotivating to employees, resulting in lowered performance or even counterproductive behaviors if HR mishandles the context.

"The abrupt rise in extreme weather events (floods, heat waves, droughts, etc.) due to changing climate in the last decades has increased the level of threats to various sectors (agriculture, energy, transportation, etc.) globally. The climate projections from global circulation models indicate even more intense and frequent extreme events in the future, which in turn pose more risks to socioeconomic infrastructure. The enhanced understanding of the climate-related financial risk associated with businesses has driven efforts to include critical information on probable risks associated with climate change in financial decision-making. In this study, we have presented a framework to assess the need of incorporating climate risk assessment as an integral part of business operations. We also reviewed revealed literature to understand the possible impacts of climate change on various sectors and presented key strategies to assess the climate risk associated with them. Also, a framework incorporating probable climate threats to business ecology with principles of robustness, resourcefulness, redundancy, and rapidity has been proposed to adapt and mitigate associated risks for a climate-resilient business ecosystem. The integration of Artificial Intelligence in managing risk could be a promising tool for enhancing business resilience to climate change and could be used as a tool. Robust and accurate predictions of climate and weather extremes from deep learning algorithms at a significant lead time can help in minimizing the associated risk with a business infrastructure.

"A growing number of firms are seeking to leverage emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and 3D printing, to enhance their innovation efforts. These seemingly distinct technologies are currently coalescing into an encompassing new technology called the digital twin. This technology allows innovative firms to create a digital replica of a physical entity that evolves over its life cycle. This article explores the implications of the digital twin for innovation theory and practice. First, we examine the connection between the digital twin and three related technologies (i.e., 3D printing, big data, and AI). Second, we create a typology of four categories of digital twins (i.e., monitoring, making, enhancing, and replicating) and illustrate their relevance for innovation management.

"Purpose: While artificial intelligence (AI) has shown its promise in assisting human decision, there exist barriers to adopting AI for decision-making. This study aims to identify barriers in the adoption of AI for automated organisational decision-making. AI plays a key role, not only by automating routine tasks but also by moving into the realm of automating decisions traditionally made by knowledge or skilled workers. The study, therefore, selected respondents who experienced the adoption of AI for decision-making. Design/methodology/approach: The study applied an interpretive paradigm and conducted exploratory research through qualitative interviews with 13 senior managers in South Africa from organisations involved in AI adoption to identify potential barriers to using AI in automated decision-making processes. A thematic analysis was conducted, and AI coding of transcripts was conducted and compared to the manual thematic coding of transcripts with insights into computer vs human-generated coding. A conceptual framework was created based on the findings. Findings: Barriers to AI adoption in decision-making include human social dynamics, restrictive regulations, creative work environments, lack of trust and transparency, dynamic business environments, loss of power and control, as well as ethical considerations.

"Artificial intelligence systems, which are designed with a capability to learn from the data presented to them, are used throughout society. These systems are used to screen loan applicants, make sentencing recommendations for criminal defendants, scan social media posts for disallowed content and more. Because these systems do not assign meaning to their complex learned correlation network, they can learn associations that do not equate to causality, resulting in non-optimal and indefensible decisions being made. In addition to making decisions that are sub-optimal, these systems may create legal liability for their designers and operators by learning correlations that violate anti-discrimination and other laws regarding what factors can be used in different types of decision making.

"Background and Purpose: The process of business to business (B2B) sales forecasting is a complex decision-making process. There are many approaches to support this process, but mainly it is still based on the subjective judgment of a decision-maker. The problem of B2B sales forecasting can be modeled as a classification problem. However, top performing machine learning (ML) models are black boxes and do not support transparent reasoning. The purpose of this research is to develop an organizational model using ML model coupled with general explanation methods. The goal is to support the decision-maker in the process of B2B sales forecasting. Design/Methodology/Approach: Participatory approach of action design research was used to promote acceptance of the model among users. ML model was built following CRISP-DM methodology and utilizes R software environment. Results: ML model was developed in several design cycles involving users. It was evaluated in the company for several months. Results suggest that based on the explanations of the ML model predictions the users' forecasts improved. Furthermore, when the users embrace the proposed ML model and its explanations, they change their initial beliefs, make more accurate B2B sales predictions and detect other features of the process, not included in the ML model. Conclusions: The proposed model promotes understanding, foster debate and validation of existing beliefs, and thus contributes to single and double-loop learning.

"Research Summary: Extant empirical work partitioning the variance in firm (business segment) profitability has identified industry, corporate parent, business segment, and time as key sources. However, this variance decomposition research stream has treated firms as atomistic, autonomous entities. We employ a fast-unfolding community-detection algorithm to detect firms' network memberships and use the Shapley Value method to isolate the effect of the firm's alliance network, in addition to industry, corporate parent, business segment, and year effects, on the variance in business unit performance. Our findings demonstrate that the effect of the firm's alliance network explains 11% of the variance in firm ROA among 16,381 business segments from 1979 through 1996. We also extend the time period through 2018 and find that our results broadly hold. Managerial Summary: In the search for superior firm performance, managers typically focus their attention externally on profitable industries in which to operate, as well as internally on their firms' idiosyncratic and valuable resources and capabilities. In addition to these profitability sources, our work suggests another important, but heretofore overlooked, factor in the managerial quest for competitive advantage: the value-creating potential of alliance networks. We employ a machine-learning algorithm to detect firms' network memberships. Our findings indicate that as much as 11% of the variance in firm profitability (ROA) is explained by the network of alliances of which the firm is a part.

"Wage inequality is a source of many social and economic problems, and is the target of mitigating programs both nationally and internationally. The primary step toward developing effective programs to reduce or eliminate wage inequality is identifying employees at risk of such inequalities. This study used 17,889 data points from USDOT workforce demographic information and salary data to analyze wage inequality and develop a novel framework to identify employees at risk of wage inequality. The evaluation framework includes (1) a salary prediction model, developed using artificial neural networks (ANNs), to estimate employees' salaries based on demographic information and identify underpaid employees; (2) a minority index, which is defined to score the underrepresentation of each employee regarding gender, ethnicity, and disability, based on the current status of employee diversity in the organization; and (3) a decision model, which uses the salary prediction model and minority index based on historical data to determine if new employees are at risk of wage inequality. The analysis showed that although women are underrepresented among USDOT employees, there was no significant wage inequality between men and women. Furthermore, the lowest minority index was for White men without disability, and the highest for American Indian/Alaska Native women with disability.

"Artificial intelligence (AI) can generate a greater number of recombinations of ideas than humans can, and hence AI-produced creative products could be seen as embodying more innovation and surprise which are worth higher economic value. Yet the lack of human emotionality embedded in an AI product deprives it of an essential ‘humanness’ to which people attach important cultural value.

"Retail sales has consistently faced threats by technology throughout history, with the recent advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) posing the most recent challenge. It is often said that because of new technologies, retail salespeople will disappear. In this article, we challenge this assertion by arguing that humans and technology each possess unique strengths and weaknesses, and that each works to affect the customer experience in distinct ways. Specifically, AI elevates the baseline customer experience by improving service consistency, operational efficiency, and multitasking capabilities, thereby “raising the floor” of the customer experience while human salespeople, possessing unique strengths in building customer relationships, showcasing adaptive creativity, and adhering to ethical considerations, expand the upper limits of potential customer experiences thereby “raising the ceiling” of the customer experience. We propose a synergistic future where AI and human salespeople complement each other, with human potential ultimately prevailing in delivering a superior customer experience that can be approximated, but not fully replicated by AI. Building upon this premise, we present real-world examples of retailers that embody these synergies, and we advocate and assess these instances through the lens of the “seven Cs” representing core customer experience needs: (1) curation, (2) customization, (3) community, (4) cost, (5) customer retailtainment, (6) convenience, and (7) category expertise.

"With the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), professional services firms (PSFs) need to innovate their services to adapt to AI. However, traditional ad hoc innovations driven by individual professionals have limitations in incorporating new technology outside their expertise. Although service R&D—an organizational function for centralized coordination of service innovations in strategically targeted areas—is potentially effective, studies on service R&D have still been scarce. This case study aims to fill the gap by examining how PSFs can establish and utilize service R&D to innovate services, overcoming the challenges of AI adoption. An in-depth qualitative study was conducted on the process by which the Big Four audit firms incorporated AI into their external audit service in Japan in the 2010s. The analysis shows the detailed process of how newly created service R&D organizations advanced AI adoption in the case firms. This study contributes to the literature on innovations in services and PSFs by (1) demonstrating the neglected but critical role of service R&D as an innovation enabler beyond the existing expertise of service firms, (2) constructing a three-phase model of the evolution of the service R&D function, and (3) suggesting the significance of innovation process design for the legitimation of innovations.

"Problem: The implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) is assumed to lead to increased productivity of knowledge workers. However, AI could also have negative effects on the development of professional expertise. Solution: A review of the literature on expertise development is provided, followed by examples of AI implementation in a knowledge-intensive profession, accounting. The analysis of these examples suggests that automation can result in the loss of expertise due to reduced opportunities for learning from deliberate practice and experienced colleagues, and from working on progressively more complex tasks. Implications for human resource development (HRD) include creating alternative individual development opportunities and promoting organizational cultures conducive to expertise development in human-machine interaction modes.

"Tourist destinations across the globe have been hit by the worst of the crisis that ensued the Covid-19 pandemic, and this concern is exponentially worse in developing countries. Sustainable planning of these countries to face the unheralded crises demands an approach to provide the most efficient solutions using past experiences, unique characteristics of the present crisis, and existing obstacles and challenges. The present study was conducted to develop a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model using experiences of different countries in beating the crises in the tourism industry.

"We study the effect of Airbnb’s smart-pricing algorithm on the racial disparity in the daily revenue earned by Airbnb hosts. Our empirical strategy exploits Airbnb’s introduction of the algorithm and its voluntary adoption by hosts as a quasinatural experiment. Among those who adopted the algorithm, the average nightly rate decreased by 5.7%, but average daily revenue increased by 8.6%. Before Airbnb introduced the algorithm, White hosts earned $12.16 more in daily revenue than Black hosts, controlling for observed char-acteristics of the hosts, properties, and locations. Conditional on its adoption, the revenue gap between White and Black hosts decreased by 71.3%. However, Black hosts were signif-icantly less likely than White hosts to adopt the algorithm, so at the population level, the revenue gap increased after the introduction of the algorithm. We show that the algo-rithm’s price recommendations are not affected by the host’s race—but we argue that the algorithm’s race blindness may lead to pricing that is suboptimal and more so for Black hosts than for White hosts. We also show that the algorithm’s effectiveness at mitigating the Airbnb revenue gap is limited by the low rate of algorithm adoption among Black hosts. We offer recommendations with which policy makers and Airbnb may advance smart-pricing algorithms in mitigating racial economic disparities. © 2021 INFORMS.",-1,10.1287/mksc.2021.1295,"This paper examines the impact of Airbnb's smart-pricing algorithm on racial disparities in revenue among hosts.

"Content created by employing artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, also known as synthetic content, promises to radically change the advertising and marketing landscape in the coming decades, presumably for the better. It is fundamental for advertising and marketing scholars and practitioners to have solid knowledge of how synthetic content is perceived by consumers before widespread adoption is promoted. Across three experimental studies we tested how consumers in charitable giving contexts reacted to advertising messages featuring content generated by an AI neural network. We show that potential donors responded differently to children’s faces when they knew they had been generated by AI. Study 1 established that awareness of the falsity of a face or its status as an AI-generated image has a negative impact on donation intentions. This negative impact is serially mediated by empathy and anticipatory guilt and empathy and emotion perception. Study 2 investigated several motives for employing AI-generated images and indicated that charities employing those images can benefit by making their ethical motives salient. Finally, Study 3 revealed that under extraordinary circumstances the use of AI images by charities is considered acceptable by consumers and is likely to lead to similar outcomes as the use of real images. Therefore, we recommend a cautious approach to the adoption of synthetic content. © Copyright © 2023, American Academy of Advertising.",-1,10.1080/00913367.2023.2183285,"This paper examines consumer reactions to AI-generated content in charitable advertising through three experimental studies.

"Does the mass media promote entrepreneurship? Using big data in combination with a machine learning-aided analysis, we discover a positive sentiment bias associated with entrepreneurship present in two major English-language media outlets: The New York Times and the Financial Times. Over 800,000 excerpts from 12-and 16-year periods were analyzed. Those containing the words “entrepreneur” and “founder” were found to have much more positive sentiment than did excerpts with the words “manager” and “executive.” A parallel analysis of the FANG companies (i.e., Facebook, Amazon, Net-flix, and Google) in comparison to a set of older and more established Fortune 500 companies produced similar results. While more work is needed to verify the link between media biases and career choice, we believe this media bias promotes entrepreneurship, resulting in lower (average) incomes and higher risks for those engaged in this career path. However, because entrepreneurial activity can create positive externalities in the broader economy, this bias, while financially disadvantageous for the average entrepre-neur, may be beneficial overall for society. © 2021, Academy of Management.

"Purpose: The customer contact approach to service has been at the core of service theory since the 1970s. It suggests that the potential operating efficiency of a service is inversely related to the extent of customer contact with the provider's operations and that various service design issues are dictated by the presence or absence of customer contact. The purpose of this article is to reevaluate the customer contact approach in light of advanced digital technologies. Design/methodology/approach: The authors review the origins and history of the customer contact approach and show ways it has been refined in research literature. From that they demonstrate how the refined approach can be applied to contemporary conditions. Findings: Recent advances in digital technologies have indeed required us to revise our conceptualization of customer contact. There is now a blurring between front-office and back-office operations. Emerging technologies are allowing customers to have high-contact experiences with low-contact efficiencies. Research limitations/implications: Going forward, conceptualizations of customer contact are becoming increasingly complex and requiring increasingly complex models. Armed with self-service technologies, customers are able to permeate the “buffered core” of service businesses. Artificial intelligence and anthropomorphic devices have further blurred the distinction between front-office and back-office operations. Research will need to consider new forms of technology-enabled customer contact. Practical implications: Customer contact is no longer limited to interpersonal interactions and the relationships between service providers and customers are increasingly complex. Customers may interact with automated service providers, or service providers may interact with customer technologies. New forms of customer contact may not involve humans at all, but instead involve technologies interacting with technologies. Originality/value: The customer contact approach to service was one of the original models of service design.

"Purpose: This paper aims, first, to examine artificial intelligence (AI) vs human delivery of financial advice; second, to examine the serial mediating roles of emotion and trust between AI use in the financial service industry and their impact upon marketing outcomes including word of mouth (WOM) and brand attitude; and third, to examine how political ideology moderates' consumers' reactions to AI financial service delivery. Design/methodology/approach: A review of the extant literature is conducted, yielding seven hypotheses underpinned by affect-as-information theory. The hypotheses are tested via three online scenario-based experiments (n = 801) using Process Macro. Findings: The results of the three experiments reveal consumers experience lower levels of positive emotions, specifically, affection, when financial advice is provided by AI in comparison to human employees. Secondly, across the three experiments, conservative consumers are shown to perceive somewhat similar levels of affection in financial advice provided by AI and human employees. Whereas liberal consumers perceive significantly lower levels of affection when serviced by AI in comparison to conservatives and human employee financial advice.

"Purpose: While the understanding of customer satisfaction is a key success factor for service enterprises, existing elicitation approaches suffer from several drawbacks such as high manual effort or delayed availability. However, the rise of analytical methods allows for the automatic and instant analysis of encounter data captured during service delivery in order to identify unsatisfied customers. Design/methodology/approach: Based on encounter data of 1,584 IT incidents in a real-world service use case, supervised machine learning models to predict unsatisfied customers are trained and evaluated. Findings: We show that the identification of unsatisfied customers from encounter data is well feasible: via a logistic regression approach, we predict dissatisfied customers already with decent accuracy—a substantial improvement to the current situation of “flying blind”. In addition, we are able to quantify the impacts of key service elements on customer satisfaction. Research limitations/implications: The possibility to understand the relationship between encounter data and customer satisfaction will offer ample opportunities to evaluate and expand existing service management theories.

However, there is little evidence that sheds light on how the implementation of AI systems impacts customer behavior, as well as AI systems’ effects on call center customer service performance. By leveraging the proprietary data obtained from a natural field experiment in a large telecommunication company, we examine how the introduction of a voice-based AI system affects call length, customers’ demand for human service, and customer complaints in call center customer service. We find that the implementation of the AI system temporarily increases the duration of machine service and customers’ demand for human service; however, it persistently reduces customer complaints. Furthermore, our results reveal interesting heterogeneity in the effectiveness of the voice-based AI system. For relatively simple service requests, the AI system reduces customer complaints for both experienced and inexperienced customers. However, for complex requests, customers appear to learn from the prior experience of interacting with the AI system, which leads to fewer complaints. Moreover, the AI-based system has a significantly larger effect on reducing customer complaints for older and female customers as well as for customers who have had extensive experience using the IVR system. Finally, we find that speech-recognition failures in customer-AI interactions lead to increases in customers’ demand for human service and customer complaints.

"This research is among the first to examine salespeople’s acceptance of AI (artificial intelligence) and we investigate the drivers of their AI acceptance from the perspective of the managers. In this study, we propose and empirically demonstrate that perceived ease of use, self-efficacy, perceived management support, and digitalization are positively related to salespeople’s acceptance of AI. Moreover, we show that digitalization mediates the relationship between salespeople’s prospecting/adaptive selling capabilities and their AI acceptance. The results suggest that in order to incentivize AI acceptance, managers need to build adequate digital infrastructure, cultivate organizational support to encourage AI adoption and usage, provide professional training to educate salespeople on the proper usage of AI, and reduce salespeople’s perceived risk of AI usage.

"Artificial intelligence (AI) empowers traditional firms to transform into Industry 4.0, enabling them to compete in an era of rapid technological advancements. However, AI adoption remains limited among Canadian firms. This research aims to identify the key dimensions of AI-driven digital transformation (AIDT) and develop a grounded theory that provides a rich and nuanced understanding of how the AIDT process unfolds within Canadian SMEs. The study reveals that the AIDT process is shaped by the interplay of five core dimensions: evaluating transformation context, auditing organisational readiness, piloting the AI integration, scaling the implementation, and leading the transformation. The first four dimensions follow a sequential, stage-like progression, while the fifth dimension is recurring and omnipresent, exerting a continuous impact on the other phases. AIDT is characterised as a path-dependent, slow evolutionary change spectrum that demands firms adapt by developing their sensing, seizing and reconfiguration capacities to evolve and sustain their evolutionary fitness.

"While multiple mechanisms for value creation from big data analytics (BDA) exist, their application in everyday life can create trade-offs, particularly in the context of service robotics where the dispersion of autonomous digital technologies creates potentials for data-driven efficiency gains. Attending to personal preferences in such contexts, increasingly vital for customer acceptance, may run counter to efficiency, thus constraining value creation and rendering efficiency-personalization trade-offs a key managerial challenge. For the case of autonomous vehicles (AVs), we formalize this trade-off and design a machine-learning approach to handle it by drawing on a unique dataset comprising 35,000 drives by 1,850 users. We consider the real-time dynamics and user interactions that affect the decisions of AVs and develop a model extension that allows for leveraging the properties of sharing business models to make better-informed decisions. Our study contributes to information systems (IS) AV research by providing an artifact that targets both efficiency and personalization of AV operations as well as the dynamic balance between the two. With the focus on everyday life contexts, our study points to the value of incorporating trade-offs between competing goals as well as human-centered perspectives in information systems designs for research on BDA value creation.

"The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in law has again become of great interest to lawyers and government. Legal Information Institutes (LIIs) have played a significant role in the provision of legal information via the web. The concept of ‘free access to law’ is not static, and the evolution of its principles now requires a response from providers of free access to legal information (‘a LII response’) to this renewed prominence of AI. This should include improving and expanding free access to legal advice. This paper proposes, and proposes to test, one approach that LIIs might take in the use of AI (specifically, ‘decision support’ or ‘intelligent assistance’ (IA) technologies), an approach that leverages the very large legal information assets that some LIIs have built over the past two decades. This approach focuses on how LIIs can assist providers of free legal advice (the ‘legal assistance sector’) to serve their clients. We consider the constraints that the requirement of ‘free’ imposes (on both the legal assistance sector and on LIIs), including on what types of free legal advice systems are sustainable, and what roles LIIs may realistically play in the development of such a ‘commons of free legal advice’. We suggest guidelines for development of such systems.

"High levels of economic inequality are widely viewed as a key challenge facing both advanced industrial and developing economies. Country-level studies have consistently shown a negative link between income inequality and trust in others. This is typically attributed to greater social distance within unequal societies. Do we observe similar relationships within organisations? This is an important question because employee trust is associated with important outcomes for workers and organisations. We answer it by investigating the relationship between pay inequality and employee trust in managers at the workplace level using large-scale nationally representative matched employer–employee data from Britain. The article uses innovative machine learning methods to demonstrate a curvilinear relationship between pay inequality and trust. When pay inequality is at low to moderate levels, increasing inequality is associated with increasing employee trust but when pay inequality passes a certain threshold the relationship turns negative. The relationship is mediated by employees’ perceptions of manager fairness and moderated by employee collective voice.

"The impact of companies’ adoption of robotics is increasingly interesting. This study aims to elucidate how the adoption of these technologies will affect companies and society. Companies that use these technologies expect to gain a competitive advantage, but robotization implies risks that must be managed by companies and governments. This research focuses on one of the most sensitive elements of this transformation process—the workforce. First, we analyze the characteristics of the workforce and the degree of adoption of robotics using a sample of 4,640 firms with 26 years of observation. We develop a predictive model using a supervised artificial neural network multilayer perceptron (ANN-MLP) to evaluate a company's readiness to make this transformation according to its workforce's characteristics. Second, we focus on the characterization and segmentation of the companies for which the ANN-MLP is unable to correctly predict the degree of adoption of robotics. This classification failure means that there are unidentified factors that determine why a company has a workforce composition and structure that do not correspond to its expected degree of robotization. For this analysis, we investigate the main business indicators of these companies and cluster them using an unsupervised artificial neural network, specifically the Kohonen self-organizing map. Our findings will enable companies to understand the importance of transforming to robotics at the right moment, considering factors such as the optimum structure and composition of the workforce.

In the same way as supervisors have to be trained in risk prevention to be able to perform their work, the algorithm must be programmed to weigh up the occupational risks – and when such features do not exist, steps must be taken to prevent the algorithm being used to direct workers.

"Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming healthcare operations. Nevertheless, particularly in the context of preventive care, little is known about how laypeople perceive and accept AI and change their behavior accordingly. Grounded in a solid theoretical framework of trust, this study bridges this gap by exploring individuals’ acceptance of AI-based preventive health interventions and following health behavior change, which is critical for preventive care providers’ operational and business performance. Through a randomized field experiment with 15,000 users of a mobile health app complemented by a survey, we first show that the use and disclosure of AI in preventive health interventions improve their effectiveness. However, individuals are less likely to accept and achieve the health behavior change suggested by AI than when they receive similar interventions from health experts. We also observe that the effectiveness of AI-based interventions can be improved by combining them with human expert opinions, increasing their algorithmic transparency, or emphasizing their genuine care and warmth. These results collectively suggest that, different from conventional technologies, AI's deficient affective trust, rather than comparable cognitive trust, play a decisive role in the acceptance of AI-based preventive health interventions.

"Robotic Process Automation (RPA) has quickly evolved from automating simple rule-based tasks. Nowadays, RPA is required to mimic more sophisticated human tasks, thus implying its combination with Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology, i.e., the so-called intelligent RPA.

"Artificial intelligence has been increasingly used in many managerial decision-making contexts for its superior performance. However, many managers are still averse to using AI algorithms in decision-making. The benefits of algorithms cannot be realized optimally if managers are reluctant to use them. Although there are many studies investigating the factors that make an individual averse towards algorithms, studies examining such factors in the managerial decision-making context are scarce. This study, drawing on the innovation resistance theory and the technology readiness concept, proposes a structural model depicting relationships between managers' perceived barriers and algorithm aversion. The model also incorporates the role of managers' technology readiness in influencing these relationships. To test the model, data were collected from 179 managers of 31 banks/financial institutions in Bangladesh through an online survey and were analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling. The results indicate that barriers related to value, tradition, and image are significantly associated with algorithm aversion, whereas barriers related to usage and risk have a non-significant impact.

"In an era of rapid urbanisation and increasing wealth, gentrification is an urban phenomenon impacting many cities around the world. The ability of policymakers and planners to better understand and address gentrification-induced displacement hinges upon proactive intervention strategies. It is in this context that we build a tree-based machine learning (ML) model to predict neighbourhood change in Sydney. Change, in this context, is proxied by the Socioeconomic Index for Advantage and Disadvantage, in addition to census and other ancillary predictors. Our models predict gentrification from 2011 to 2016 with a balanced accuracy of 74.7 %. Additionally, the use of an additive explanation tool enables individual prediction explanations and advanced feature contribution analysis. Using the ML model, we predict future gentrification in Sydney up to 2021. The predictions confirm that gentrification is expanding outwards from the city centre. A spill-over effect is predicted to the south, west and north-west of former gentrifying hotspots. The findings are expected to provide policymakers with a tool to better forecast where likely areas of gentrification will occur.

"Different and profound are the consequences of the further development of artificial intelligence (AI) on society. One of the manifestations of the upcoming changes is the plethora of novel ways in which companies may organize labor and capital. So far, the influence of AI on organizational structure has been mainly studied from either a technological or a broader decision-making perspective. Our paper provides a unique take on the topic, emphasizing the distinctive role of human agency and its function in the upcoming AI-driven organizational changes. Relying on the existing academic literature, we theorized a set of hypotheses concerning best fits to the AI contingency on both macro and meso-organizational levels. To test whether the hypothesized changes might encounter organizational inertia or resistance from jobholders, multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) was applied to the online survey results. Four types of current and potential jobholders were distinguished according to their explicit attitudes towards hypothesized organizational changes: Skeptics, doubtful skeptics, optimists, and doubtful optimists, the latter consisting primarily of emerging adults. Finally, we developed a model of intraorganizational response to the AI contingency based on four theoretical groups of individuals, as determined by the analysis. Our findings showed doubtful optimists to be the most important group, able to set organizational trends and positively influence skeptics and doubtful skeptics. Accordingly, promoters of AI-driven organizational changes are advised to design their communication efforts around emerging adults. As the survey was conducted amid the COVID-19 pandemic, its sociological and managerial implications are relevant to the looming reality of the postpandemic world. © 2021 by the authors.

"In its recent form, Artificial intelligence (AI) is an ensemble of technologies, which can be defined as machine-based systems for effective enterprise automation and influential decisions”. If businesses that use AI can potentially reap a competitive advantage, the optimal exploitation of such a complex ensemble of technologies remains uncertain as well as requires to have competitive access to complements such as data or new skills. Existing models of organizational use of technologies often ignore either the dynamics of competitive interactions (which can lead to pre-emption or epidemic diffusion) or the role of uncertainty, or both. In the case of AI, one type of uncertainty is particularly important: uncertainty about the technology's use cases (i.e., what to do with it). This paper proposes to apply a real options perspective to the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) adoption framework in order to uncover important patterns in the use of AI among firms. The results are threefold: (1) we find evidence of significant epidemic effects in AI use, (2) uncertainty moderates epidemic effects, and (3) the impact of uncertainty depends on its source: an uncertain AI use case reduces herd behaviours while uncertainty about use case returns still favours them. These results highlight the importance of exploration and collective learning in the diffusion of emerging and complex technologies, especially when companies struggle to identify the most profitable use cases for the technology. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",-1,10.1016/j.technovation.2023.102846,This paper examines the dynamics of AI adoption in organizations through a real options perspective within the Technology-Organization-Environment framework.

"Customer misbehavior is a serious and pervasive problem in firm-sponsored social media, yet prior studies provide limited insight into how firms should detect and manage it. To address this gap, we first develop a data science approach to detect customer misbehavior on social media and then devise intervention strategies to deter it. Specifically, we build on natural language processing and deep learning techniques to automatically detect customer misbehavior by mining customers’ social media activities in collaboration with a leading apparel firm. The results show that our algorithmic solution achieves superior performance, improving detection by 7%–9% compared with traditional methods. We then implement two types of intervention policies based on the focus theory of normative conduct that advocates the use of injunctive norms (i.e., a punishment policy) and descriptive norms (i.e., a common identity policy) to restrain customer misbehavior. We conduct field experiments with the firm to validate these policies. The experimental results indicate that punishment considerably reduces customer misbehavior in the short term, but this effect decays over time, whereas common identity has a smaller but more persistent effect on misbehavior reduction. In addition, punishing dysfunctional customers decreases their purchase frequency, whereas imposing a common identity increases it. Interestingly, our results show that combining the two policies effectively alleviates the detrimental effect of punishment, especially in the long run. We examine the heterogeneous treatment effect on novice and experienced customers. Finally, a follow-up field experiment reveals that the disclosure of the use of an artificial intelligence detector improves the effectiveness of the intervention strategies, and this effect is more pronounced for the punishment and combination strategies. © 2021 INFORMS",-1,10.1287/isre.2021.1035,"This paper develops a data science approach using natural language processing and deep learning to detect customer misbehavior on social media.

"Increasingly, on-demand nature of customer interactions put pressure on companies to build real-time campaign management systems. Instead of having managers to decide on the campaign rules, such as, when, how and whom to offer, creating intelligent campaign management systems that can automate such decisions is essential. In addition, regulations or company policies usually restrict the number of accesses to the customers. Efficient learning of customer behaviour through dynamic campaign participation observations becomes a crucial feature that may ultimately define customer satisfaction and retention. This paper builds on the recent successes of deep learning techniques and proposes a classification model to predict customer responses for campaigns. Classic deep neural networks are good at learning hidden relations within data (i.e., patterns) but with limited capability for memorization. One solution to increase memorization is to use manually craft features, as in Wide & Deep networks, which are originally proposed for Google Play App. recommendations. We advocate using decision trees as an easier way of mining high-level relationships for enhancing Wide & Deep networks. Such an approach has the added benefit of beating manually created rules, which, most of the time, use incomplete data and have biases.

The evaluation of the method consisted of an embedded single-case study, where participants from two countries simulated the realities of negotiation between companies. For comparison, traditional negotiation via e-mail was also conducted. The evaluation confirms that the proposed E-NeGotiAtion method quickly achieves solution(s), approaching the optimal solution on which both sides can decide, and also very importantly, confirms that the method facilitates negotiation with the partner and creates a trusted result. The evaluation demonstrates that the proposed method is economically efficient for parties of the dispute compared to negotiation via e-mail. For a more complicated task with five or more products, the E-NeGotiAtion method is significantly more suitable than negotiation via e-mail for achieving a resolution that favors one side or the other as little as possible. In conclusion, it can be said that the proposed method fulfills the definition of the dual-task of ODR—it resolves disputes and builds confidence. © 2021 by the authors.

"With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI), ethical issues surrounding AI have attracted increasing attention. In particular, autonomous vehicles may face moral dilemmas in accident scenarios, such as staying the course resulting in hurting pedestrians or swerving leading to hurting passengers. To investigate such ethical dilemmas, recent studies have adopted preference aggregation, in which each voter expresses her/his preferences over decisions for the possible ethical dilemma scenarios, and a centralized system aggregates these preferences to obtain the winning decision. Although a useful methodology for building ethical AI systems, such an approach can potentially violate the privacy of voters since moral preferences are sensitive information and their disclosure can be exploited by malicious parties resulting in negative consequences. In this paper, we report a first-of-its-kind privacy-preserving crowd-guided AI decision-making approach in ethical dilemmas. We adopt the formal and popular notion of differential privacy to quantify privacy, and consider four granularities of privacy protection by taking voter-/record-level privacy protection and centralized/distributed perturbation into account, resulting in four approaches VLCP, RLCP, VLDP, and RLDP, respectively. Moreover, we propose different algorithms to achieve these privacy protection granularities, while retaining the accuracy of the learned moral preference model. Specifically, VLCP and RLCP are implemented with the data aggregator setting a universal privacy parameter and perturbing the averaged moral preference to protect the privacy of voters' data. VLDP and RLDP are implemented in such a way that each voter perturbs her/his local moral preference with a personalized privacy parameter. Extensive experiments based on both synthetic data and real-world data of voters' moral decisions demonstrate that the proposed approaches achieve high accuracy of preference aggregation while protecting individual voter's privacy. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",-1,10.1145/3357384.3357954,"This paper addresses ethical dilemmas in AI decision-making, particularly in autonomous vehicles, by proposing a privacy-preserving approach to preference aggregation.

"With the proliferation of information technology and artificial intelligence in society, human users have started to engage in social interactions with computer agents. In this study, we conducted a laboratory experiment in which neurophysiological measurements were used to investigate the effect of computer agents on the affective processes and behavior of human negotiators. Participants engaged in alternating-offer bargaining over the partition of a pie with either human or computer counterparts and under different levels of urgency to reach an agreement. Overall, our data show that the subjects claimed significantly higher proportions for themselves when they made opening offers to computer agents than when bargaining with human counterparts, regardless of the degree of urgency in the negotiation. However, when the subjects responded to computer-issued offers the picture was more complex. Whereas under high-level urgency, the subjects were more likely to accept offers made by computer agents than by human counterparts, we observed the opposite effect for low-level urgency, where they were less likely to accept the offers of computer agents. In combination, these behavioral patterns lead to the use of computer agents yielding an increase in economic efficiency. Further, the subjects exhibited less emotionally charged behavior when facing computer agents than when facing human counterparts, as the intensity of affective processes was lower and the relationship between arousal and offer acceptance was observable only when the counterparts were human. The results of our study shed light on the potential benefits and intricacies of employing computer agents in electronic negotiations. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.",-1,10.1007/s10726-018-9579-5,"This study examines the effects of computer agents on human negotiators' behavior and affective processes through a laboratory experiment.

"Applying artificial intelligence (AI), especially natural language processing (NLP), to harness large amounts of information from patent databases, online communities, social media, or crowdsourcing platforms is becoming increasingly popular to help organizations find promising solutions. In the era of non-human innovation intermediaries, we should begin to view NLP not only as a useful technology applied in different innovation practices but also as an intermediary orchestrating valuable information. Previous research has not taken this perspective, and knowledge about its intermediation activities and functions is limited. This study reviews 167 academic articles to better understand how NLP approaches can enrich intermediation in early-stage innovation search. It identifies 18 distinctive innovation practices taking over activities like forecasting trends, illustrating technology and idea landscapes, filtering out distinctive contributions, recombining domain-specific and analogous knowledge, or matching problems with solutions. While certain NLP capabilities complement each other, the analysis shows that the choice of the most appropriate approach depends on the characteristics of the innovation practice.

"Customer care is important for its role in relationship building. This role has traditionally been performed by human customer agents; however, the emergence of interactive generative AI (GenAI) shows potential for using AI for customer care in emotionally charged interactions. Bridging practice and the academic literatures in marketing and computer science, this article develops an AI-enabled customer care journey, from accurate emotion recognition to empathetic response, emotional management support, and, finally, the establishment of an emotional connection. Marketing requirements for each of the stages are derived from in-depth interviews with top managers and a survey of chief marketing officers. By juxtaposing these requirements against the current feeling capabilities of GenAI, the authors highlight the technological challenges engineers must tackle. The article concludes with a set of marketing tenets for implementing and researching the caring machine.

"Over the last decade, many organizations worldwide have been assimilating Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies to increase their productivity and attain a competitive advantage. As with any technology, intelligence systems come with potential downsides. Despite the efforts to mitigate any negative consequences of AI, businesses and employees continue to confront the dilemmas of adopting AI, so it is essential to explore in detail the rising concerns around such technologies. In this paper, we used a single case study to investigate the dark aspects of AI in a Norwegian energy trading firm. We gathered data through semi-structured interviews and secondary data. Specifically, we interviewed AI managers, traders and developers who have worked on deploying and using AI tools over the last three years. Our aim is to identify the dark side of AI use in trading, how AI trading bots affect the relationship between traders and AI developers and how the firm adjusts to this new reality. The findings indicate that negative or unintended consequences of AI can be grouped into three clusters related to (1) the nature of the work; (2) conflicts and effects; and (3) responsibility.

"Purpose: This paper aims to identify the disproportionate impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on labor markets. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conduct a large-scale survey on 16,000 firms from 82 industries in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, and analyze the data set by using different machine-learning methods. Findings: First, job loss and reduction in state-owned enterprises have been significantly larger than in other types of organizations. Second, employees of foreign direct investment enterprises suffer a significantly lower labor income than those of other groups. Third, the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the labor market are heterogeneous across industries and geographies. Finally, firms with high revenue in 2019 are more likely to adopt preventive measures, including the reduction of labor forces. The authors also find a significant correlation between firms' revenue and labor reduction as traditional econometrics and machine-learning techniques suggest. Originality/value: This study has two main policy implications. First, although government support through taxes has been provided, the authors highlight evidence that there may be some additional benefit from targeting firms that have characteristics associated with layoffs or other negative labor responses. Second, the authors provide information that shows which firm characteristics are associated with particular labor market responses such as layoffs, which may help target stimulus packages. Although the COVID-19 pandemic affects most industries and occupations, heterogeneous firm responses suggest that there could be several varieties of targeted policies-targeting firms that are likely to reduce labor forces or firms likely to face reduced revenue. In this paper, the authors outline several industries and firm characteristics which appear to more directly be reducing employee counts or having negative labor responses which may lead to more cost–effect stimulus. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",-1,10.1108/IJOEM-02-2021-0292,"This paper examines the disproportionate impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on labor markets through a large-scale survey of firms in Vietnam, utilizing machine learning methods for data analysis.

"Purpose: Artificial intelligence (AI) is a rapidly growing frontier. One promising area for AI is its potential to assist sales managers in providing salesperson feedback. Despite this promise, little work has been done within the business-to-business (B2B) sales domain to investigate the potential impact of AI feedback on critical sales outcomes. The purpose of this research is to explore these issues and respond to calls in the literature to determine how AI can enhance salesperson adaptability and performance. Design/methodology/approach: Survey data from a sample of 246 B2B salespeople was used to test the conceptual model and research hypotheses. The data were analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Findings: The findings provide broad support for the model. An AI-feedback rich environment and salesperson feedback orientation predicted perceived accuracy of AI feedback which, in turn, strengthened intentions to use AI feedback. These favorable reactions to AI feedback positively related to adaptive selling behaviors, and adaptive selling behaviors mediated the relationships between intentions to use AI feedback and organizational commitment, as well as sales performance.

"This paper examines the dependence between Artificial Intelligence (AI) and eight energy-focused sectors (including renewable energy and coal) across different market conditions and investment horizons. This paper adopts both linear and non-linear models such as quantile regressions and quantile cross-spectral coherency models. Evidence from the linear model suggests that the performance of energy-focused corporations, especially those in the renewable energy sector depends strongly on the performance of AI. Results from the non-linear model indicate that dependence varies across both energy sectors, market conditions as well as investment horizons. By considering both negative and positive shocks on AI, we demonstrate that the dependence of energy corporations on AI also varies according to the direction of shocks on AI. Interestingly, negative and positive shocks on AI impact differently on the performance of energy corporations across different sectors and market conditions. Besides, we found that the dependence became stronger during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.

"This study uses machine learning techniques to model patent claim clarity and analyze how clarity relates to important patent policy objectives. Specifically, machine learning models are trained on a dataset of over 600,000 U.S. patent applications that were (or were not) rejected for indefiniteness, a proxy for claim clarity, using features based on the linguistic attributes of each application. The model is then applied to over 2 million issued patents and their corresponding applications, deriving estimates of the clarity of each patent's claim set at application and issuance. First, the properties of claim clarity and its relationship with the patent examination process are studied. Wordiness and repetitiveness corresponds to reduced clarity, whereas more descriptiveness whereas clearer claims tend to be more descriptive. Clarity also changes during patent examination, indicating that patent office policies may affect claim clarity. Next, the relationship between claim clarity and cumulative innovation is studied. Clear patents are found to receive more citations by applicants of unrelated future patents, a key indicator of cumulative innovation. However, unclear patents tend to receive more examiner citations, particularly in later years, and the technological relevance of examiner citations also tends to decline over time. This raises important questions about the role of late-stage examiner citations in the patent examination process, which are framed for future research. Finally, this study evaluates the impact of the U.S. Supreme Court's Nautilus v. Biosig decision, which sought to improve patent claim clarity.

The application of AI- and Big Data-powered tools promises cost reduction, the creation of innovative products, and the potential to offer more efficient and tailored services to consumers. However, these new opportunities are mirrored by new legal and regulatory challenges. This article discusses challenges facing Australian data protection law, focusing on (potential) collection of consumers' data by insurers from non-traditional sources. In particular, we examine situations in which consumers may not be aware that the data collected could end up being used to price insurance. In our analysis, we discuss two useful examples of such non-traditional data sources: customer loyalty schemes and social media. These may give rise to several concerning data practices, including a significant increase in the collection of consumers' data by insurers. We argue that datafication of insurer processes may fuel excessive data collection in the context of insurance contracts, generating a substantial risk of harm to consumers, especially in terms of discrimination, exclusion, and unaffordability of insurance.

"With artificial intelligence (AI) increasingly involved in the creation of organizational and commercial artifacts, human evaluators’ role as creativity gatekeepers of AI-produced artifacts will become critical for innovation processes. However, when humans evaluate creativity, their judgment is clouded by biases triggered by the characteristics of the creator. Drawing from folk psychology and algorithm aversion research, we examine whether the identity of the producer of a given artifact as artificial intelligence (AI) or human is a source of bias affecting people’s creativity evaluation of such artifact and what drives this effect. With four experimental studies (N = 2039), of which two were pre-registered, using different experimental designs and evaluation targets, we found that people sometimes—but not always—ascribe lower creativity to a product when they are told that the producer is an AI rather than a human. In addition, we found that people consistently perceive generative AI to exert less effort than humans in the creation of a given artifact, which drives the lower creativity ratings ascribed to generative AI producers. We discuss the implication of these findings for organizational creativity and innovation in the context of human-AI interaction. © The Author(s) 2023.",-1,10.1007/s10869-023-09910-x,"This paper examines biases in human evaluations of creativity based on whether an artifact is produced by AI or humans.

"The rapid adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies by many organizations has recently raised concerns that AI may eventually replace humans in certain tasks. In fact, when used in collaboration, machines can significantly enhance the complementary strengths of humans. Indeed, because of their immense computing power, machines can perform specific tasks with incredible accuracy. In contrast, human decision makers (DMs) are flexible and adaptive but constrained by their limited cognitive capacity. This paper investigates how machine-based predictions may affect the decision process and outcomes of a human DM. We study the impact of these predictions on decision accuracy, the propensity and nature of decision errors, and the DM’s cognitive efforts. To account for both flexibility and limited cognitive capacity, we model the human decision-making process in a rational inattention framework. In this setup, the machine provides the DM with accurate but sometimes incomplete information at no cognitive cost. We fully characterize the impact of machine input on the human decision process in this framework. We show that machine input always improves the overall accuracy of human decisions but may nonetheless increase the propensity of certain types of errors (such as false positives). The machine can also induce the human to exert more cognitive efforts, although its input is highly accurate. Interestingly, this happens when the DM is most cognitively constrained, for instance, because of time pressure or multitasking. Synthesizing these results, we pinpoint the decision environments in which human-machine collaboration is likely to be most beneficial. © 2024 INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences.

"Purpose: The introduction of artificial intelligence (AI) technology has had a substantial influence on the retail industry. However, AI adoption entails considerable responsibilities and risks for senior managers. In this study, the authors developed an evaluation and selection mechanism for successful AI technology adoption in the retail industry. The multifaceted measurement and identification of critical factors (CFs) can enable retailers to adopt AI technology effectively and maintain a sustainable competitive advantage. Design/methodology/approach: The evaluation and adoption of organisational AI technology involve multifaceted decision-making for management. Therefore, the authors used the analytic network process to develop an AI evaluation framework for calculating the weight and importance of each consideration. An expert questionnaire survey was distributed to senior retail managers and 17 valid responses were obtained. Finally, the Vlse Kriterijumska Optimizacija Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) method was used to identify CFs for AI adoption. Findings: The results revealed five CFs for AI adoption in the retail industry. The findings indicated that after AI adoption, top retail management is most concerned with factors pertaining to business performance and minor concerned about the internal system's functional efficiency. Retailers pay more attention to technology and organisation context, which are matters under the retailers' control, than to external uncontrollable environmental factors. Originality/value: The authors developed an evaluation framework and identified CFs for AI technology adoption in the retail industry.

"Purpose: Artificial intelligence (AI) has a large number of applications at the industry and user levels. However, AI's uniqueness neglect is becoming an obstacle in the further application of AI. Based on the theory of innovation resistance, this paper aims to explore the effect of AI's uniqueness neglect on consumer resistance to AI. Design/methodology/approach: The authors tested four hypothesis across four studies by conducting lab experiments. Study 1 used a questionnaire to verify the hypothesis that AI's uniqueness neglect leads to consumer resistance to AI; Studies 2 focused on the role of human–AI interaction trust as an underlying driver of resistance to medical AI. Study 3–4 provided process evidence by way of a measured moderator, testing whether participants with a greater sense of non-verbal human–AI communication are more reluctant to have consumer resistance to AI. Findings: The authors found that AI's uniqueness neglect increased users' resistance to AI. This occurs because the uniqueness neglect of AI hinders the formation of interaction trust between users and AI. The study also found that increasing the gaze behavior of AI and increasing the physical distance in the interaction can alleviate the effect of AI's uniqueness neglect on consumer resistance to AI.

"There are several legal and ethical problems associated with the far-reaching integration of man with Artificial Intelligence (AI) within the framework of algorithmic management. One of these problems is the question of the legal subjectivity of the parties to a contractual obligation within the framework of crowdworking, which includes the service provider, the Internet platform with AI, and the applicant's client. Crowdworking is an excellent example of a laboratory of interdependence and collaboration between humans and artificial intelligence as part of the algorithmic management process. Referring to the example of crowdworking platforms, we should ask whether, in the face of the rapid development of AI and algorithmic management, AI can be an employer equipped with electronic personhood? What characteristics does a work environment in which AI and algorithmic governance mechanisms play a dominant role? What kind of ethical implications are associated with the practical application of the concept of electronic subjectivity of AI in employment relations? This paper analyses the legal and ethical implications of electronic AI subjectivity in the work environment. The legal construction of electronic personhood is examined. The legal entity that uses AI, which manages the work process through algorithmic subordination, bears the risks resulting from such use (economic, personal, technical, and social) and full material responsibility (individual liability regime with the application of the presumption of guilt rule) in case of damage to an employee. Liability provisions can be complemented by a mandatory insurance scheme for AI users and a compensation fund that can offer support when none of the insurance policies covers the risk. A compensation fund can be paid for by the manufacturer, owner, user, or trainer of the AI and can compensate all those who suffer damage as a result of its operations. This is the direction proposed by the European Parliament, which has progressively called for robots to be given an electronic personality. The personalistic concept of work excludes the possibility of AI becoming a legal entity. Alongside legal arguments, ethical questions are of fundamental importance.

"As an industry, tourism tends to be extremely responsive and vulnerable to political instabilities. Recently, a political conflict occurred in Spain, a leader in international tourism. In October 2017, the regional parliament of Catalonia asserted its independence from Spain, engendering a negative impact on the tourism sector of Catalonia. The main goal of our study is to assess the economic impact of the Catalan separatist challenge on the region’s tourism sector during the last quarter of 2017. To this end, we conducted a counterfactual analysis, based on forecasts generated by a seasonal autoregressive moving average model and an artificial neural network. The forecasts allowed us to calculate the projected number of international and domestic tourist visitors that would have travelled to Catalonia, had the separatist challenge not occurred. According to our results, the Catalan tourist sector effectively forfeited close to €200 million in revenue from the international tourism market, and around €27 million in revenue from the domestic market.

"As artificial intelligence (AI) solutions are being rapidly deployed, they increasingly compete with human labor. This study examines designers' strategies in response to the threat from the introduction of an AI system for simple logo designs in a crowdsourcing design platform. We study designers who were active both before and after the introduction of the AI system to understand their responses to the threat from AI. Our study is informed by the theories of threat, specifically the protection motivation theory that posits that individuals will respond to threats based on their capabilities. We find that, although some designers who had primarily participated in contests for lower-tier, simple logo designs leave the platform, others continue to participate in these contests. Interestingly, designers who have higher capabilities, evidenced by their prior participation in more-complex higher-tier logo-design contests and contests in other nonlogo categories, move away from the primary locus of threat in the lower-tier and switch to the more-complex contests after the introduction of the AI system. More interestingly, we find that successful designers respond differently from unsuccessful designers on the platform. Although unsuccessful designers increase participation across multiple contests, they do not change the quality (emotional content and complexity) of their design submissions after the AI launch.

"Purpose: Artificial intelligence (AI) has started to receive attention in the field of digital entrepreneurship. However, few studies propose AI-based models aimed at assisting entrepreneurs in their day-to-day operations. In addition, extant models from the product design literature, while technically promising, fail to propose methods suitable for opportunity development with high level of uncertainty. This study develops and tests a predictive model that provides entrepreneurs with a digital infrastructure for automated testing. Such an approach aims at harnessing AI-based predictive technologies while keeping the ability to respond to the unexpected. Design/methodology/approach: Based on effectuation theory, this study identifies an AI-based, predictive phase in the “build-measure-learn” loop of Lean startup. The predictive component, based on recommendation algorithm techniques, is integrated into a framework that considers both prediction (causal) and controlled (effectual) logics of action. The performance of the so-called active learning build-measure-predict-learn algorithm is evaluated on a data set collected from a case study. Findings: The results show that the algorithm can predict the desirability level of newly implemented product design decisions (PDDs) in the context of a digital product. The main advantages, in addition to the prediction performance, are the ability to detect cases where predictions are likely to be less precise and an easy-to-assess indicator for product design desirability. The model is found to deal with uncertainty in a threefold way: epistemological expansion through accelerated data gathering, ontological reduction of uncertainty by revealing prior “unknown unknowns” and methodological scaffolding, as the framework accommodates both predictive (causal) and controlled (effectual) practices. Originality/value: Research about using AI in entrepreneurship is still in a nascent stage. This paper can serve as a starting point for new research on predictive techniques and AI-based infrastructures aiming to support digital entrepreneurs in their day-to-day operations. This work can also encourage theoretical developments, building on effectuation and causation, to better understand Lean startup practices, especially when supported by digital infrastructures accelerating the entrepreneurial process. © 2022, Santo Raneri, Fabian Lecron, Julie Hermans and François Fouss.",-1,10.1108/IJEBR-07-2021-0566,"This paper develops and tests an AI-based predictive model to assist entrepreneurs in digital product design, integrating predictive and effectual logics.

"Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are receiving attention in many countries, including Thailand. However, implementing an intelligent transport system has many challenges, such as safety and reliability and the lack of policy supporting such technology use, leading to hazards for passengers and pedestrians. Hence, factors affecting the adoption of autonomous vehicles require better understanding. This research proposes and employs an extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) by integrating ethical standards, legal concerns, and trust to predict the intended use of autonomous vehicles by Thai citizens. A total of 318 questionnaires were collected from online panel respondents. Research hypotheses were tested using a structural equation modelling approach. The study results suggest that ethical standards have a significant positive effect on the intention to use the technology. Meanwhile, the intention was negatively affected by perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and legal concerns. On the other hand, the results indicate that perceived ease of use directly affected trust, leading to AV adoption. However, other factors influenced trust insignificantly. This study demonstrates the vital role of trust in AV adoption. The study also suggests ideas for further study and discusses the implications for the government and autonomous vehicle companies. The article aims to forecast a success factor that the Thai government should use to consider the policy for autonomous vehicle adoption in Thailand. This paper relies on the technology acceptance model to assess and forecast autonomous vehicle adoption. The theoretical model also includes ethical issues, legal concerns and trust in technology.

"As artificial intelligence (AI) applications proliferate, their creators seemingly anticipate that users will make similar trade-offs between costs and benefits across various commercial and public applications, due to the technological similarity of the provided solutions. With a multimethod investigation, this study reveals instead that users develop idiosyncratic evaluations of benefits and costs depending on the context of AI implementation. In particular, the tensions that drive AI adoption depend on perceived personal costs and choice autonomy relative to the perceived (personal vs. societal) benefits. The tension between being served rather than exploited is lowest for public AI directed at infrastructure (cf. commercial AI), due to lower perceived costs. Surveillance AI evaluations are driven by fears beyond mere privacy breaches, which overcome the societal and safety benefits.

"Business Process Management (BPM) aims to improve organizational activities and their outcomes by managing the underlying processes. To achieve this, it is often necessary to consider information from various sources, including unstructured textual documents. Therefore, researchers have developed several BPM-specific solutions that extract information from textual documents using Natural Language Processing techniques. These solutions are specific to their respective tasks and cannot accomplish multiple process-related problems as a general-purpose instrument. However, in light of the recent emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) with remarkable reasoning capabilities, such a general-purpose instrument with multiple applications now appears attainable. In this paper, we illustrate how LLMs can accomplish text-related BPM tasks by applying a specific LLM to three exemplary tasks: mining imperative process models from textual descriptions, mining declarative process models from textual descriptions, and assessing the suitability of process tasks from textual descriptions for robotic process automation. We show that, without extensive configuration or prompt engineering, LLMs perform comparably to or better than existing solutions and discuss implications for future BPM research as well as practical usage. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",-1,10.1007/978-3-031-50974-2_34,"This paper demonstrates the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Business Process Management (BPM) tasks, showcasing their ability to handle multiple text-related BPM challenges.

"In traditional industries, such as the automotive industry, incumbents must draw on big data and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies by designing AI-embedded systems integrated into their end products. While such systems are predominantly presented as paving the way for new knowledge explorative approaches, traditional industry incumbents may face challenges integrating such disruptive technology in their optimized new product development processes. Hence, this study investigates the extent to which incumbents innovate through the design of AI-embedded systems—either via explorative or exploitative strategies—by focusing on the case of the automotive industry. It employed a sequential explanatory mixed-method design and a knowledge search theoretical framework. A quantitative analysis of 46,145 patents from the top 19 traditional companies to identify AI and non-AI patents revealed that firms primarily rely on knowledge exploitation when designing and integrating AI-embedded systems, surprisingly fostering innovativeness. Complementary qualitative insights reveal that big data and AI technologies are integrated into the industrialization phase of new vehicle development, per a creative problem-solving patch.

"Emotion artificial intelligence, the algorithm that recognizes and interprets various human emotions beyond valence (positive and negative polarity), is still in its infancy but has attracted attention from industry and academia. Based on discrete emotion theory and statistical language modeling, this work proposes an algorithm to enable automatic domain-adaptive emotion lexicon construction and multidimensional emotion detection in texts. Using a large-scale dataset of China’s movie market from 2012 to 2018, we constructed and validated a domain-specific emotion lexicon and demonstrated the predictive power of eight discrete emotions (i.e., surprise, joy, anticipation, love, anxiety, sadness, anger, and disgust) in online reviews on box office sales. We found that representing overall emotions through discrete emotions yields higher prediction accuracy than valence or latent emotion variables generated by topic modeling. To understand the source of the predictive power from a theoretical perspective and to test the cross-culture generalizability of our prediction study, we further conducted an experiment in the U.S. movie market based on theories on emotion, judgment, and decision-making. We found that discrete emotions, mediated by perceived processing fluency, significantly affect the perceived review helpfulness, which further influences purchase intention.

"Based on consumers' preferences, AI (artificial intelligence) recommendation automatically filters information, which provokes scholars' debate. Supporters believe that by analyzing the consumers' preferences, AI recommendation enables consumers to choose products more quickly and at a lower cost. Critics deem that consumers are more easily trapped in information cocoons because of the use of AI recommendations. This reduces the possibility of consumers contacting a variety of commodities, thus lowering the consumer decision quality. Based on experiments, this paper discusses the moderating role of AI recommendation on the relationship between consumers' preferences and information cocoons. Moreover, it examines the relationship between information cocoons and consumer decision quality. The findings are: AI recommendation strengthens consumers' preferences; consumers' preferences are positively correlated with information cocoons and further lead to the decline of consumers’ decision quality.

"Can AI-generated voices be designed to improve product and brand perceptions? Akin to human voices that evoke mental images in a listener even without visual cues, artificially generated voices can be intentionally designed to elicit envisioned mental representations.

"Small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are constrained by scarce resources, yet they are under strong pressure to maintain a competitive position in global markets, especially during crises such as the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic. In this context, electronic commerce (hereafter e-commerce) platforms combining artificial intelligence (AI) and agile methods have been thriving. On the one hand, AI is a better way to process the data essential to platform customization and optimization. On the other hand, agile adoption ensures iterative software delivery as well as improved management practices that reduce uncertainty and allow SMEs to adapt more easily to new market requirements. A limited number of studies have covered all three topics, especially in relation to these companies. This research focused on creating an innovative model to identify determinants that favor or inhibit SME development of e-commerce, AI, and agile method projects. The model was developed using cognitive mapping - based on strategic options development and analysis - and decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory technique.

"Interest in the economic effects of walkable environments is growing as the multidimensional benefits of walkability can be capitalized into surrounding property values. Commercial properties may be more sensitive to the economic effects of walkability compared to other types of properties due to their distinct attributes, but not many studies have investigated the relationships between walkable environments and commercial property values. Additionally, previous studies identified walkable environments on a neighborhood-scale, not at a meso- and micro-scale. This study fills these gaps by examining the effects of multifaceted walkable environments on commercial property values in Seoul, Korea. Based on sales transaction data between 2017 and 2019, we employed the hedonic price model to clarify the relationships between walkable environments and commercial property values. This study estimated walkable environments using semantic segmentation based on Google Street View images. Furthermore, we accounted for commercial submarkets to identify how the impacts of walkability vary across areas stratified by living population density. The results show that various walkable environments positively affect nearby commercial property values. Additionally, these effects vary across commercial submarkets' heterogeneity. Our findings provide a variety of suggestions for encouraging the creation of walkable environments and increasing the economic benefits of commercial properties. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",-1,10.1016/j.cities.2023.104628,"This study examines the economic effects of walkable environments on commercial property values in Seoul, using sales transaction data and a hedonic price model.

"Large Language Models (LLMs) are capable of answering questions in natural language for various purposes. With recent advancements (such as GPT-4), LLMs perform at a level comparable to humans for many proficient tasks. The analysis of business processes could benefit from a natural process querying language and using the domain knowledge on which LLMs have been trained. However, it is impossible to provide a complete database or event log as an input prompt due to size constraints. In this paper, we apply LLMs in the context of process mining by i) abstracting the information of standard process mining artifacts and ii) describing the prompting strategies. We implement the proposed abstraction techniques into pm4py, an open-source process mining library. We present a case study using available event logs.

"Crowdsourcing generates up to thousands of ideas per contest. The selection of best ideas is costly because of the limited number, objectivity, and attention of experts. Using a data set of 21 crowdsourcing contests that include 4,191 ideas, we test how artificial intelligence can assist experts in screening ideas. The authors have three major findings. First, whereas even the best previously published theory-based models cannot mimic human experts in choosing the best ideas, a simple model using the least average shrinkage and selection operator can efficiently screen out ideas considered bad by experts. In an additional 22nd hold-out contest with internal and external experts, the simple model does better than external experts in predicting the ideas selected by internal experts. Second, the authors develop an idea screening efficiency curve that trades off the false negative rate against the total ideas screened. Managers can choose the desired point on this curve given their loss function. The best model specification can screen out 44% of ideas, sacrificing only 14% of good ideas. Alternatively, for those unwilling to lose any winners, a novel two-step approach screens out 21% of ideas without sacrificing a single first place winner. Third, a new predictor, word atypicality, is simple and efficient in screening. Theoretically, this predictor screens out atypical ideas and keeps inclusive and rich ideas. © 2023 INFORMS.",-1,10.1287/mksc.2023.1434,"This paper examines how AI can assist experts in screening ideas from crowdsourcing contests, analyzing a dataset of 4,191 ideas.

"Purpose: This article revisits some theories and concepts of public administration, including those related to public value, transaction costs and social equity, to analyze the advantages and disadvantages of using artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in public service delivery. The author seeks to mobilize theory to guide AI-era public management practitioners and researchers. Design/methodology/approach: The author uses an existing task classification model to mobilize and juxtapose public management theories against artificial intelligence potential impacts in public service delivery. Theories of social equity and transaction costs as well as some concepts such as red tape, efficiency and economy are used to argue that the discipline of public administration provides a foundation to ensure algorithms are used in a way that improves service delivery. Findings: After presenting literature on the challenges and promises of using AI in public service, the study shows that while the adoption of algorithms in public service has benefits, some serious challenges still exist when looked at under the lenses of theory. Additionally, the author mobilizes the public administration concepts of agenda setting and coproduction and finds that designing AI-enabled public services should be centered on citizens who are not mere customers. As an implication for public management practice, this study shows that bringing citizens to the forefront of designing and implementing AI-delivered services is key to reducing the reproduction of social biases.

"With the confluence of rapidly continuing economic development and increasing greenhouse gas emissions, the frequency and severity of natural disasters caused by global warming have increased in recent years. The international Financial Stability Board established the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) to provide recommendations for collecting and disclosing climate-related information that is helpful for decision-making such that investors, decision-makers and supervision units can understand and more accurately assess climate-related risks as well as opportunities. However, the TCFD recommendations only provide a general framework of risks and opportunities from which companies cannot derive specific disaster-related data for regional climate disclosures. For stakeholders in different continents and regions, there is a need to develop a disaster data-driven model that can precisely disclose regional risks.

"Crowdsourcing holds great potential: macro-task crowdsourcing can, for example, contribute to work addressing climate change. Macro-task crowdsourcing aims to use the wisdom of a crowd to tackle non-trivial tasks such as wicked problems. However, macro-task crowdsourcing is labor-intensive and complex to facilitate, which limits its efficiency, effectiveness, and use. Technological advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) might overcome these limits by supporting the facilitation of crowdsourcing. However, AI’s potential for macro-task crowdsourcing facilitation needs to be better understood for this to happen. Here, we turn to affordance theory to develop this understanding. Affordances help us describe action possibilities that characterize the relationship between the facilitator and AI, within macro-task crowdsourcing. We follow a two-stage, bottom-up approach: The initial development stage is based on a structured analysis of academic literature. The subsequent validation & refinement stage includes two observed macro-task crowdsourcing initiatives and six expert interviews. From our analysis, we derive seven AI affordances that support 17 facilitation activities in macro-task crowdsourcing. We also identify specific manifestations that illustrate the affordances.

"In the traditional entrepreneurial process theory, opportunities, resources and entrepreneurs (teams) are regarded as the basic elements of the entrepreneurial process. In the era of artificial intelligence under the new economic normal, the diffusion of technological innovation not only catalyzes the internal components and external environment of entrepreneurship, but more importantly reconstructs a new combination of the key success factors (KSFs) for entrepreneurship. Technological innovation-driven entrepreneurship, as a new form of entrepreneurship, poses new challenges to the traditional entrepreneurial process theory. Using the Co-citation Context Analysis (CCA) method, we innovated the operational definition of the KSFs of entrepreneurship, and horizontally displayed 4 stages of the entrepreneurial process, including 66 key success factors in 17 dimensions. We used the explanatory structural modeling method and Matrice d'Impacts Croises-Multipication Applique A Classement (MICMAC) to analyze and identify the driving force and dependence force of KSFs, and longitudinally present the multi-level structural process relationship of the systematic entrepreneurial process.

"Purpose: Digital advertising enables retailers to rely on large volumes of data on consumers and even leverage artificial intelligence (AI) to target consumers online with personalised and context-aware advertisements. One recent example of such advertisements is programmatic advertising (PA), which is facilitated by automatic bidding systems. Given that retailers are expected to increase their use of PA in the future, further insights on the pros and cons of PA are required. This paper aims to enhance the understanding of the implications of PA use for retailers. Design/methodology/approach: A theoretical overview is conducted that compares PA to traditional advertising, with an empirical investigation into consumer attitudes towards PA (an online survey of 189 consumers using an experimental design) and a research agenda. Findings: Consumer attitudes towards PA are positively related to attitudes towards the retailer. Further, perceived ad relevance is positively related to attitudes towards PA, which is moderated by (1) consumer perceptions of risks related to sharing their data with retailers online and (2) consumer perceptions of AI's positive potential. Surprisingly, the disclosed use of AI for PA does not significantly influence consumer attitudes towards PA. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the literature on technology-enabled services by empirically demonstrating that ad relevance drives consumer attitudes towards PA.

"While digitalization has become a key driver for promoting value creation for customers and stakeholders, much attention is being paid to smart product-service systems (PSS) to meet their diversified needs. When designing smart PSS, there is a strong need to consider growing concerns about the social and ethical impacts of digital technologies. Numerous ethical guidelines for digital technologies, such as artificial intelligence, have been developed. However, a more practical methodology for designing smart PSS by taking into account both positive and negative impacts (including social and ethical impacts) of using digital technologies is anticipated.

"The aim of this study is to examine the effect of shocks to patent intensity and its empirical and practical policy implications for the South African economy. This stems from the gap in the literature on policy simulation exercises related to the boost in Information and Communications Technology (ICT) and patent intensity in African countries. Hence, this study established the dynamic relationship between patent intensity and economic growth in South Africa for the period of 1980–2020, alongside essential macroeconomic variables such as government expenditure, gross fixed capital formation, labour force, and trade. We use the Autoregressive distributed lag model (ARDL) to capture short-run and long-run relationships, novel dynamic ARDL and Kernel-based Regularized Least Squares (KRLS) to capture the counterfactual shocks in the economic growth. The ARDL result revealed that government expenditure, labour force, and trade openness significantly foster economic growth in the long-run and short-run. Also, while patent intensity and gross fixed capital formation increase the economy in the long-run and short-run, their interaction term significantly diminishes the growth. Further in the analysis is the dynamic ARDL simulation and KRLS, which predicted the counterfactual shocks of economic growth based on a + 26 % change in patent intensity. The result showed that the increasing volume of patent intensity first has a low effect on South Africa economic growth, but later rebound upwardly, thus indicating that change in patent intensity has a long-lasting impact on sustainable economic growth. The direction that is useful for policy is also highlighted and discussed. © 2022 The Author(s)",-1,10.1016/j.techfore.2022.122044,"This study examines the relationship between patent intensity and economic growth in South Africa, utilizing various econometric models, including ARDL and KRLS, to analyze short-run and long-run effects.

"Purpose: This is an original piece of research holding the promise to position itself as a pioneering research to showcase the evolving role of Artificial intelligence (AI) in the Indian peer-to-peer lending (P2P) markets. The research effectively uses the holistic multiple case study design to highlight the phenomenon of how AI as the holy grail of investments is proving to be a game changer for the Indian P2P markets. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses a unique research design and curates six Indian licensed Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC)-P2P as exemplary cases to cull out unique contextual findings on how AI has penetrated the Indian P2P market and road ahead. The research is based on a total of 18 semi-structured interviews of six NBFC-P2P founders and 12 Fintech and P2P industry experts. These interviews were used as alternate sources of evidence for data triangulation along with within case analysis, cross-case analysis to achieve well-rounded results. Findings: The findings have been propounded in the form of unique, context specific results achieved with a bouquet of six NBFC-P2P cases and supplemented through triangulation of data done through multiple industry experts. Findings indicate that AI has reached that tipping point in India. Research limitations/implications: There is a scope of further refinement of our results with a larger sample size. Therefore future researches could consider conducting a comprehensive study including all existing NBFC-P2Ps in the space. Practical implications: The research builds perspective for improving the practice in many ways. It shows the way to the other P2Ps still stuck to manual underwriting and see merit in AI-driven processes. It would guide them to embrace new technology driven business models to enhance customer experience and champion service transformation by making financial processes faster and secure. It also highlights how some of the P2Ps are scaling up and improving their visibility and outreach through strategic partnerships. Social implications: The research would assist in creating awareness about the unique P2P sector and AI solutions for individual investors, particularly the “new to credit customers” and “thin file borrowers”. AI led initiatives in the P2P space validate a certain amount of sophistication thereby giving sanctity to the sector and would therefore enforce confidence in the minds of new age investors and borrowers. Originality/value: This original research unravels avenues for novel and untraversed area in the Indian settings where paucity of extant literature and structured data highlighted a research gap and hence necessitated this study.

"AI and data technologies are a catalyst for fundamental changes to insurance business models. The current upheaval is seeing some incumbent insurers trying to do the same more effectively, while others evolve to fully utilize the new capabilities and users these new technologies bring. At the same time, technologically advanced organizations from outside the sector are entering and disrupting it. Within this upheaval however, there are signs of a convergence towards an ideal and prevailing business model. This research identifies one exemplar incumbent and one disruptor and evaluates whether their models are converging and will become similar eventually. The findings support a high degree of convergence, but some differences are likely to remain even after this transitionary period.

"Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) has been used as an engineering risk assessment tool since 1949. FMEAs are effective in preemptively identifying and addressing how a device or process might fail in operation and are often used in the design of high-risk technology applications such as military, automotive industry and medical devices. In this work, we explore whether FMEAs can serve as a risk assessment tool for machine learning practitioners, especially in deploying systems for high-risk applications (e.g. algorithms for recidivism assessment). In particular, we discuss how FMEAs can be used to identify social and ethical failures of Artificial Intelligent Systemss (AISs), recognizing that FMEAs have the potential to uncover a broader range of failures. We first propose a process for developing a Social FMEAs (So-FMEAs) by building on the existing FMEAs framework and a recently published definition of Social Failure Modes by Millar. We then demonstrate a simple proof-of-concept, So-FMEAs for the COMPAS algorithm, a risk assessment tool used by judges to make recidivism-related decisions for convicted individuals. Through this preliminary investigation, we illustrate how a traditional engineering risk management tool could be adapted for analyzing social and ethical failures of AIS.

"This paper discusses how digital technologies including artificial intelligence (AI) reshape the work of lawyers and the organisations that they work for. We overview how AI is being used in legal services, and identify three distinct impacts: AI substitutes automatable legal tasks; AI enhances productivity of lawyers giving advice on the basis of AI-generated outputs; and legal expertise itself augments the deployment of AI when lawyers work as part of a multi-disciplinary team (MDT) encompassing a range of relevant professional expertise. Our survey of English solicitors shows that AI deployment is associated with MDTs, and that MDTs are less prevalent in law firms than in corporations. This latter finding is due to challenges that law firms face as mono-professional partnerships. We find evidence from our interviews that their challenges lie not so much in capital constraints, relaxed via alternative business structures in the UK, but in traditional law firms’ inability to recruit and retain talent other than those in the legal profession. Inadequate adaption is occurring in law firms shifting their structure from a funnel shape to a rocket shape with junior lawyers in partnership tournament working alongside a growing number of non-lawyers whose career paths offer no prospect of partnership. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",-1,10.1080/09695958.2020.1857765,"This paper examines the impact of AI on the legal profession, identifying how it substitutes tasks, enhances productivity, and interacts with multi-disciplinary teams.

"The environmental costs and energy constraints have become emerging issues for the future development of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). So far, the discussion on environmental impacts of ML/AI lacks a perspective reaching beyond quantitative measurements of the energy-related research costs. Building on the foundations laid down by Schwartz et al. (2019) in the GreenAI initiative, our argument considers two interlinked phenomena, the gratuitous generalisation capability and the future where ML/AI performs the majority of quantifiable inductive inferences. The gratuitous generalisation capability refers to a discrepancy between the cognitive demands of a task to be accomplished and the performance (accuracy) of a used ML/AI model. If the latter exceeds the former because the model was optimised to achieve the best possible accuracy, it becomes inefficient and its operation harmful to the environment. The future dominated by the non-anthropic induction describes a use of ML/AI so all-pervasive that most of the inductive inferences become furnished by ML/AI generalisations. The paper argues that the present debate deserves an expansion connecting the environmental costs of research and ineffective ML/AI uses (the issue of gratuitous generalisation capability) with the (near) future marked by the all-pervasive Human-Artificial Intelligence Nexus. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",-1,10.1016/j.futures.2020.102531,"This paper discusses the environmental costs and energy constraints associated with machine learning and AI, emphasizing the inefficiencies of models optimized for accuracy beyond task demands.

The main vendor providers surpassed USD 1 billion in evaluation and the research they are launching these days on the market will change again radically the business landscape. It can be seen already what is coming next to RPA: intelligent optical character recognition (IOCR), chat-bots, machine learning, big data analytics, cognitive platforms, anomaly detection, pattern analysis, voice recognition, data classification and many more. As a result the top vendors developed partnerships with the main leading artificial intelligence providers, such as: IBM Watson, Microsoft Artificial Intelligence, Microsoft Cognitive services, blockchain, Google etc. On the business part, the consulting companies who are implementing the RPA solution are moving from developing Proof-of-Concepts (POCs) and Pilots to helping clients with RAP global roll-outs and developing Centre of Excellences (CoE). As a result, the experiences gathered so far by the author on this kind of projects will be tackled also in this paper. In this article will we will present also some data related to automation for different business areas (eg. Accounts Payable, Accounts Receivable etc) and how an assessment can be done correctly in order to decide if a process can be automatized and, if yes, up to which extent (ie. percent). Moreover, through the case studies we will provide (1) how now the RPA is integrated with Artificial Intelligence and Cloud, (2) how can be scaled in order to face hypes, (3) how can interpret data and (4) what savings these technologies can bring to the organizations.

"This study investigates the interdependence between AI & Robotics stocks and traditional (including stocks and bonds) and alternative (commodities and crypto-currencies) assets, employing wavelet coherence analysis in time-frequency space. We further provide a fresh perspective on potential hedging and diversification benefits of AI & Robotics stocks. Overall, our results suggest that co-movements between AI & Robotics stocks and other assets significantly depend on the wavelet decomposition levels, suggesting time-scale-dependent investment benefits. Wavelet coherences and correlations have substantially increased, mostly in the low frequencies, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Government securities exhibit safe haven properties for investors at the highest and lowest scales. Even if crypto-currencies can provide hedging benefits over the full sample, these benefits seem to be diminished during the COVID-19 period. We observe substantially higher co-movements of AI stocks with the composite stock index, corporate bonds, and commodities at all scales after March 2020, implying that inclusion of these assets in AI & Robotics stock portfolios may not enhance risk-adjusted portfolio performance in times of market turbulence. These results offer potential implications for investors and portfolio managers in terms of hedging/diversification benefits as well as for authorities and policy makers regarding the development of strategies to mitigate financial risk.",-1,10.1016/j/techfore.2021.120989,"This study analyzes the interdependence between AI & Robotics stocks and various asset classes using wavelet coherence analysis.

"The role of artificial intelligence (AI)-based DoctorBots in improving healthcare and the medical industry is expected to increase significantly in the coming decades. However, contrary to the general view that AI can gradually replace human work, user acceptance of DoctorBots has become an obstacle to the development of AI medical diagnosis. Building on the service robot acceptance model (sRAM), this study investigates the potential of the functional, socioemotional, and relational elements of DoctorBots to reconcile the personalization-privacy paradox, thus enhancing user acceptance. Via two scenario-based experiments with 398 participants, this study reveals that the negative influence of the personalization-privacy paradox on user acceptance is exacerbated when users' technology anxiety is high. In addition, an online survey of 400 DoctorBot users indicates that ease of use, subjective social norms, social presence, and rapport are effective in addressing both nonpersonalization (NPC) and privacy concerns (PVC). These findings suggest that the healthcare industry can leverage DoctorBots to implement self-diagnosis. Specifically, DoctorBots' functional elements are effective in mitigating users' NPC, and their relational elements are effective in extenuating users' PVC.",-1,10.1002/cb.2283,"This study examines user acceptance of AI-based DoctorBots in healthcare, focusing on the personalization-privacy paradox and its impact on acceptance.

"Healthcare insurance fraud influences not only organizations by overburdening the already fragile healthcare systems, but also individuals in terms of increasing premiums in health insurance and even fatalities. Identifying the behavioral characteristics of fraudulent claims can help shed light on the development of artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies to detect fraud in health information system research. In this paper, a theoretical model of medical insurance fraud identification is proposed that characterizes the judgment variables of fraud from the three dimensions of time, quantity, and expenses. The model is verified with large-scale, real-world medical records.

"Booking cancelation has a significant impact on hotel management and on the hospitality industry in general. According to some authors, an important portion of hotel revenue loss stems from not considering cancelations in booking systems. Besides, very little is still known about the reasons why customers cancel their bookings, or how this can be effectively avoided from happening. Keeping this in mind, personal name record (PNR) data, which were collected by a hotel partner, were used to design a model to forecast hotel-booking cancelations, which achieved 74% of accuracy. The benefits of the proposed method go beyond such good rate of detection: It only considers 13 different, independent variables, which is a reduced number compared to previous works in the field. Moreover, the included variables coincide with those requested from customers during the hotel reservation process. This is an advantage for hospitality establishments, given that these variables are often the only ones available.

"Customer retention campaigns increasingly rely on predictive models to detect potential churners in a vast customer base. From the perspective of machine learning, the task of predicting customer churn can be presented as a binary classification problem. Using data on historic behavior, classification algorithms are built with the purpose of accurately predicting the probability of a customer defecting. The predictive churn models are then commonly selected based on accuracy related performance measures such as the area under the ROC curve (AUC). However, these models are often not well aligned with the core business requirement of profit maximization, in the sense that, the models fail to take into account not only misclassification costs, but also the benefits originating from a correct classification. Therefore, the aim is to construct churn prediction models that are profitable and preferably interpretable too. The recently developed expected maximum profit measure for customer churn (EMPC) has been proposed in order to select the most profitable churn model. We present a new classifier that integrates the EMPC metric directly into the model construction. Our technique, called ProfTree, uses an evolutionary algorithm for learning profit driven decision trees.

"Governments are increasingly relying on algorithmic decision-making (ADM) to deliver public services. Recent information systems literature has raised concerns regarding ADM's negative unintended consequences, such as widespread discrimination, which in extreme cases can be destructive to society. The extant empirical literature, however, has not sufficiently examined the destructive effects of governmental ADM. In this paper, we report on a case study of the Australian government's ""Robodebt"" programme that was designed to automatically calculate and collect welfare overpayment debts from citizens but ended up causing severe distress to citizens and welfare agency staff. Employing perspectives from systems thinking and organisational limits, we develop a research model that explains how a socially destructive government ADM programme was initiated, sustained, and delegitimized. The model offers a set of generalisable mechanisms that can benefit investigations of ADM's consequences.

"Inclusive innovation has not yet reached societal scale due to a well-entrenched divide between wealth creation and social equity. Taking food as the initial test bed, we have proposed the convergent innovation model to address such challenges still facing 21st century society by bridging sectors and disciplines around an integrated goal on both sides of the social-economic divide for innovations that target wealth creation with an upfront consideration of its externalities. The convergent innovation model is empowered by two key enablers that integrate an advanced digital infrastructure with leading scientific knowledge on the drivers of human behaviour in varying contexts. This article discusses the structure, methods, and development of an artificial intelligence platform to support convergent innovation. Insights are gathered on consumer sentiment and behavioural drivers through the analysis of user-generated content on social media platforms. Empirical results show that user discussions related to marketing, consequences, and occasions are positive. Further regression modelling finds that economic consequences are a strong predictor of consumer global sentiment, but are also sensitive to both the actual price and economic awareness. This finding has important implications for inclusive growth and further emphasizes the need for affordable and accessible foods, as well as for consumer education. Challenges and opportunities inspired by the research results are discussed to inform the design, marketing, and delivery of convergent innovation products and services, while also contributing to dimensions of inclusion and economic performance for equitable health and wealth.",-1,10.22215/timreview/1139,"This paper discusses the development of an AI platform to support a convergent innovation model aimed at addressing social equity and wealth creation in the food sector.

"Purpose: The paper addresses the research problem of the new organizational reality which will include hybrid virtual teams, where both humans and artificial agents will be members and management tasks or leadership roles will be assumed by artificial intelligence. The objectives of the paper are to initially answer 4 research questions: (1) what are the characteristics of virtual teams in the era of intelligent technology, (2) what is the role of technology in changing the human-machine relationship, (3) to what extent can artificial intelligence replace humans in a virtual team, (4) how can team members be replaced by artificial intelligence in a virtual team. Design/methodology/approach: The research method is a literature review and our own empirical research concerning the new organizational reality with hybrid virtual teams consisting of humans as well as artificial agents. The research data was the results of a long-term observation of a virtual team which was conducted in June 2021 in a group of students who worked 36 hours using online management tools in TransistorsHead.com and MS Teams. Findings: The research has shown that virtual teams require different ways of communication and that consequences of working in such a team change the types of tasks, time spent working together as a group and social aspects of cooperation between team members. This experiment has shown that the decision-making process based on artificial entities can fulfill the requirements of virtual teams and that such entities can be considered as teammates or teams (Team As A Software - TAAS).

"E-commerce is experiencing a robust surge, propelled by the worldwide digital transformation and the mutual advantages accrued by both consumers and merchants. The integration of information technologies has markedly augmented the efficacy of digital enterprise, ushering in novel prospects and shaping innovative business paradigms. Nonetheless, adopting information technology is concomitant with risks, notably concerning safeguarding personal data. This substantiates the significance of research within the domain of artificial intelligence for e-commerce, with particular emphasis on the realm of recommender systems. This paper is dedicated to the discourse surrounding the construction of information technology tailored for processing textual descriptions pertaining to commodities within the e-commerce landscape. Through a qualitative analysis, we elucidate factors that mitigate the risks inherent in unauthorized data access. The cardinal insight discerned is that the apt utilization of product matching technologies empowers the formulation of recommendations devoid of entailing customers' personal data or vendors' proprietary information. A meticulously devised structural model of this information technology is proffered, delineating the principal functional components essential for processing textual data found within electronic trading platforms. Central to our exposition is the exploration of the product comparison predicated on textual depictions. The resolution of this challenge stands to enhance the efficiency of product searches and facilitate product juxtaposition and categorization. The prospective implementation of the propounded information technology, either in its entirety or through its constituent elements, augurs well for sellers, enabling them to improve a pricing strategy and heightened responsiveness to market sales trends.

"The telecommunication company functioned in the market with extremely high competitiveness. Attracting new customers needs 5-10 times more expenses than maintaining an existing one. As a result, effective customer churn management and analysis of the reasons for customer churn are vital tasks for telecommunication operators. As a result, predicting subscriber churn by switching on the competitors becomes very important. Data Science and machine learning create enormous opportunities for solving this task to evaluate customer satisfaction with company services, determine factors that cause disappointment, and forecast which clients are at a greater risk of abandoning and changing services suppliers. A company that implements data analysis and modelling to develop customer churn prediction models has an opportunity to improve customer churn management and increase business results. The purposes of the research are the application of machine learning models for a telecommunications company, in particular, the construction of models for predicting the user churn rate and proving that Data Science models and machine learning are high-quality and effective tools for solving the tasks of forecasting the key marketing metrics of a telecommunications company. Based on the example of Telco, the article contains the results of the implementation of various models for classification, such as logistic regression, Random Forest, SVM, and XGBoost, using Python programming language. All models are characterised by high quality (the general accuracy is over 80%). So, the paper demonstrates the feasibility and possibility of implementing the model to classify customers in the future to anticipate subscriber churn (clients who may abandon the company's services) and minimise consumer outflow based on this. The main factors influencing customer churn are established, which is basic information for further forecasting client outflow. Customer outflow prediction models implementation will help to reduce customer churn and maintain their loyalty. The research results can be useful for optimising marketing activity of managing the outflow of consumers of companies on the telecommunication market by developing effective decisions based on data and improving the mathematical methodology of forecasting the outflow of consumers.

We gather the characteristics of filming locations and use a machine-learning technique to define choice sets. We find production incentives can attract movies to a state, but the impact depends on the type of incentive offered, studio characteristics and inherent location geographic characteristics. Mid-sized studios respond to all forms of incentives, major studios respond only to refundable and transferable tax credits, and independent studios are not sensitive to any incentives. We fail to find strong evidence that incentives create a more permanent movie industry in a state. A counterfactual identifies the states most impacted by these policies.

"We provide a new framework to identify demand elasticities in markets where managers rely on algorithmic recommendations for price setting and apply it to a data set containing bookings for a sample of midsized hotels in Europe. Using nonbinding algorithmic price recommendations and observed delay in price adjustments by decision makers, we demonstrate that a control-function approach, combined with state-of-the-art model selection techniques, can be used to isolate exogenous price variation and identify demand elasticities across hotel room types and over time. We confirm these elasticity estimates with a difference-in-differences approach that leverages the same delays in price adjustments by decision makers. However, the difference-in-differences estimates are more noisy and only yield consistent estimates if data are pooled across hotels. We then apply our control-function approach to two classic questions in the dynamic pricing literature: the evolution of price elasticity of demand over and the effects of a transitory price change on future demand due to the presence of strategic buyers. Finally, we discuss how our empirical framework can be applied directly to other decision-making situations in which recommendation systems are used.",-1,10.1287/mnsc.2021.4261,"This paper develops a framework to identify demand elasticities in markets influenced by algorithmic price recommendations, specifically analyzing hotel bookings.

"Many firms are beginning to replace customer service employees with bots, from humanoid service robots to digital chatbots. Using real human-bot interactions in lab and field settings, we study consumers' evaluations of bot-provided service. We find that service evaluations are more negative when the service provider is a bot versus a human-even when the provided service is identical. This effect is explained by consumers' belief that service automation is motivated by firm benefits (i.e., cutting costs) at the expense of customer benefits (such as service quality). The effect is eliminated when firms share the economic surplus derived from automation with consumers through price discounts. The effect is reversed when service bots provide unambiguously superior service to human employees-a scenario that may soon become reality. Consumers' default reactions to service bots are therefore largely negative but can be equal to or better than reactions to human service providers if firms can demonstrate how automation benefits consumers.",-1,10.1093/jcr/ucad023,"This paper examines consumer evaluations of bot-provided services compared to human services, using real interactions in both lab and field settings.

"Nowadays insurance industry has huge innovation potential. Several key vectors for developing the concept of insurance tech include machine learning, business analytics, consumer protection rules, Big Data, artificial intelligence, neural networks, blockchain, and telematics. Technological innovations become widespread only when a community that supports them emerges, and COVID-19 has rapidly accelerated the changes that were already in full swing to a greater extent than any other factor. COVID-19 has helped reinforce the story and ilustrate the results that technologies achieve on a large scale. Modern marketing and management approaches in insurance are viewed as an activity to optimize and control the insurance company's innovation and marketing activities. It would allow taking a strategicaly advantageous position in the insurance market. There are two kinds of insurance marketing: structural and commodity. Structural marketing could help to solve the problem of the economic efficiency of the activity of insurance companies. Commodity marketing helps to improve financial activity and, as a result, to increase profitability. This article summarizes the arguments and counterarguments within the scientific discussion on the place and prospects marketing and management in insurance (strategies, functions, principles) in the context of key innovation metrics. The study's primary purpose is to confirm the hypothesis about the functional link between the level of innovative development of the country and key insurance determinants as drivers for transformation in marketing strategies of insurance companies. In this regard, the array of input data is presented in the form of seven independent variables (regressors), six of which denote innovation measures, one is control variable, and five dependent variables (regressands), which identify the insurance sector. The study of the impact of innovation metrics on the insurance sector of the country in the article is carried out in the following logical sequence: 1) the formation of an array of input data; selection of relevant indicators using Principal Component Analysis; 2) formalization of functional relationships between variables by constructing five-panel Multifactor regression models with Random Effects; and 3) interpretation of the obtained results. Seventeen countries of Central and Eastern Europe were selected as the object of the study for the period from 2004 till 2019. The study empirically confirms the above hypothesis, which is evidenced by the following identified dependences. Key insurance determinants depend on innovation fluctuations. The most significant positive influence on the dependent variables is exercised by the Innovations index, Research and development expenditure, and Patent applications by residents.

"Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is an emerging technology that enables the automation of rules-based business processes and tasks through the use of software bots. Drawing upon the theory of Task-Technology Fit (TTF) and Technology-to-Performance Chain (TPC) (Goodhue and Thompson 1995) and research on expert systems (Messier and Hansen 1987: Sutton 1990), this study explores emerging themes surrounding bot implementation for accounting and finance tasks. We collect and analyze interview data from adopters of RPA and document task suitability, task-technology fit, implementation issues, and resulting performance outcomes. We find that securing technical capability is only a part of RPA implementation process. Organizations engage in standardization and optimization of processes, develop scorecard-like tools to rank tasks, adjust governance structures to include digital employees, and redefine internal controls. Organizations benefit from automating only certain processes, those that are structured, repeated, rules-based, and with digital inputs.
