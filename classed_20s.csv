"Cruising ride-hailing vehicles exacerbate traffic congestion by generating negative externalities. In contrast, reserved ride-hailing services leverage precise information regarding the departure times and origins-destinations of future trips. Platforms can use this data to dispatch and route drivers more efficiently, thereby reducing the need for cruising. Although previous research has largely concentrated on real-time ride-hailing services, the impact of the built environment on reserved ride-hailing remains unexplored with empirical data. This study integrates multi-source data from Haikou City in China and utilizes the gradient boosting decision tree model, which is an interpretable machine learning approach, to investigate potential relationships between reserved ride-hailing trip demand and the built environment. The rankings of relative importance reveal that factors such as the density of food services, education institutions, accessibility to town centers, and proximity to transportation hubs significantly influence the demand for reserved ride-hailing. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that the aforementioned factors exhibit non-linear effects on the demand for reserved ride-hailing. The findings have policy implications for local governments aiming to promote reserved ride-hailing and enhance urban mobility services. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",20,10.1016/j.rtbm.2024.101173,"This study employs a gradient boosting decision tree model to analyze the relationship between the built environment and the demand for reserved ride-hailing services in Haikou City, China.

"The increasing popularity of digital twins, alongside the rapid evolution of connectivity driven by the Internet of Things, highlights their potential to greatly aid in the development of smart cities. Digital twins are employed more commonly as smart cities grow and societies become more interconnected. With the growing need for this technology, there is a pressing demand for the automatic captioning of security events from the videos collected from these models. This is needed as Dtwin models generate a lot of data that makes it difficult to caption them manually. This is required for extracting rich and meaningful higher-level interpretations from images and videos. Current models often lack in-depth insights into these complex urban systems. Additionally, there is a need for a model that can interpret and explain images and videos effectively, leveraging a combination of machine learning and knowledge graph approaches. Therefore, in this paper, we developed the Digital Twin for the buildings and road network of the TEC (Tecnologico De Monterrey) district region and additionally developed the Knowledge Graph models for emulating security events with dense video captioning. This is done by designing an AI-based TEC District Digital Twin for emulating security events by leveraging knowledge graph. The proposed approach provides data and insights about the district's operations and security. This initiative will help district planners and managers to make better decisions by analyzing the real-time data. This is supposed to contribute to increased effectiveness of district services, transparency, and an efficient infrastructure. © 2024 The Authors",20,10.1016/j.joitmc.2024.100297,"This paper focuses on developing an AI-based Digital Twin model for the TEC District to automate the captioning of security events from video data, utilizing machine learning and knowledge graph approaches.

"This research provides a novel framework to estimate the economic, environmental, and social values of electrifying public transit buses, for cities across the world, based on open-source data. Electric buses are a compelling candidate to replace diesel buses for their environmental and social benefits. However, the state-of-art models to evaluate the value of bus electrification require granular and bespoke data on bus operation that can be difficult to procure. This strict requirement on data and modeling can hinder potential collaborators on bus electrification, such as electric vehicle manufacturers or electricity providers, from selecting the candidate public transit agencies in the initial phase of the market investigation. Our valuation tool uses General Transit Feed Specification, a standard data format used by transit agencies worldwide, to provide high-level guidance on developing a prioritization strategy for electrifying a bus fleet. We develop physics-informed machine learning models to evaluate energy consumption, carbon emissions, health impacts, and the total cost of ownership for each transit route. We demonstrate our tool with a case study of the bus lines in the Greater Boston and Milan metropolitan areas. While the capital cost of electric buses and the price of diesel fuel may impact the economic benefit of electrification, we expect significant improvements in health and environmental performances. We estimate about 50% health cost reduction by electrifying only 4 routes out of 15 to 19 routes in each city. For Boston and Milan, some routes are estimated to produce less than 5% of the diesel bus emissions and 14%, respectively, for which investment in electrification can be prioritized.  © 2023 Upadhi Vijay et al.",20,10.1155/2023/5021883,"This research develops a framework using machine learning to estimate the economic, environmental, and social values of electrifying public transit buses, focusing on energy consumption, carbon emissions, and health impacts.

"Saudi Arabia has an ambitious vision that embraces artificial intelligence (AI) technologies at a mass scale in new cities such as Neom. Self-driving has recently become one of the most important AI applications due to the advancement of sensors and AI algorithms. Given that safety is vital to the success of self-driving cars, existing infrastructures (e.g., roads and traffic signs) should be compatible with self-driving technologies. However, self-driving technologies have not been thoroughly examined in Saudi Arabia with regard to the country's infrastructure and traffic. Therefore, this paper highlights the main areas of improvement in available self-driving technologies in Saudi Arabia. This analysis can help governments understand the current limitations of such technologies so that they can regulate them and enhance infrastructures to prepare for the mass adoption of self-driving cars.

"With the development of wireless communication and artificial intelligence technology, online parking reservation system can effectively save drivers' searching time for vacant spaces. However, in the environment with multiple candidate parking lots around the destination, how to coordinate and maximize parking space resources to reduce the travel time is still a practical issue for urban drivers. In order to solve this problem, a collaborative reservation mechanism based on dynamic vehicle path planning is proposed in this paper. By the aid of the dedicated backbone network with a clear division of work responsibilities, the information of traffic and parking lots is collected in real time, based on which the travel time prediction and empty spaces evaluation are executed separately, and then the optimal decision of path planning and parking lot selection can be made and adjusted dynamically by a step-by-step acknowledgement mechanism. The simulation results show that, based on collaborative working and overall planning, our proposed reservation mechanism can effectively raise the utilization rate of the parking lots resources and significantly reduce the travel time for drivers under different traffic environments. Compared to current mechanisms, the collaborative parking reservation mechanism reveals higher feasibility and applicability. It can assist in design and operation of urban traffic management and space resource utilization.  © 2021 Yuting Xiao et al.",20,10.1155/2021/8876069,"This paper proposes a collaborative reservation mechanism for online parking systems that utilizes AI and dynamic vehicle path planning to optimize parking space utilization and reduce travel time for drivers.

"Local governments have made extensive efforts to mitigate urban overheating, cool streetscapes and cities, and protect vulnerable people. However, there is uncertainty about which urban heat mitigation strategies (UHMSs) can provide better solutions for a specific urban context. There is a compelling need for local governments to automate the decision-making process and optimise the combination of UHMSs to maximise the mitigation outcomes for their cities. We develop a novel decision-making framework that incorporates artificial intelligence (AI) techniques into urban heat mitigation in the built environment to enable an automated process of decision making.

"The urbanization problems we face may be alleviated using innovative digital technology. However, employing these technologies entails the risk of creating new urban problems and/or intensifying the old ones instead of alleviating them. Hence, in a world with immense technological opportunities and at the same time enormous urbanization challenges, it is critical to adopt the principles of responsible urban innovation.

"Within the framework of the overarching green development objective guiding the transformation and progress of urban green and low-carbon initiatives, the technological advancements stemming from artificial intelligence have introduced fresh paradigms for reducing urban pollution and enhancing environmental governance. A comprehensive exploration into the influence of artificial intelligence on urban pollution emissions has emerged as a pivotal current concern. The findings that the progression of artificial intelligence has effectively curbed urban pollution emissions, assuming the role of a significant ""speed bump"". Robustness testing corroborated this conclusion. Mechanism testing unveiled that the evolution of artificial intelligence mitigates urban pollution emissions by enhancing production efficiency, minimizing energy consumption, boosting green technology innovation, optimizing industrial structure, and increasing public participation. Heterogeneity analysis underscored substantial variances in the impact of artificial intelligence on urban pollution emissions, influenced by pollutant types, regional disparities, and urban scale differentials.

"Using artificial intelligence and autonomous driving technologies, robotaxis are expected to provide more intelligent, efficient, sustainable, and convenient services as technology advances and market penetration increases. This requires attention to technology investment and market competition at the different stages of robotaxi development. This study aims to reveal the changing rules of R&D investment and market competition for robotaxi services at various stages, considering subsidies, passenger preferences (i.e. walking aversion, safety, additional convenience), and the volatility of benefits from congestion reduction. We developed models to capture the competition between robotaxis and traditional taxis in the three phases of market development — namely, introduction, development, and dominance. The results of this study show that the optimal level of R&D investment is affected by factors such as R&D subsidies, passenger preferences, and the volatility of congestion reduction benefits and that it decreases during the development phase and may further decline during the dominance phase. Additionally, government R&D subsidies should be maintained at a reasonable level to avoid potential strategic conflicts with companies in technology investment and adoption of robotaxi services during the introduction phase. The transition from R&D subsidies to usage subsidies will depend on reaching the perceived safety threshold for robotaxi services. Reducing congestion can play a role similar to the deployment of usage subsidies to promote robotaxi services during the development phase, and can promote R&D investment, robotaxi services, and firm profits in the dominance phase. However, these benefits may be reduced by the volatility of congestion reduction. Policy recommendations and strategies are provided to promote future technological progress and market competition. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",20,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103615,"This study analyzes the dynamics of R&D investment and market competition for robotaxi services, considering factors like subsidies and passenger preferences across different market development stages.

"Brick-and-mortar shopping malls are embracing Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology and recommender systems to enhance the shopping experience and boost mall revenue. Echoing this trend, we formulate a new shopping trip recommendation problem, which aims to recommend a shopping trip (i.e., a list of stores) that matches customer preferences and has appropriate trip lengths. To solve this problem, we develop a novel deep learning-enhanced global planning (DeepGP) approach featuring three methodological novelties. First, we introduce a new shopping intensity term based on deep neural networks to capture the variation of trip lengths specific to different shopping contexts. Second, we innovatively formulate the learning and optimization objectives in a consistent form by balancing the shopping choice likelihood and the shopping intensity likelihood, thus resolving the inconsistency issue encountered by prior global planning methods. Third, to overcome the computational challenge caused by the nonlinear shopping intensity term, we design a new exact and efficient solution technique based on piecewise linear transformations. Using a real-world offline shopping dataset, we empirically demonstrate the superior performances of our approach compared to representative benchmarks in offering more accurate and relevant shopping trip recommendations. Through a simulation, we show the capacity of our approach to attract and balance customer traffic in practical deployments.

"Digital twin technology has great potential to transform urban planning. However, the governance aspects of city-scale digital twins (CDTs)— a virtual representation of urban environments —are understudied. This study bridges this knowledge gap by adopting a framework that scrutinizes the maturity stages of technology. We introduce the CITYSTEPS Maturity Model, a pioneering maturity framework tailored for CDTs, to assess all development stages of CDTs, including those utilizing artificial intelligence, and analyze the technology's role in urban governance. We highlight the promise of CDTs in enhancing public participation in urban planning and addressing key smart city concerns, such as accountability and transparency. However, significant challenges remain, including public participation, public trust in privacy protection, and technical impediments like inadequate data integration, systems integration, and interoperability. There's also the pressing issue of social inclusion: the potential exclusion of marginalized groups, including those often overlooked in data collection, like the hidden homeless and informal sector workers. We propose CDTs should be designed with a human-centric approach, transparent and unbiased data collection and algorithm development, and be led by an adaptive regulatory framework.

"With increasing popularity of ride-hailing services, it becomes important to build transparent and explainable pricing models using artificial intelligence (AI). While the literature on this domain is growing steadily, the application of AI in pricing prediction is relatively new. We drew upon the New York City Taxi dataset to build pricing prediction models to bridge this gap. Our contributions are as follows. First, we created unique clusters for yellow and app-based cabs, leading to a dynamic pricing mechanism across different zones in New York City. Second, we converted a prediction problem into a classification problem by transforming the prices into four distinct quartiles. Third, we applied variable importance schemes to generate top predictors in each cluster. Fourth, our study reveals that differential effects of each predictor for cab-pricing across different clusters exist. Fifth, the “congestion surcharge” is significant for only a few clusters, and imposing such surcharges could hurt the overall taxicab industry.

"Current studies on shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) and road congestion pricing (RCP) mainly focus on their independent effect on mobility, and rarely consider the joint impact of the two policies on accessibility. In light of this incentive, this paper establishes a bi-level programming model with multi-objective functions and multi-decision variables to solve the joint optimal pricing problem of SAVs and RCP considering accessibility. Because of the complex relationship between the decision variables and the objective functions, the proposed bi-level programming model belongs to a black-box problem. A machine learning algorithm based on multi-objective Bayesian optimization was developed to solve the proposed model, by taking Jiangyin City as an empirical case study. The results show that the combined implementation of SAVs and RCP plays an essential role in enhancing the performance of land-use and transportation systems. However, this advantageous outcome relies on an appropriately appropriate pricing strategy. Failing to account for the influence of the pricing strategy on implementation efficacy, SAVs and RCP could result in a 22.2 % and 5.0 % degradation in regional accessibility and total flow time, respectively. In contrast, the joint optimal pricing strategy of SAVs and RCP can not only mitigate traffic congestion and improve transportation network efficiency but also optimize urban spatial distribution and promote compact urban development, ultimately achieving a 14.0 % improvement in regional accessibility and 18.5 % reduction in total flow time. Sensitivity analysis reveals that with the increase in SAV market penetration rate, regional accessibility sees a steady rise. Conversely, the total flow time initially escalates before experiencing a decline. The method proposed in this paper serves not only in determining the joint optimal pricing strategy of SAVs and RCP to enhance accessibility, but also in analyzing and optimizing the accessibility impact of other land-use and transportation policies. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",20,10.1016/j.cities.2023.104742,"This paper develops a bi-level programming model to analyze the joint impact of shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) and road congestion pricing (RCP) on accessibility.

"NAs the demand for taxi reservation services has increased, increasing the income of taxi driverswith advanced services has attracted attention. In this article, we propose a path decision framework that considers real-time spatial-temporal predictions and traffic network information. The goal is to optimize a taxi driver’s profit when considering a reservation. Our framework contains four components. First, we build a grid-based road network graph formodeling traffic network information for speeding up the search process. Next,we conduct two prediction modules that adopt advanced deep learning techniques to guide proper search directions for recommending cruising locations. One module of the taxi demand prediction is used to estimate the pick-up probabilities of passengers in the city. Another one is destination prediction, which can predict the distribution of drop-off probabilities and capture the flow of potential passengers. Finally, we propose the H* (Heuristic-star) algorithm, which jointly considers pick-up probabilities, drop-off distribution, road network, distance, and time factors based on the attentive heuristic function to dynamically recommend next cruising locations. Compared with existing route planning methods, the experimental results on a real-world dataset have shown that our proposed approach is more effective and robust. Moreover, our designed search scheme in H* can decrease the computing time and allow the search process to be more efficient.

"As the mining sector strives to meet its greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets by 2030 and 2050, the need for efficient energy-saving measures becomes paramount. This study presents an improved smart dispatching solution developed using deep reinforcement learning to improve the performance of mining haul truck fleets. The proposed solution based on double deep Q-network (DDQN) trains each truck in the fleet to make real-time decisions based on various factors such as in-situ grade (ore or waste), road traffic, estimated queueing, and maintenance requirements. Scenarios based on a synthetic mine are simulated to evaluate the effectiveness of this DDQN-based artificial intelligence solution versus conventional approaches. Our results demonstrate that the proposed DDQN solution not only improves productivity and reduces fuel-related GHG emissions, but also significantly improves fleet performance in handling operational disruptions (production loss reduced by over 50%) without human intervention, including unexpected changes in fleet size and shovel grade. The cost-effectiveness and scalability of the proposed solution are also assessed. Comparative analysis revealed that upgrading the fleet with the proposed DDQN solution to reduce GHG emissions only equates, on average, 47% and 21% of fleet electrification and carbon capture and storage costs, respectively, and can be rapidly adopted in the near term. These advantages position the smart fleet dispatching system as a cost-effective approach to enhance productivity and reduce direct GHG emissions in mining operations for short-term targets, making it an adaptive technology for future automated and sustainable mining. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",20,10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.140459,"This study proposes a deep reinforcement learning solution to optimize the dispatching of mining haul truck fleets, aiming to improve productivity and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

"Cycling can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution and increase public health. Hence, policymakers in cities worldwide seek to improve bicycle mode shares. Efforts to increase the bicycle's mode share involve many measures, one of them being the improvement of cycling safety often requiring an analysis of the factors surrounding accidents. However, meaningful analysis of cycling safety requires accurate bicycle flow data that are generally sparse or only available at the aggregate level. Therefore, safety engineers often rely on aggregated variables or calibration factors that fail to account for variations in the cycling traffic relevant to policymaking. This paper illustrates how machine learning can support policy analysis by delivering detailed bicycle flow predictions. The illustration applies a Deep Learning approach, the Long Short-Term Memory Mixture Density Network (LSTMMDN), to estimate hourly bicycle flow in Copenhagen, conditional on weather, temporal and road conditions at the segment level. The method addresses some shortcomings in the calibration factor method resulting in 66–77% more accurate bicycle traffic estimates. To quantify the impact of more accurate bicycle traffic estimates in cycling safety analysis, we test the effect of different flow estimates in a bicycle crash risk model, i.e. the models are identical except for the exposure variables. One model is estimated using the LSTMMDN estimates, one using the calibration-based estimates, and one using yearly mean traffic estimates. The results show that investing in more advanced methods for obtaining bicycle volume estimates can improve the quality of safety analyses and other performance measures. © 2023 The Author(s)",20,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103783,"This paper demonstrates the use of a Deep Learning approach to improve bicycle flow predictions, which enhances the analysis of cycling safety.

"Technological applications disrupt the way to assess risks in the auto-insurance business. Contrasted with the common practice based on static demographics, usage-based insurance predicts risks using driving data collected from Internet-of-things–enabled telematics. This study proposes a novel solution leveraging the synergy between big data and hierarchical modeling. We specifically consider two aspects of mobility, namely, trait and trajectory, monitored by global positioning system (GPS), on-board diagnostics, and in-vehicle cameras in real time. Traits here refer to drivers’ distinctive driving behaviors (styles), whereas trajectories consist of the vehicle motion sequences and the contextual factors on trips. We operationalize semantic features of the two to assess risks at both trip and driver levels. Using fine-granular driving data and crash reports, we find that behavioral traits play a significant role in predicting crashes, given individual heterogeneity and temporal dynamics. In a series of empirical validations, the proposed solution outperforms the current practice and alternative predictive models considered by prior literature. We show that the mobility-based models are superior to the demographic-based ones. Moreover, our model achieves the comparable performance of neural networks, improving the recall of class-weighted logistic regression, nested support vector machine, and cost-sensitive random forests by 44.23%, 29.18%, and 24.59%, respectively.

"Sustainable and inclusive urban development requires a thorough understanding of income distribution and poverty. Recent related research has extensively explored the use of automatically generated sensor data to proxy economic activities. Notably, human mobility patterns have been found to exhibit strong associations with socioeconomic attributes and great potential for income estimation. However, the representation of complex human mobility patterns and their effectiveness in income estimation needs further investigation. To address this, we propose three representations of human mobility: mobility indicators, activity footprints, and travel graphs. These representations feed into various models, including XGBoost, a traditional machine learning model, a convolutional neural network (CNN), and a time-series graph neural network (GCRN). By leveraging public transit data from Shenzhen, our study demonstrates that graph-based representations and deep learning models outperform other approaches in income estimation. They excel in minimising information loss and handling complex data structures. Spatial contextual attributes, such as transport accessibility, are the most influential factors, while indicators related to activity extent, temporal rhythm, and intensity contribute comparatively less. In summary, this study highlights the potential of cutting-edge artificial intelligence tools and emerging human mobility data as an alternative approach to estimating income distribution and addressing poverty-related concerns. © 2023 The Authors",20,10.1016/j.apgeog.2023.103179,This study investigates the use of human mobility patterns and advanced AI models to estimate income distribution and address poverty.

"Last decades have been marked by deep socio-economic transformations, an uneven evolution of transport demand in main urban areas and the emergence of new and more sustainable modes of transportation (carpooling, self-services bicycles). These changes have strongly impacted the interaction between service supply and demand in the transport industry. In this context, passive data as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth become a key source of information to understand individual mobility behaviors and ensure the sustainable development of transport infrastructures. In this paper, we present a framework that uses disruptive technology to collect passive data in buses, continuously and at a lower cost than traditional mobility surveys. Previous research, conducted over a more limited spatial and temporal framework, uses filtering methods, which do not allow the results to be replicated. This study uses artificial intelligence to sort transmitted signals, get transit ridership and build Origin–Destination matrices.

"In optimization of a shared autonomous electric vehicle (SAEV) system, idle vehicle relocation strategies are important to reduce operation costs and customers’ wait time. However, for an on-demand service, continuous optimization for idle vehicle relocation is computationally expensive, and thus, not effective. This study proposes a deep learning-based algorithm that can instantly predict the optimal solution to idle vehicle relocation problems under various traffic conditions. The proposed relocation process comprises three steps. First, a deep learning-based passenger demand prediction model using taxi big data is built. Second, idle vehicle relocation problems are solved based on predicted demands, and optimal solution data are collected. Finally, a deep learning model using the optimal solution data is built to estimate the optimal strategy without solving relocation. In addition, the proposed idle vehicle relocation model is validated by applying it to optimize the SAEV system.

"As a promising sustainable mode of transportation, electric carsharing can relieve the urban traffic pressure and environmental pollution problems, which has been promoted all over the world to reduce or replace fossil-fueled private cars. However, the operation of electric carsharing is faced with difficulties in profitability and management. Vehicle relocation can alleviate the imbalance between supply and demand, and compared with operator-based relocation, user-based relocation is more sustainable and cost-efficient. In this paper, we develop a user-based relocation model with the optimization objectives of profit maximization and using failure rate minimization. Two station pricing schemes of pure preferential and preferential combined with fine are proposed as the constraints. For the input of the relocation model, the back propagation neural network of the quantity demand and the distribution fitting model of the energy demand are constructed to predict user demand. The demand prediction model and relocation model are validated through the operation data of EVCARD in Shanghai. The results demonstrate that the user-based relocation can effectively reduce the using failure rate and has the potential to increase the net profit. Compared with the situation without vehicle relocation, the user-based relocation strategy can reduce using failure rate by 13.6% and increase net profit by 76.9% in the best situation. Through sensitivity analysis of key parameters, it is found that the station pricing of pure preferential can reduce the using failure rate, but the profitability of the electric carsharing system is weakened.

"Ridesourcing or on-demand ridesharing, offers a sustainable mobility option that connects drivers with passengers via mobile application directly, which helps reduce unnecessary vehicle cruising and energy consumption. It plays a crucial role in urban mobility within the built environment. However, the interdependency between ridesourcing usage and built environment has not been addressed adequately, particularly in the critical regions that have significant influence on ridesourcing usage in an urban context. Based on percolation theory, this study suggests a new concept, namely ridesourcing usage islands, defined as geographical areas of interest with a high or low concentration of ridesourcing usage. Within these noteworthy areas, a machine learning method, gradient boosting decision trees (GBDT), is further innovatively adopted to investigate the refined and discontinuous non-linear impacts of built environment on ridesourcing usage. The results reveal a hierarchical structure of ridesourcing usage islands. Regional imbalances of travel supply and demand at usage island level are sporadically identified across several regions. Besides, the formation of usage islands is highly influenced by the surrounding built environment. Most importantly, employment density and residential density have joint contribution of almost 20% for ridesourcing pick up demand and drop off demand respectively, reflecting the role of ridesourcing in commuting. Regardless of island's type, built environment features show obvious threshold effects on ridesourcing usage, and their specific effective ranges are different from each other.

"The main aims of urban air pollution monitoring are to optimize the interaction between humanity and nature, to combine and integrate environmental databases, and to develop sustainable approaches to the production and the organization of the urban environment. One of the main applications of urban air pollution monitoring is for exposure assessment and public health studies. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) approaches can be used to build air pollution models to predict pollutant concentrations and assess environmental and health risks. Air pollution data can be uploaded into AI/ML models to estimate different exposure levels within different communities. The correlation between exposure estimates and public health surveys is important for assessing health risks. These aspects are critical when it concerns environmental injustice. Computational approaches should efficiently manage, visualize, and integrate large datasets. Effective data integration and management are a key to the successful application of computational intelligence approaches in ecology. In this paper, we consider some of these constraints and discuss possible ways to overcome current problems and environmental injustice. The most successful global approach is the development of the smart city; however, such an approach can only increase environmental injustice as not all the regions have access to AI/ML technologies. It is challenging to develop successful regional projects for the analysis of environmental data in the current complicated operating conditions, as well as taking into account the time, computing power, and constraints in the context of environmental injustice. © 2022 by the authors.

"Digital transformation (or digitalization) is the process of continuous further development of digital technologies (such as smart devices, cloud services, and Big Data) that have a lasting impact on our economy and society. In this manner, digitalization is a huge driver for permanent change, even in the field of Sustainable Urban Development. In the wake of digitalization, expectations are changing, placing pressure at the societal level on the design and development of smart environments for everything that means Sustainable Urban Development. In this sense, the solution is the integration of Artificial Intelligence into Sustainable Urban Development, because technology can simplify people’s lives. The aim of this paper is to ascertain which Sustainable Urban Development dimensions are taken into account when integrating Artificial Intelligence and what results can be achieved. These questions formed the basic framework for this research article. In order to make the current state of Artificial Intelligence in Sustainable Urban Development as a snapshot visible, a systematic review of the current literature between 2012 and 2022 was conducted. The data were collected and analyzed using PRISMA. Based on the studies identified, we found a significant growth in studies, starting in 2018, and that Artificial Intelligence applications refer to the Sustainable Urban Development dimensions of environmental protection, economic development, social justice and equity, culture, and governance. The used Artificial Intelligence techniques in Sustainable Urban Development cover a broad field of Artificial Intelligence, such as Artificial Intelligence in general, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Artificial Neuronal Networks, Operations Research, Predictive Analytics, and Data Mining. However, with the integration of Artificial Intelligence in Sustainable Urban Development, challenges are marked out. These include responsible municipal policies, awareness of data quality, privacy and data security, the formation of partnerships among stakeholders (e.g., local citizens, civil society, industry, and various levels of government), and transparency and traceability in the implementation and rollout of Artificial Intelligence. A first step was taken towards providing an overview of the possible applications of Artificial Intelligence in Sustainable Urban Development. It was clearly shown that Artificial Intelligence is also gaining ground in this sector. © 2022 by the authors.",20,10.3390/bdcc7010003,"This paper conducts a systematic literature review to explore the integration of AI into Sustainable Urban Development, identifying dimensions such as environmental protection and economic development.

"Online ride-hailing as an innovative travel mode becomes increasingly popular in cities around the world. To improve the efficiency of dispatching system of ride-hailing, many ride-hailing demand prediction models based on deep learning architecture have been proposed to reduce the gross travel distance between drivers and passengers. However, in most of these prediction models, only the error metrics are used for performance evaluation. There is scarce evidence on how much the demand prediction model reduces the unnecessary travel distance in reality. In this study, a multi-scenario-based method is proposed to evaluate technical potentials of the ride-hailing demand prediction model in ride-hailing dispatching system simulation. The ride-hailing dispatching is simulated in three scenarios: traditional dispatching system, prediction model-based dispatching system, and perfect prediction model-based dispatching system. One-month data of Didi Express service provided by Didi Chuxing GAIA Initiative in Chengdu is employed to support the simulation. Two terms, empty distance and relative performance, are introduced as the criteria of prediction model performance measurement. Simulation results reveal that the total empty distance reduced 1,164 km per day by using the prediction model compared with the traditional dispatching system. The relative performance is only 58.9% compared with the perfect prediction model-based dispatching system. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",20,10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.123706,"This study proposes a multi-scenario method to evaluate the effectiveness of a deep learning-based ride-hailing demand prediction model in reducing unnecessary travel distances in dispatching systems.

"Matching buyers with most suitable sellers providing relevant items (e.g., products) is essential for e-commerce platforms to guarantee customer experience. This matching process is usually achieved through modeling inter-group (buyer-seller) proximity by e-commerce ranking systems. However, current ranking systems often match buyers with sellers of various qualities, and the mismatch is detrimental to not only buyers' level of satisfaction but also the platforms' return on investment (ROI). In this paper, we address this problem by incorporating intra-group structural information (e.g., buyer-buyer proximity implied by buyer attributes) into the ranking systems. Specifically, we propose Deep Graph Embedding (DEGREE), a deep learning based method, to exploit both inter-group and intra-group proximities jointly for structural learning. With a sparse filtering technique, DEGREE can significantly improve the matching performance with computation resources less than that of alternative deep learning based methods. Experimental results demonstrate that DEGREE outperforms state-of-the-art graph embedding methods on real-world e-commence datasets. In particular, our solution boosts the average unit price in purchases during an online A/B test by up to 11.93%, leading to better operational efficiency and shopping experience. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

"As in a typical two-sided market, the competition between transportation network companies (TNCs) can lead to market fragmentation and loss of matching efficiency between passengers and drivers, whereas a monopoly market may result in the dominant TNC abusing its market power. Therefore, whether to encourage or discourage competition between TNCs is a debatable question for cities. Prior studies explored this question mostly through mathematical equilibrium models, but few have comprehensively investigated it based on empirical analysis using real-world data. To fill this gap, this study proposes a framework to measure and analyze the competition between TNCs using the most accessible ride-hailing trip data. Specifically, using an interpretable machine learning model, we investigate how TNCs’ pricing and wage strategies influence their market shares and how competition intensity affects passenger cost and driver income. The results based on large-scale trip records from four TNCs in New York City show that the pricing strategy is more influential than the wage strategy on the market shares and competition intensity. Instead of the top TNC, it is the strategies of challenger TNCs (with sizeable but not the biggest market shares) that affect the competition more. Both the passenger cost and driver income can benefit from competition even after considering the potential loss of matching efficiency, while TNCs’ profits shrink with growing competition intensity. These findings suggest that cities should encourage competition between TNCs, yet within a limit. They add empirical evidence to prior studies and provide implications for regulating TNC competition. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",20,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103861,"This study empirically analyzes the competition between transportation network companies (TNCs) using real-world ride-hailing data.

"Accurate estimation of intercity heavy truck mobility flows is of vital importance to urban planning, transportation management and logistics operations. The inaccessibility of big data related to intercity transport systems and the heterogeneity of trucking activities pose challenges for the reliable estimation. Recently, the advance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) provides a potential solution to this problem. However, most previous studies focused on the estimation of inter-regional passenger mobility. In-depth studies of estimating intercity heavy truck mobility flows by using deep learning techniques are still scarce. To fill in the gaps, we construct a deep neural network based on the Deep Gravity framework, an advanced predictive model for human mobility. We collect a wide range of data related to heavy truck movements, freight locations, road networks and land uses to train the model, and validate its high performance by comparing to traditional gravity model. Furthermore, we use an explainable AI technique to interpret how the city features contribute to the determination of intercity heavy truck movements, and the results can provide valuable policy implications for logistics operations, businesses and urban planning. © 2023",20,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103320,"This paper focuses on estimating intercity heavy truck mobility flows using a deep learning model based on the Deep Gravity framework.

"Accurately forecasting ridesourcing demand is important for effective transportation planning and policy making. With the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI), researchers have started to utilize machine learning models to forecast travel demand, which, in many cases, can produce higher prediction accuracy than statistical models. However, most existing machine-learning studies used a global model to predict the demand and ignored the influence of spatial heterogeneity (i.e., the spatial variations in the impacts of explanatory variables). Spatial heterogeneity can drive the parameter estimations varying over space; failing to consider the spatial variations may limit the model's prediction performance. To account for spatial heterogeneity, this study proposes a Clustering-aided Ensemble Method (CEM) to forecast the zone-to-zone (census-tract-to-census-tract) travel demand for ridesourcing services. Specifically, we develop an interactive clustering approach (powered by human in-the-loop AI) to split the origin-destination pairs into different clusters and ensemble the cluster-specific machine learning models for prediction. We implement and test the proposed methodology by using the ridesourcing-trip data in Chicago. The results show that, with a more transparent and flexible model structure, the CEM significantly improves the prediction accuracy than the benchmark models (i.e., global machine learning and statistical models directly trained on all observations). This study offers transportation researchers and practitioners a new methodology of travel demand forecasting, especially for new travel modes like ridesourcing and micromobility.",20,10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2022.103310,"This paper proposes a Clustering-aided Ensemble Method (CEM) to improve the forecasting of ridesourcing demand by addressing spatial heterogeneity in travel data.

"The quantitative implications of Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) for travel equity and transportation system performance are underexplored, a gap primarily attributed to the complexities of forecasting travel pattern shifts in response to a broad spectrum of MaaS bundles via conventional methodologies. In this study, we utilize Neural Network models to identify the primary characteristics that influence the use of various travel modes, drawing upon data from a stated preference (SP) survey administered in Hong Kong. We evaluate the repercussions of enforcing various equity metric constraints on system efficiency and undertake a thorough analysis of the ensuing variations in system emissions and profitability. Our findings highlight the profound influence of established pre-MaaS travel patterns on subsequent behaviors following MaaS introduction. Moreover, our findings reveal that socio-demographic characteristics exert a greater impact on travel mode usage than the attributes of MaaS bundles, highlighting the entrenched lifestyle preferences and economic conditions that shape travel behavior. Furthermore, our research reveals that while the enforcement of equity constraints typically reduces system efficiency, specific ranges exist where such enforcement may be advantageous in terms of emission reductions and increased profitability for MaaS platforms.",20,10.1016/j.tranpol.2024.05.018,"This study employs Neural Network models to analyze the impact of Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) on travel equity and transportation system performance, focusing on how travel patterns shift in response to different MaaS bundles.

"Public transit provides an affordable and reliable transport option especially to the vulnerable groups. However, the relevance of transit accessibility to the daily mobility of different social strata has not been fully understood. It remains unclear to what extent the low-income may benefit from enhanced transit accessibility compared to others. Focusing on an Asian metropolis-Hong Kong, this study investigates the interplay between transit accessibility and daily trip duration with a particular focus on the low-income population via a machine-learning approach (Gradient Boosting Decision Tree). Our findings indicate that network accessibility by Mass Transit Rail (MTR) exerts a weaker effect on the duration of mandatory and discretionary trips of the low-income than for the non-low-income for these trips. This implies the presence of possible barriers of using MTR among the lowincome. Moreover, marked threshold effects are identified for both MTR and bus accessibility especially in relation to the mandatory and maintenance trips of the low-income. Based on these findings, policy recommendations are proposed to help strengthen the linkage between improvement of transit accessibility and equitable mobility conditions across society.",20,10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2023.103600,"This study uses a machine learning approach to analyze the relationship between transit accessibility and daily trip duration, specifically focusing on the low-income population in Hong Kong.

"In order to investigate the acceptance of a Pay-How-You-Drive (PHYD) road pricing system in Athens, Greece, a novel scheme is proposed which is designed to provide recommendations to the drivers in order to change their behavior towards a more ecological one and charges more those that would not follow them. For modeling the acceptance of the system's recommendations, first, a stated preferences questionnaire survey was designed and conducted on 600 drivers. Next, several Machine Learning models were developed to identify the characteristics that may affect the acceptance of such a scheme. To enrich the modeling process, a clustering framework was exploited to separate the respondents into different profiles, based on their mobility pattern and their attitude towards eco-driving. Furthermore, novel interpretation techniques, namely the calculation of permutation importance and partial dependence, were applied to gain a deeper understanding of the models' outputs. Findings revealed that the percent of travel time increase when following the system's recommendation and the offered discount are the most important determinants of the system's acceptance. More specifically, the estimation of the value of time showed that those who would drive ecologically would expect a discount of 0.21euro for each minute of additional travel time. The results of this research can be exploited in the design of fair toll systems that will meet the requirements of potential users, as well as the needs of demand responsive and eco-friendly urban road networks.",20,10.1016/j.tra.2022.01.009,"This paper investigates the acceptance of a Pay-How-You-Drive (PHYD) road pricing system in Athens, utilizing machine learning models to analyze driver behavior and preferences.
