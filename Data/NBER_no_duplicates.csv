"JOUR","Understanding the behavior of users online is important for researchers, policymakers, and private companies alike. But observing online behavior and conducting experiments is difficult without direct access to the user base and software of technology companies. We introduce Webmunk, an open-source tool designed to make conducting online studies much easier. The user-facing side of Webmunk is a browser extension that can track consumer browsing behavior and experimentally modify consumers experiences as they browse the Internet. It can be installed just like any other browser extension, such as ad blockers. Through this extension, researchers can collect a host of consumer data, from URLs to web page HTML elements, clicks, and scroll positions. The extension can also modify information and change the look of a web page, allowing for researchers to implement interventions that vary across study participants. A key advantage of this approach is that interventions occur while participants are engaging in real world activities such as shopping, browsing the news, using social media, or searching for information. We demonstrate the power of Webmunk by discussing two studies in progress.","B","webmunk: a new tool for studying online behavior and digital platforms","karr, chris","10.3386/w32694","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w32694.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Chiara Farronato Harvard Business School Morgan Hall 427 Soldiers Field Boston, MA 02163 Tel: 617/495-6542 E-Mail: cfarronato@hbs.edu  Andrey Fradkin Questrom School of Business Boston University Rafik B.

"JOUR","The United States criminal justice system is characterized by substantial disparities in outcomes across racial and ethnic groups. Understanding these disparities requires accurate measures of race and ethnicity of people involved in the justice system. We document how race and ethnicity are recorded by administrative agents and how operational concerns limit corrections to misreported race and ethnicity. To understand the impacts of these administrative processes, this paper uses novel linkages between person-level microdata from the Criminal Justice Administrative Records System (CJARS) and race and ethnicity composites from U.S. Census Bureau census and administrative records, mostly composed of self-reported or family-reported race/ethnicity, to quantify mismeasurement of race and ethnicity in the justice system. We find that 17 percent of misdemeanor and felony defendants and 10 percent of prison inmates have an agency-recorded label that does not concord with the composite measure, largely driven by justice agencies poorly measuring people identified in Census Bureau data as Hispanic, Asian, Pacific Islander, or American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN). Using estimated correspondences between agency-recorded and the composite race and ethnicity, we reweight federal series on imprisonment rates and show that those series, which currently rely on small survey samples to impute racial and ethnic population shares, have substantially underestimated the incarceration rates of Whites, Blacks, and AIANs.","B","race and ethnicity (mis)measurement in the u.s. criminal justice system","mueller-smith, michael g","10.3386/w32657","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w32657.pdf",NA,NA,"presented at ""CRIW Race, Ethnicity, and Economic Statistics for the 21st Century"", March 14-15, 2024","Author contact info: Keith Finlay U.S. Census Bureau 4600 Silver Hill Road Washington, DC 20233 United States Tel: 3017636056 E-Mail: keith.ferguson.finlay@census.gov  Elizabeth Luh E-Mail: eluh@uh.edu  Michael G.

"JOUR","Despite its promise to help low-wealth households manage climate risk, index insurance remains hampered by downside basis risk, meaning that an insured party suffers a loss, but receives no payment because the insurance index fails to register a loss. While efforts to reduce basis risk focus on the creation of indices that better predict losses, this paper focuses on the creation of statistically rigorous insurance zones that minimize downside basis risk. In contrast to our approach, most existing index insurance contracts use statistically ad hoc administrative boundaries to demarcate insurance zones. To improve on this practice, we develop a machine learning algorithm that forms zones to maximizes lower tail dependence within the zone. After exploring the logic for using lower tail dependence, we apply our algorithm to the long-running index-based livestock insurance contract in Northern Kenya. We show that compared to the currently employed administrative insurance areas, our algorithm creates an insurance contract that increases the expected utility value of the insurance by 60-200% even when keeping the number of zones the same. Optimizing the number of zones using our method can further increase the economic value of index insurance to its beneficiaries.","B","breaking boundaries: lower tail dependence can triple the economic value of index insurance for rural households","escribano, álvaro","10.3386/w32618","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w32618.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Enrique Estefania-Salazar Research Centre for the Management of Agricultural and Environmental Risks (CEIGRAM)  Universidad Politécnica de Madrid Madrid, 28040 Spain E-Mail: enrique.esalazar@upm.es  Michael Carter Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics University of California, Davis One Shields Avenue Davis, CA 95616 Tel: 530/752-4672 Fax: 530/752-5614 E-Mail: mrcarter@ucdavis.edu  Eva Iglesias Research Centre for the Management of Agricultural and Environmental Risks (CEIGRAM)  Universidad Politécnica de Madrid Madrid, 28040 Spain E-Mail: eva.iglesias@upm.es  Álvaro Escribano Department of Economics Universidad Carlos III de Madrid Getafe, 28093 Spain E-Mail: alvaro.escribano@uc3m.es",2024,"http://www.nber.org/papers/w32618","No. 32618","Jun-24",NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE

"JOUR","Do stronger intellectual property rights incentivize female participation in innovation? We provide new evidence on this question using a unique database of artificial intelligence patents publicly shared by the USPTO. Our identification strategy leverages China’s WTO TRIPs accession, which led to stronger intellectual property rights in 2002. We find a significant rise in the number of female inventors and an increase in the number of patents with females on inventor teams vis-a-vis a control group of countries. We also find that after stronger intellectual property rights, the quality of Chinese artificial intelligence patents with female inventors on the team improved. Results are robust controlling for unobserved heterogeneity at the country, technology class, and over time. Additional robustness tests with synthetic controls, coarsened exact matching, randomized inference and alternative control groups support our benchmark findings. Our results highlight that stronger intellectual property rights can be helpful in improving gender division of labor thereby benefiting society and innovation.","B","do stronger ipr incentivize female participation in innovation? evidence from chinese ai patents","higgins, matthew j","10.3386/w32547","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w32547.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Shubhangi Agrawal University of Edinburgh Department of Economics United Kingdom E-Mail: sagrawal@ed.ac.uk  Sawan Rathi University of Sussex Science Policy Research Unit (SPRU) United Kingdom E-Mail: s.rathi@sussex.ac.uk  Chirantan Chatterjee University of Sussex Business School UK E-Mail: c.chatterjee@sussex.ac.uk  Matthew J.

"JOUR","Drawing insights from the field of innovation economics, we discuss the likely competitive environment shaping generative AI advances. Central to our analysis are the concepts of appropriability—whether firms in the industry are able to control the knowledge generated by their innovations—and complementary assets—whether effective entry requires access to specialized infrastructure and capabilities to which incumbent firms can ration access. While the rapid improvements in AI foundation models promise transformative impacts across broad sectors of the economy, we argue that tight control over complementary assets will likely result in a concentrated market structure, as in past episodes of technological upheaval. We suggest the likely paths through which incumbent firms may restrict entry, confining newcomers to subordinate roles and stifling broad sectoral innovation. We conclude with speculations regarding how this oligopolistic future might be averted. Policy interventions aimed at fractionalizing or facilitating shared access to complementary assets might help preserve competition and incentives for extending the generative AI frontier. Ironically, the best hopes for a vibrant open source AI ecosystem might rest on the presence of a “rogue” technology giant, who might choose openness and engagement with smaller firms as a strategic weapon wielded against other incumbents.","A","old moats for new models: openness, control, and competition in generative ai","nagaraj, abhishek","10.3386/w32474","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w32474.pdf","published as Pierre Azoulay, Joshua Krieger, Abhishek Nagaraj.

"JOUR","Machine learning algorithms can find predictive signals that researchers fail to notice; yet they are notoriously hard-to-interpret. How can we extract theoretical insights from these black boxes? History provides a clue. Facing a similar problem – how to extract theoretical insights from their intuitions – researchers often turned to “anomalies:” constructed examples that highlight flaws in an existing theory and spur the development of new ones. Canonical examples include the Allais paradox and the Kahneman-Tversky choice experiments for expected utility theory. We suggest anomalies can extract theoretical insights from black box predictive algorithms. We develop procedures to automatically generate anomalies for an existing theory when given a predictive algorithm. We cast anomaly generation as an adversarial game between a theory and a falsifier, the solutions to which are anomalies: instances where the black box algorithm predicts - were we to collect data - we would likely observe violations of the theory. As an illustration, we generate anomalies for expected utility theory using a large, publicly available dataset on real lottery choices. Based on an estimated neural network that predicts lottery choices, our procedures recover known anomalies and discover new ones for expected utility theory. In incentivized experiments, subjects violate expected utility theory on these algorithmically generated anomalies; moreover, the violation rates are similar to observed rates for the Allais paradox and Common ratio effect.","B","from predictive algorithms to automatic generation of anomalies","rambachan, ashesh","10.3386/w32422","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w32422.pdf",NA,NA,"presented at ""SI 2023 Digital Economics and Artificial Intelligence"", July 19-21, 2023","Author contact info: Sendhil Mullainathan Booth School of Business University of Chicago 5807 South Woodlawn Avenue Chicago, IL 60637 Tel: 773/834-2353 E-Mail: sendhil.mullainathan@gmail.com  Ashesh Rambachan Department of Economics MIT Cambridge, MA E-Mail: asheshr@mit.edu",2024,"http://www.nber.org/papers/w32422","No. 32422","May-24",NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE

By applying natural language processing techniques to documents that Federal Reserve staff prepare in advance of policy decisions, we capture the Fed's information set. Using machine learning techniques, we then predict changes in the target interest rate conditional on this information set and obtain a measure of monetary policy shocks as the residual. We show that the documents' text contains essential information about the economy which is not captured by numerical forecasts that the staff include in the same documents. The dynamic responses of macro variables to our monetary policy shocks are consistent with the theoretical consensus. Shocks constructed by only controlling for the staff forecasts imply responses of macro variables at odds with theory.

"JOUR","David Ricardo initially believed machinery would help workers but revised his opinion, likely based on the impact of automation in the textile industry. Despite cotton textiles becoming one of the largest sectors in the British economy, real wages for cotton weavers did not rise for decades. As E.P. Thompson emphasized, automation forced workers into unhealthy factories with close surveillance and little autonomy. Automation can increase wages, but only when accompanied by new tasks that raise the marginal productivity of labor and/or when there is sufficient additional hiring in complementary sectors. Wages are unlikely to rise when workers cannot push for their share of productivity growth. Today, artificial intelligence may boost average productivity, but it also may replace many workers while degrading job quality for those who remain employed. As in Ricardo’s time, the impact of automation on workers today is more complex than an automatic linkage from higher productivity to better wages.","A","learning from ricardo and thompson: machinery and labor in the early industrial revolution, and in the age of ai","johnson, simon","10.3386/w32416","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w32416.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Daron Acemoglu Department of Economics, E52-446 Massachusetts Institute of Technology 77 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02139 Tel: 617/253-1927 Fax: 617/253-1330 E-Mail: daron@mit.edu  Simon Johnson MIT Sloan School of Management 100 Main Street, E52-562 Cambridge, MA 02142 Tel: 617/290-9618 Fax: 617/253-2660 E-Mail: sjohnson@mit.edu",2024,"http://www.nber.org/papers/w32416","No. 32416","May-24",NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE
"JOUR","We present an approach for automatically generating and testing, in silico, social scientific hypotheses. This automation is made possible by recent advances in large language models (LLM), but the key feature of the approach is the use of structural causal models. Structural causal models provide a language to state hypotheses, a blueprint for constructing LLM-based agents, an experimental design, and a plan for data analysis. The fitted structural causal model becomes an object available for prediction or the planning of follow-on experiments. We demonstrate the approach with several scenarios: a negotiation, a bail hearing, a job interview, and an auction. In each case, causal relationships are both proposed and tested by the system, finding evidence for some and not others. We provide evidence that the insights from these simulations of social interactions are not available to the LLM purely through direct elicitation. When given its proposed structural causal model for each scenario, the LLM is good at predicting the signs of estimated effects, but it cannot reliably predict the magnitudes of those estimates. In the auction experiment, the in silico simulation results closely match the predictions of auction theory, but elicited predictions of the clearing prices from the LLM are inaccurate. However, the LLM's predictions are dramatically improved if the model can condition on the fitted structural causal model. In short, the LLM knows more than it can (immediately) tell.","B","automated social science: language models as scientist and subjects","horton, john j","10.3386/w32381","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w32381.pdf",NA,NA,"presented at ""SI 2024 Digital Economics and Artificial Intelligence"", July 17-19, 2024","Author contact info: Benjamin S.

"JOUR","Categorical variables have no intrinsic ordering, and researchers often adopt a fixed-effect (FE) approach in empirical analysis. However, this approach has two significant limitations: it overlooks textual labels associated with the categorical variables; and it produces unstable results when there are only limited observations in a category. In this paper, we propose a novel method that utilizes recent advances in large language models (LLMs) to recover overlooked information in categorical variables. We apply this method to investigate labor market mismatch. Specifically, we task LLMs with simulating the role of a human resources specialist to assess the suitability of an applicant with specific characteristics for a given job. Our main findings can be summarized in three parts. First, using comprehensive administrative data from an online job posting platform, we show that our new match quality measure is positively correlated with several traditional measures in the literature, and at the same time, we highlight the LLM's capability to provide additional information conditional on the traditional measures. Second, we demonstrate the broad applicability of the new method with a survey data containing significantly less information than the administrative data, which makes it impossible to compute most of the traditional match quality measures. Our LLM measure successfully replicates most of the salient patterns observed in a hard-to-access administrative dataset using easily accessible survey data. Third, we investigate the gender gap in match quality and explore whether there exists gender stereotypes in the hiring process. We simulate an audit study, examining whether revealing gender information to LLMs influences their assessment. We show that when gender information is disclosed to the GPT, the model deems females better suited for traditionally female-dominated roles.","B","recovering overlooked information in categorical variables with llms: an application to labor market mismatch","zhao, zibo","10.3386/w32327","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w32327.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Yi Chen 393 Middle Huaxia Road ShanghaiTech University School of Entrepreneurship and Management Shanghai 201210 CHINA Tel: 86-021-20684771 E-Mail: chenyiecon@163.com  Hanming Fang Department of Economics Ronald O.

"JOUR","Timely and accurate measurement of AI use by firms is both challenging and crucial for understanding the impacts of AI on the U.S. economy. We provide new, real-time estimates of current and expected future use of AI for business purposes based on the Business Trends and Outlook Survey for September 2023 to February 2024. During this period, bi-weekly estimates of AI use rate rose from 3.7% to 5.4%, with an expected rate of about 6.6% by early Fall 2024. The fraction of workers at businesses that use AI is higher, especially for large businesses and in the Information sector. AI use is higher in large firms but the relationship between AI use and firm size is non-monotonic. In contrast, AI use is higher in young firms although, on an employment-weighted basis, is U-shaped in firm age. Common uses of AI include marketing automation, virtual agents, and data/text analytics. AI users often utilize AI to substitute for worker tasks and equipment/software, but few report reductions in employment due to AI use. Many firms undergo organizational changes to accommodate AI, particularly by training staff, developing new workflows, and purchasing cloud services/storage. AI users also exhibit better overall performance and higher incidence of employment expansion compared to other businesses. The most common reason for non-adoption is the inapplicability of AI to the business.","A","tracking firm use of ai in real time: a snapshot from the business trends and outlook survey","savage, keith","10.3386/w32319","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w32319.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Kathryn Bonney E-Mail: Kathryn.Bonney@census.gov  Cory L.

"JOUR","Wildfire activity has increased in the US and is projected to accelerate under future climate change. However, our understanding of the impacts of climate change on wildfire smoke and health remains highly uncertain. We quantify the past and future mortality burden in the US due to wildfire smoke fine particulate matter (PM2.5). We construct an ensemble of statistical and machine learning models that link variation in climate to wildfire smoke PM2.5, and empirically estimate smoke PM2.5-mortality relationships using georeferenced data on all recorded deaths in the US from 2006 to 2019. We project that climate-driven increases in future smoke PM2.5 could result in 27,800 excess deaths per year by 2050 under a high warming scenario, a 76% increase relative to estimated 2011-2020 averages. Cumulative excess deaths from wildfire smoke PM2.5 could exceed 700,000 between 2025-2055. When monetized, climate-induced smoke deaths result in annual damages of $244 billion by mid-century, comparable to the estimated sum of all other damages in the US in prior analyses. Our research suggests that the health cost of climate-driven wildfire smoke could be among the most important and costly consequences of a warming climate in the US.","B","mortality burden from wildfire smoke under climate change","burke, marshall","10.3386/w32307","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w32307.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Minghao Qiu E-Mail: mhqiu@stanford.edu  Jessica Li Department of Economics University of California, San Diego 9500 Gilman Dr. #0508  Mail Code: 0508  La Jolla, CA 92093 E-Mail: jel142@ucsd.edu  Carlos F.

"JOUR","We measure the nature and severity of a variety of belief distortions in market reactions to hundreds of economic news events using a new methodology that synthesizes estimation of a structural asset pricing model with algorithmic machine learning to quantify bias. We estimate that investors systematically overreact to perceptions about multiple fundamental shocks in a macro-dynamic system, generating asymmetric compositional effects when several counteracting shocks occur simultaneously in real-world events.

"JOUR","We argue that comprehensive out-of-sample (OOS) evaluation using statistical decision theory (SDT) should replace the current practice of K-fold and Common Task Framework validation in machine learning (ML) research. SDT provides a formal framework for performing comprehensive OOS evaluation across all possible (1) training samples, (2) populations that may generate training data, and (3) populations of prediction interest. Regarding feature (3), we emphasize that SDT requires the practitioner to directly confront the possibility that the future may not look like the past and to account for a possible need to extrapolate from one population to another when building a predictive algorithm. SDT is simple in abstraction, but it is often computationally demanding to implement. We discuss progress in tractable implementation of SDT when prediction accuracy is measured by mean square error or by misclassification rate. We summarize research studying settings in which the training data will be generated from a subpopulation of the population of prediction interest. We consider conditional prediction with alternative restrictions on the state space of possible populations that may generate training data. We present an illustrative application of the methodology to the problem of predicting patient illness to inform clinical decision making. We conclude by calling on ML researchers to join with econometricians and statisticians in expanding the domain within which implementation of SDT is tractable.","B","comprehensive oos evaluation of predictive algorithms with statistical decision theory","manski, charles f","10.3386/w32269","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w32269.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Jeff Dominitz E-Mail: dominitz-jeff@norc.org  Charles F.

"JOUR","This paper uses a large language model to develop an ex-ante measure of the commercial potential of scientific findings. In addition to validating the measure against the typical holdout sample, we validate it externally against 1.) the progression of scientific findings through a major university’s technology transfer process and 2.) firms’ use of the academic science of major American research universities. We then illustrate the measure’s utility by applying it to two questions. First, does the patenting of academic research by universities impede its breadth of use by firms? Second, to illustrate how this measure can advance our understanding of the determinants of firms’ use of science generally, we use it to analyze how one factor, universities’ reputations for generating commercializable science, impacts firms’ use of academic science. For the former question, using our measure to control for commercializable science, we find that patenting does not dampen the dissemination of academic science in industry. For the second, we find that reputation per se, apart from the production of commercializable science, impacts industry’s use of science, especially for that science with high commercial potential, implying that the commercializable science of less prominent universities is disproportionately overlooked by industry.","B","measuring the commercial potential of science","cohen, wesley m","10.3386/w32262","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w32262.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Roger Masclans E-Mail: roger.masclans@duke.edu  Sharique Hasan Duke University  Fuqua School of Business Box 90120 Durham, NC   27708-0120 E-Mail: sh424@duke.edu  Wesley M.

"JOUR","We analyze how output and wages behave under different scenarios for technological progress that may culminate in Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), defined as the ability of AI systems to perform all tasks that humans can perform. We assume that human work can be decomposed into atomistic tasks that differ in their complexity. Advances in technology make ever more complex tasks amenable to automation. The effects on wages depend on a race between automation and capital accumulation. If automation proceeds sufficiently slowly, then there is always enough work for humans, and wages may rise forever. By contrast, if the complexity of tasks that humans can perform is bounded and full automation is reached, then wages collapse. But declines may occur even before if large-scale automation outpaces capital accumulation and makes labor too abundant. Automating productivity growth may lead to broad-based gains in the returns to all factors. By contrast, bottlenecks to growth from irreproducible scarce factors may exacerbate the decline in wages.","A","scenarios for the transition to agi","suh, donghyun","10.3386/w32255","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w32255.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Anton Korinek Department of Economics University of Virginia Monroe Hall 246 248 McCormick Rd Charlottesville, VA 22904 E-Mail: anton@korinek.com  Donghyun Suh E-Mail: ds2qzc@virginia.edu",2024,"http://www.nber.org/papers/w32255","No. 32255","Mar-24",NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE
"JOUR","Why are certain movies more successful in some markets than others? Are the entertainment products we consume reflective of our core values and beliefs? These questions drive our investigation into the relationship between a society’s oral tradition and the financial success of films. We combine a unique catalog of local tales, myths, and legends around the world with data on international movie screenings and revenues. First, we quantify the similarity between movies’ plots and traditional motifs employing machine learning techniques. Comparing the same movie across different markets, we establish that films that resonate more with local folklore systematically accrue higher revenue and are more likely to be screened. Second, we document analogous patterns within the US. Google Trends data reveal a pronounced interest in markets where ancestral narratives align more closely with a movie’s theme. Third, we delve into the explicit values transmitted by films, concentrating on the depiction of risk and gender roles. Films that promote risk-taking sell more in entrepreneurial societies today, rooted in traditions where characters pursue dangerous tasks successfully. Films portraying women in stereotypical roles continue to find a robust audience in societies with similar gender stereotypes in their folklore and where women today continue being relegated to subordinate positions. These findings underscore the enduring influence of traditional storytelling on entertainment patterns in the 21st century, highlighting a profound connection between movie consumption and deeply ingrained cultural narratives and values.","B","movies","rauh, christopher","10.3386/w32220","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w32220.pdf",NA,NA,"presented at ""Economics of Culture and Institutions"", April 20, 2024","Author contact info: Stelios Michalopoulos Brown University Department of Economics 64 Waterman Street Providence, RI 02912 Tel: 401/863-2506 Fax: 401/863-1970 E-Mail: smichalo@brown.edu  Christopher Rauh University of Cambridge Cambridge United Kingdom E-Mail: cr542@cam.ac.uk",2024,"http://www.nber.org/papers/w32220","No. 32220","Mar-24",NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE
"JOUR","This paper studies how and why households adjust their spending, saving, and borrowing in response to transitory income shocks. We leverage new large-scale survey data to first quantitatively assess households’ intertemporal marginal propensities to consume (MPCs) and deleverage (MPDs) (the “how”), and second to dive into the motivations and decision-making processes across households (the “why”). The combination of the quantitative estimation of household response dynamics with a qualitative exploration of the mental models employed during financial decisions provides a more complete view of household behavior. Our findings are as follows: First, we validate the reliability of surveys in predicting actual economic behaviors using a new approach called cross-validation, which compares the responses to hypothetical financial scenarios with observed actions from past studies. Participants’ predicted reactions closely align with real-life behaviors. Second, we show that MPCs are significantly higher immediately following an income shock and diminish over time, with cumulative MPCs over a year showing significant variability. However, MPDs play a critical role in household financial adjustments and display significantly more cross-sectional heterogeneity. Neither is easily explained by socioeconomic or financial characteristics alone, and the explanatory power is improved by adding psychological factors, past experiences, and expectations. Third, using specifically-designed survey questions, we find that there is a broad range of motivations behind households’ financial decisions and identify four household types using machine learning: Strongly Constrained, Precautionary, Quasi-Smoothers, and Spenders. Similar financial actions stem from diverse reasons, challenging the predictability of financial behavior solely based on socioeconomic and financial characteristics. Finally, we use our findings to address some puzzles in household finance.","B","the how and why of household reactions to income shocks","stantcheva, stefanie","10.3386/w32191","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w32191.pdf",NA,NA,"presented at ""SI 2024 Behavioral Macro"", July 19, 2024","Author contact info: Roberto Colarieti E-Mail: robertocolarieti@fas.harvard.edu  Pierfrancesco Mei Department of Economics Littauer Center G7 Harvard University Cambridge, MA 02138 E-Mail: pierfrancescomei@g.harvard.edu  Stefanie Stantcheva Department of Economics Littauer Center 232 Harvard University Cambridge, MA  02138 Tel: 617-496-2614 E-Mail: sstantcheva@fas.harvard.edu",2024,"http://www.nber.org/papers/w32191","No. 32191","Mar-24",NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE

We establish identification of the outcome equation parameters and the distribution of the three types of unobservables, under the standard assumption that unknown heterogeneity and uncertainty are normally distributed. We also show that, absent known heterogeneity, the model is identified without making any distributional assumption. We then derive the asymptotic properties of a sieve MLE estimator for the model parameters, and devise a tractable profile likelihood based estimation procedure.

"JOUR","Do environmental conditions pose greater health risks to individuals living in urban or rural areas? The answer is theoretically ambiguous: while urban areas have traditionally been associated with heightened exposure to environmental pollutants, the economies of scale and density inherent to urban environments offer unique opportunities for mitigating or adapting to these harmful exposures. To make progress on this question, we focus on the United States and consider how exposures—to air pollution, drinking water pollution, and extreme temperatures—and the response to those exposures differ across urban and rural settings. While prior studies have addressed some aspects of these issues, substantial gaps in knowledge remain, in large part due to historical deficiencies in monitoring and reporting, especially in rural areas. As a step toward closing these gaps, we present new evidence on urban-rural differences in air quality and population sensitivity to air pollution, leveraging recent advances in remote sensing measurement and machine learning. We find that the urban-rural gap in fine particulate matter (PM₂.₅) has converged over the last two decades and the remaining gap is small relative to the overall declines. Furthermore, we find that residents of urban counties are, on average, less vulnerable to the mortality effects of PM₂.₅ exposure. We also discuss promising areas for future research.","B","do cities mitigate or exacerbate environmental damages to health?","white, corey d","10.3386/w31990","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w31990.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: David Molitor University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign 340 Wohlers Hall 1206 S.

"JOUR","The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and of cross-border restrictions on data flows has created a host of new questions and related policy dilemmas. This paper addresses two questions: How is digital service trade shaped by (1) AI algorithms and (2) by the interplay between AI algorithms and cross-border restrictions on data flows? Answers lie in the palm of your hand: From London to Lagos, mobile app users trigger international transactions when they open AI-powered foreign apps. We have 2015-2020 usage data for the most popular 35,575 mobile apps and, to quantify the AI deployed in each of these apps, we use a large language model (LLM) to link each app to each of the app developer's AI patents. (This linkage of specific products to specific patents is a methodological innovation.) Armed with data on app usage by country, with AI deployed in each app, and with an instrument for AI (a Heckscher-Ohlin cost-shifter), we answer our two questions. (1) On average, AI causally raises an app's number of foreign users by 2.67 log points or by more than 10-fold.  (2) The impact of AI on foreign users is halved if the foreign users are in a country with strong restrictions on cross-border data flows.  These countries are usually autocracies. We also provide a new way of measuring AI knowledge spillovers across firms and find large spillovers. Finally, our work suggests numerous ways in which LLMs such as ChatGPT can be used in other applications.","A","the impact of ai and cross-border data regulation on international trade in digital services: a large language model","trefler, daniel","10.3386/w31925","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w31925.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Ruiqi Sun Rotman School of Management  105 St. George Street Toronto, ON M5S3E6 Canada Tel: 4379890196 E-Mail: sunrq.17@pbcsf.tsinghua.edu.cn  Daniel Trefler Rotman School of Management University of Toronto 105 St. George Street Toronto, ON M5S 3E6 Tel: 416/946-7945 Fax: 416/978-5433 E-Mail: dtrefler@rotman.utoronto.ca",2023,"http://www.nber.org/papers/w31925","No. 31925","Nov-23",NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE

"JOUR","Efforts to document long-term trends in socioeconomic mobility in the United States have been hindered by the lack of large, representative datasets that include information linking parents to their adult children. This problem has been especially acute for women, who are more difficult to link because their surnames often change between childhood and adulthood. In this paper, we use a new dataset, the Census Tree, that overcomes these issues by building on information from an online genealogy platform. Users of the platform have private information that allows them to create links among the 1850 to 1940 decennial censuses; the Census Tree combines these links with others obtained using machine learning and traditional linking methods to produce a dataset with hundreds of millions of census-to-census links, nearly half of which are for women. With these data, we produce estimates of the intergenerational transmission of socioeconomic status from fathers to their sons and daughters. We find that for married men and women, the patterns of mobility over this period are remarkably similar. Single women, however, are less mobile than their male counterparts. We also present new estimates that show that assortative mating was much stronger than previously estimated for the US.","B","family trees and falling apples: historical intergenerational mobility estimates for women and men","wilbert, haley e.b.","10.3386/w31918","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w31918.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Kasey Buckles University of Notre Dame Department of Economics 3052 Jenkins-Nanovic Halls Notre Dame, IN 46556 E-Mail: kbuckles@nd.edu  Joseph Price Department of Economics Brigham Young University 2129 WVB Provo, UT 84602 Tel: 801/422-5296 Fax: 801/422-0194 E-Mail: joseph_price@byu.edu  Zachary Ward Department of Economics Baylor University One Bear Place Waco, TX 76798 E-Mail: zach.a.ward@gmail.com  Haley E.B.

"JOUR","We study the effects of job-protected leave policies on intergenerational mobility, long-run child outcomes, and parental decisions (labor market, investments in children, and fertility). We merge rich sources of historical information on family leave policies across the United States since 1973 with over 40 years of survey data covering two generations of individuals. Exploiting variation in the timing of job-protected leave policies introduced in a large set of 18 states and the District of Columbia before the enactment of the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) in 1993, we find that the pre-FMLA protected leave policies had a level effect and a mobility effect. The level effect yields from overall improvements in education and wages for the children born under these policies. The mobility effect, chiefly an increase in intergenerational mobility in education, stems from heterogeneity in the effects of the policies: children of mothers with fewer years of education benefit more. As a potential mechanism, we find that the policies increased mothers’ time investments in children and the likelihood of the households having childcare expenses. Finally, consistent with the tradeoffs of policy design, we find that the policies exacerbated the motherhood penalty in labor market outcomes and that they affected fertility choices, increasing the likelihood of having a first child and decreasing the likelihood of having subsequent children.","B","the intergenerational effects of parental leave: exploiting forty years of u.s. policy variation","hincapié, andrés","10.3386/w31911","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w31911.pdf",NA,NA,"presented at ""Labor Studies Program Meeting"", November 10, 2023","Author contact info: Andrea M.

"JOUR","We develop measures of labor-saving and labor-augmenting technology exposure using textual analysis of patents and job tasks. Using US administrative data, we show that both measures negatively predict earnings growth of individual incumbent workers. While labor-saving technologies predict earnings declines and higher likelihood of job loss for all workers, labor-augmenting technologies primarily predict losses for older or highly-paid workers.

"JOUR","Industrialized countries have long seen relatively stable growth in output per capita and a stable labor share. AI may be transformative, in the sense that it may break one or both of these stylized facts. This review outlines the ways this may happen by placing several strands of the literature on AI and growth within a common framework. We first evaluate models in which AI increases output production, for example via increases in capital's substitutability for labor or task automation, capturing the notion that AI will let capital “self-replicate”. This typically speeds up growth and lowers the labor share. We then consider models in which AI increases knowledge production, capturing the notion that AI will let capital “self-improve”, speeding growth further. Taken as a whole, the literature suggests that sufficiently advanced AI is likely to deliver both effects.","A","economic growth under transformative ai","korinek, anton","10.3386/w31815","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w31815.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Philip Trammell Department of Economics University of Oxford 10 Manor Rd Oxford, Oxfordshire United Kingdom E-Mail: pawtrammell@gmail.com  Anton Korinek Department of Economics University of Virginia Monroe Hall 246 248 McCormick Rd Charlottesville, VA 22904 E-Mail: anton@korinek.com",2023,"http://www.nber.org/papers/w31815","No. 31815","Oct-23",NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE
"JOUR","Motivated by a recent literature on the double-descent phenomenon in machine learning, we consider highly over-parameterized models in causal inference, including synthetic control with many control units. In such models, there may be so many free parameters that the model fits the training data perfectly. We first investigate high-dimensional linear regression for imputing wage data and estimating average treatment effects, where we find that models with many more covariates than sample size can outperform simple ones. We then document the performance of high-dimensional synthetic control estimators with many control units. We find that adding control units can help improve imputation performance even beyond the point where the pre-treatment fit is perfect. We provide a unified theoretical perspective on the performance of these high-dimensional models. Specifically, we show that more complex models can be interpreted as model-averaging estimators over simpler ones, which we link to an improvement in average performance. This perspective yields concrete insights into the use of synthetic control when control units are many relative to the number of pre-treatment periods.","B","double and single descent in causal inference with an application to high-dimensional synthetic control","venugopal, amar","10.3386/w31802","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w31802.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Jann Spiess Stanford Graduate School of Business 655 Knight Way Stanford, CA 94305 United States Tel: 8572849880 E-Mail: jspiess@stanford.edu  Guido Imbens Graduate School of Business Stanford University 655 Knight Way Stanford, CA 94305 E-Mail: Imbens@stanford.edu  Amar Venugopal E-Mail: amarvenu@stanford.edu",2023,"http://www.nber.org/papers/w31802","No. 31802","Oct-23",NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE
"JOUR","We study the early adoption and diffusion of five AI-related technologies (automated-guided vehicles, machine learning, machine vision, natural language processing, and voice recognition) as documented in the 2018 Annual Business Survey of 850,000 firms across the United States. We find that fewer than 6% of firms used any of the AI-related technologies we measure, though most very large firms reported at least some AI use. Weighted by employment, average adoption was just over 18%. AI use in production, while varying considerably by industry, nevertheless was found in every sector of the economy and clustered with emerging technologies such as cloud computing and robotics. Among dynamic young firms, AI use was highest alongside more-educated, more-experienced, and younger owners, including owners motivated by bringing new ideas to market or helping the community. AI adoption was also more common alongside indicators of high-growth entrepreneurship, including venture capital funding, recent product and process innovation, and growth-oriented business strategies. Early adoption was far from evenly distributed: a handful of “superstar” cities and emerging hubs led startups’ adoption of AI. These patterns of early AI use foreshadow economic and social impacts far beyond this limited initial diffusion, with the possibility of a growing “AI divide” if early patterns persist.","A","ai adoption in america: who, what, and where","zolas, nikolas","10.3386/w31788","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w31788.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Kristina McElheran University of Toronto Scarborough 105 St. George Street Toronto, ON M5S 3E6 E-Mail: k.mcelheran@utoronto.ca  J.

"JOUR","We ask whether a technical objective of using human performance of tasks as a benchmark for AI performance will result in the negative outcomes highlighted in prior work in terms of jobs and inequality. Instead, we argue that task automation, especially when driven by AI advances, can enhance job prospects and potentially widen the scope for employment of many workers. The neglected mechanism we highlight is the potential for changes in the skill premium where AI automation of tasks exogenously improves the value of the skills of many workers, expands the pool of available workers to perform other tasks, and, in the process, increases labor income and potentially reduces inequality. We label this possibility the “Turing Transformation.” As such, we argue that AI researchers and policymakers should not focus on the technical aspects of AI applications and whether they are directed at automating human-performed tasks or not and, instead, focus on the outcomes of AI research. In so doing, our goal is not to diminish human-centric AI research as a laudable goal. Instead, we want to note that AI research that uses a human-task template with a goal to automate that task can often augment human performance of other tasks and whole jobs. The distributional effects of technology depend more on which workers have tasks that get automated than on the fact of automation per se.","B","the turing transformation: artificial intelligence, intelligence augmentation, and skill premiums","goldfarb, avi","10.3386/w31767","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w31767.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Ajay K.

"JOUR","Do non-traditional digital trace data and traditional survey data yield similar estimates of the impact of a cash transfer program? In a randomized controlled trial of Togo’s COVID-19 Novissi program, endline survey data indicate positive treatment effects on beneficiary food security, mental health, and self-perceived economic status. However, impact estimates based on mobile phone data – processed with machine learning to predict beneficiary welfare – do not yield similar results, even though related data and methods do accurately predict wealth and consumption in prior cross-sectional analysis in Togo. This limitation likely arises from the underlying difficulty of using mobile phone data to predict short-term changes in wellbeing within a rural population with fairly homogeneous baseline levels of poverty.

It is substantially more likely to export surveillance AI than other countries, and particularly so as compared to other frontier technologies. Second, autocracies and weak democracies are more likely to import surveillance AI from China. This bias is not observed in AI imports from the US or in imports of other frontier technologies from China. Third, autocracies and weak democracies are especially more likely to import China’s surveillance AI in years of domestic unrest. Such imports coincide with declines in domestic institutional quality more broadly. To the extent that China may be exporting its surveillance state via trade in AI, this can enhance and beget more autocracies abroad.

"JOUR","The Census Tree is the largest-ever database of record links among the historical U.S. censuses, with over 700 million links for people living in the United States between 1850 and 1940.

We model innovation as resulting from sequential search over a combinatorial design space, where the prioritization of costly tests is achieved using a predictive model. We represent the ranked output of the predictive model in the form of a hazard function. We then use discrete survival analysis to obtain the main innovation outcomes of interest – the probability of innovation, expected search duration, and expected profit. We describe conditions under which shifting from the traditional method of hypothesis generation, using theory or intuition, to instead using AI that generates higher fidelity predictions, results in a higher likelihood of successful innovation, shorter search durations, and higher expected profits.

"JOUR","This paper studies the impact of adult prosecution on recidivism and employment trajectories for adolescent, first-time felony defendants. We use extensive linked Criminal Justice Admin- istrative Record System and socio-economic data from Wayne County, Michigan (Detroit). Using the discrete age of majority rule and a regression discontinuity design, we find that adult prosecution reduces future criminal charges over 5 years by 0.48 felony cases (↓ 20%) while also worsening labor market outcomes: 0.76 fewer employers (↓ 19%) and $674 fewer earnings (↓ 21%) per year. We develop a novel econometric framework that combines standard regression discontinuity methods with predictive machine learning models to identify mechanism-specific treatment effects that underpin the overall impact of adult prosecution. We leverage these estimates to consider four policy counterfactuals: (1) raising the age of majority, (2) increasing adult dismissals to match the juvenile disposition rates, (3) eliminating adult incarceration, and (4) expanding juvenile record sealing opportunities to teenage adult defendants. All four scenarios generate positive returns for government budgets. When accounting for impacts to defendants as well as victim costs borne by society stemming from increases in recidivism, we find positive social returns for juvenile record sealing expansions and dismissing marginal adult charges; raising the age of majority breaks even. Eliminating prison for first-time adult felony defendants, however, increases net social costs. Policymakers may still find this attractive if they are willing to value beneficiaries (taxpayers and defendants) slightly higher (124%) than potential victims.","B","estimating the impact of the age of criminal majority: decomposing multiple treatments in a regression discontinuity framework","walker, caroline","10.3386/w31523","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w31523.pdf",NA,NA,"presented at ""Program on Children Meeting"", March 2-3, 2023","Author contact info: Michael G.

"JOUR","Transformative technologies like generative artificial intelligence promise to accelerate productivity growth across many sectors, but they also present new risks from potential misuse. We develop a multi-sector technology adoption model to study the optimal regulation of transformative technologies when society can learn about these risks over time. Socially optimal adoption is gradual and convex. If social damages are proportional to the productivity gains from the new technology, a higher growth rate leads to slower optimal adoption. Equilibrium adoption is inefficient when firms do not internalize all social damages, and sector-independent regulation is helpful but generally not sufficient to restore optimality.",NA,"regulating transformative technologies","lensman, todd","10.3386/w31461","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w31461.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Daron Acemoglu Department of Economics, E52-446 Massachusetts Institute of Technology 77 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02139 Tel: 617/253-1927 Fax: 617/253-1330 E-Mail: daron@mit.edu  Todd Lensman Department of Economics Massachusetts Institute of Technology 77 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02139 E-Mail: tlensman@mit.edu",2023,"http://www.nber.org/papers/w31461","No. 31461","Jul-23",NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE

Radiologists do not realize the gains from AI assistance because of errors in belief updating – they underweight AI predictions and treat their own information and AI predictions as statistically independent.

"JOUR","We nowcast world trade using machine learning, distinguishing between tree-based methods (random forest, gradient boosting) and their regression-based counterparts (macroeconomic random forest, gradient linear boosting). While much less used in the literature, the latter are found to outperform not only the tree-based techniques, but also more “traditional” linear and non-linear techniques (OLS, Markov-switching, quantile regression). They do so significantly and consistently across different horizons and real-time datasets. To further improve performances when forecasting with machine learning, we propose a flexible three-step approach composed of (step 1) pre-selection, (step 2) factor extraction and (step 3) machine learning regression. We find that both pre-selection and factor extraction significantly improve the accuracy of machine-learning-based predictions. This three-step approach also outperforms workhorse benchmarks, such as a PCA-OLS model, an elastic net, or a dynamic factor model. Finally, on top of high accuracy, the approach is flexible and can be extended seamlessly beyond world trade.","B","nowcasting world trade with machine learning: a three-step approach","stumpner, sebastian","10.3386/w31419","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w31419.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Menzie D.

"JOUR","We examine the link between labour market developments and new technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and software in 16 European countries over the period 2011- 2019. Using data for occupations at the 3-digit level in Europe, we find that on average employment shares have increased in occupations more exposed to AI. This is particularly the case for occupations with a relatively higher proportion of younger and skilled workers. This evidence is in line with the Skill Biased Technological Change theory. While there exists heterogeneity across countries, only very few countries show a decline in employment shares of occupations more exposed to AI-enabled automation. Country heterogeneity for this result seems to be linked to the pace of technology diffusion and education, but also to the level of product market regulation (competition) and employment protection laws. In contrast to the findings for employment, we find little evidence for a relationship between wages and potential exposures to new technologies.","A","new technologies and jobs in europe","wabitsch, alena","10.3386/w31357","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w31357.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Stefania Albanesi Miami Herbert Business School University of Miami 5250 University Drive Coral Gables, FL 33146 E-Mail: stefania.albanesi@gmail.com  António Dias da Silva E-Mail: Antonio.Dias_Da_Silva@ecb.europa.eu  Juan F.

To do so, we leverage a unique combination of worker resume and job postings datasets to measure firm-level AI investments and workforce composition variables, such as educational attainment, specialization, and hierarchy. We document that firms with higher initial shares of highly-educated workers and STEM workers invest more in AI. As firms invest in AI, they tend to transition to more educated workforces, with higher shares of workers with undergraduate and graduate degrees, and more specialization in STEM fields and IT skills. Furthermore, AI investments are associated with a flattening of the firms' hierarchical structure, with significant increases in the share of workers at the junior level and decreases in shares of workers in middle-management and senior roles. Overall, our results highlight that adoption of AI technologies is associated with significant reorganization of firms' workforces.","A","firm investments in artificial intelligence technologies and changes in workforce composition","hodson, james","10.3386/w31325","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w31325.pdf","published as Tania Babina, Anastassia Fedyk, Alex X.

The procedure uses state-of-the-art approaches from hedonic econometrics and implements them with a neural network ML approach. Applying the methodology to Nielsen Retail Scanner data leads to a large hedonic adjustment to the Tornqvist index for food product groups: Cumulative food inflation over the period from 2007 through 2015 is reduced by half from 5.9% to 2.8% -- owing to quality adjustment.

"JOUR","This article presents a comprehensive analysis of trends in the publication and citation of economics scholarly research, with a focus on specialization within fields of economics research (i.e., applied, applied theory, econometrics methods, and theory). We collected detailed data on 24,273 articles published from 1970 to 2016 in highly regarded general research economics journals. We then used state-of-the-art machine learning and natural language processing techniques to further enrich the collected data. Our findings reveal significant disparities in article content and citations across fields of economics research. The analysis indicates growing specialization trends in theory and econometric methods. In contrast, applied papers are covering a wider range of topics and receiving an increasing proportion of extramural citations over time. By 2016, applied ranked among the most or second most cited field by any other field of economics research. These patterns are consistent with applied papers becoming more multidisciplinary. Applied theory articles have also demonstrated a growing breadth of topics covered (similar to applied articles); however, this has not been accompanied by an increase in extramural citations or in the share of citations received from other fields of economics research (as observed with theory articles). This makes it challenging to determine their specialization status.","B","unveiling specialization trends in economics research: a large-scale study using natural language processing and citation analysis","nachman, ian","10.3386/w31295","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w31295.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Sebastian Galiani Department of Economics University of Maryland 3105 Tydings Hall College Park, MD 20742 Tel: 301/405-3518 E-Mail: sgaliani@umd.edu  Ramiro H.

"JOUR","This paper studies how household inequality shapes the effects of the zero lower bound (ZLB) on nominal interest rates on aggregate dynamics. To do so, we consider a heterogeneous agent New Keynesian (HANK) model with an occasionally binding ZLB and solve for its fully non-linear stochastic equilibrium using a novel neural network algorithm. In this setting, changes in the monetary policy stance influence households' precautionary savings by altering the frequency of ZLB events. As a result, the model features monetary policy non-neutrality in the long run. The degree of long-run non-neutrality, i.e., by how much monetary policy shifts real rates in the ergodic distribution of the model, can be substantial when we combine low inflation targets and high levels of wealth inequality.","B","inequality and the zero lower bound","rachedi, omar","10.3386/w31282","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w31282.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Jesús Fernández-Villaverde Department of Economics University of Pennsylvania The Ronald O.

"JOUR","National industrial concentration in the U.S. has risen sharply since the early 1980s, but there remains dispute over whether local geographic concentration has followed a similar trend. Using near population data from the Economic Censuses, we confirm and extend existing evidence on national U.S. industrial concentration while providing novel evidence on local concentration. We document that the Herfindhahl index of local employment concentration, measured at the county-by-NAICS six-digit-industry cell level, fell between 1992 and 2017 even as local sales concentration rose. The divergence between national and local employment concentration trends is attributable to the structural transformation of U.S. economic activity: both sales and employment concentration rose within industry-by-county cells; but reallocation of sales and employment from relatively concentrated Manufacturing industries (e.g., steel mills) towards relatively un-concentrated Service industries (e.g. hair salons) reduced local concentration. A stronger between-sector shift in employment relative to sales drove the net fall in local employment concentration. Holding industry employment shares at their 1992 level, average local employment concentration would have risen by about 9% by 2017. Instead, it fell by 5%. Falling local employment concentration may intensify competition for recent market entrants. Simultaneously, rising within industry-by-geography concentration may weaken competition for incumbent workers who have limited sectoral mobility. To facilitate analysis, we have made data on these trends available for download.","B","local and national concentration trends in jobs and sales: the role of structural transformation","van reenen, john","10.3386/w31130","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w31130.pdf",NA,NA,"presented at ""SI 2023 Conference on Research in Income and Wealth"", July 17-18, 2023","Author contact info: David Autor Department of Economics, E52-438 Massachusetts Institute of Technology 77 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02139 Tel: 617/258-7698 Fax: 617/253-1330 E-Mail: dautor@mit.edu  Christina Patterson Booth School of Business University of Chicago 5807 S.

"JOUR","The United Nations Human Development Index (HDI) is arguably the most widely used alternative to gross domestic product for measuring national development. This is in large part due to its multidimensional nature, as it incorporates not only income, but also education and health. However, the low country-level resolution of the global HDI data released by the Human Development Report Office of the United Nations Development Programme (N=191 countries) has limited its use at the local level. Recent efforts used labor-intensive survey data to produce HDI estimates for first-level administrative units (e.g., states/provinces). Here, we build on recent advances in machine learning and satellite imagery to develop the first global estimates of HDI for second-level administrative units (e.g., municipalities/counties, N = 61,591) and for a global 0.1 × 0.1 degree grid (N=806,361). To accomplish this we develop and validate a generalizable downscaling technique based on satellite imagery that allows for training and prediction with observations of arbitrary shape and size. This enables us to train a model using provincial administrative data and generate HDI estimates at the municipality and grid levels. Our results indicate that more than half of the global population was previously assigned to the incorrect HDI quintile within each country, due to aggregation bias resulting from lower resolution estimates. We also illustrate how these data can improve decision-making.

"JOUR","While hypothesis testing is a highly formalized activity, hypothesis generation remains largely informal. We propose a systematic procedure to generate novel hypotheses about human behavior, which uses the capacity of machine learning algorithms to notice patterns people might not. We illustrate the procedure with a concrete application: judge decisions about who to jail. We begin with a striking fact: The defendant’s face alone matters greatly for the judge’s jailing decision. In fact, an algorithm given only the pixels in the defendant’s mugshot accounts for up to half of the predictable variation. We develop a procedure that allows human subjects to interact with this black-box algorithm to produce hypotheses about what in the face influences judge decisions. The procedure generates hypotheses that are both interpretable and novel: They are not explained by demographics (e.g. race) or existing psychology research; nor are they already known (even if tacitly) to people or even experts. Though these results are specific, our procedure is general. It provides a way to produce novel, interpretable hypotheses from any high-dimensional dataset (e.g. cell phones, satellites, online behavior, news headlines, corporate filings, and high-frequency time series). A central tenet of our paper is that hypothesis generation is in and of itself a valuable activity, and hope this encourages future work in this largely “pre-scientific” stage of science.","B","machine learning as a tool for hypothesis generation","mullainathan, sendhil","10.3386/w31017","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w31017.pdf",NA,NA,"presented at ""Economics of Artificial Intelligence Conference"", September 22, 2023","Author contact info: Jens Ludwig Harris School of Public Policy University of Chicago 1307 East 60th Street Chicago, IL 60637 Tel: 773/834-0811 E-Mail: jludwig@uchicago.edu  Sendhil Mullainathan Booth School of Business University of Chicago 5807 South Woodlawn Avenue Chicago, IL 60637 Tel: 773/834-2353 E-Mail: sendhil.mullainathan@gmail.com",2023,"http://www.nber.org/papers/w31017","No. 31017","Mar-23",NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE
"JOUR","Economic models provide little insight into when the next big idea and its associated productivity dividend will come along. Once a general purpose technology (GPT) is identified, the economist’s toolkit does provide an understanding when firms will adopt a new technology and for what purpose. The focus of the literature has been on commonalities across each type of GPT. This focus is natural, given that the goal of the literature has been to identify generalizable insights across technologies. Broadly, this literature emphasizes heterogeneity in co-invention costs across firms. Each GPT, however, provides a distinct benefit. Steam provided a new power source. The internet facilitated communication. The differences between GPTs are important for understanding adoption patterns. Using the examples of the internet and artificial intelligence, we discuss how both co-invention costs and distinct benefits determine the adoption of technology. For both technologies, we demonstrate that discussions of the impact of a GPT on productivity and growth need to emphasize the benefits as well as the costs. The goal of this paper is therefore to link the literature on co-invention costs with an understanding of the distinct benefits of each GPT.","A","similarities and differences in the adoption of general purpose technologies","goldfarb, avi","10.3386/w30976","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w30976.pdf","published as Ajay Agrawal, Joshua S.

"JOUR","The US spends more than 4 trillion dollars per year on health care, largely conducted by private providers and reimbursed by insurers. A major concern in this system is overbilling, waste and fraud by providers, who face incentives to misreport on their claims in order to receive higher payments. In this work, we develop novel machine learning tools to identify providers that overbill insurers. Using large-scale claims data from Medicare, the US federal health insurance program for elderly adults and the disabled, we identify patterns consistent with fraud or overbilling among inpatient hospitalizations. Our proposed approach for fraud detection is fully unsupervised, not relying on any labeled training data, and is explainable to end users, providing reasoning and interpretable insights into the potentially suspicious behavior of the flagged providers. Data from the Department of Justice on providers facing anti-fraud lawsuits and case studies of suspicious providers validate our approach and findings. We also perform a post-analysis to understand hospital characteristics, those not used for detection but associate with a high suspiciousness score. Our method provides an 8-fold lift over random targeting, and can be used to guide investigations and auditing of suspicious providers for both public and private health insurance systems.","A","unsupervised machine learning for explainable health care fraud detection","akoglu, leman","10.3386/w30946","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w30946.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Shubhranshu Shekhar 415 South St Waltham, MA 02453 United States Tel: 4126260424 E-Mail: sshekhar@brandeis.edu  Jetson Leder-Luis Questrom School of Business Boston University 595 Commonwealth Avenue Boston, MA 02215 Tel: 914/844-9457 E-Mail: jetson@bu.edu  Leman Akoglu 2118C Hamburg Hall Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA E-Mail: lakoglu@andrew.cmu.edu",2023,"http://www.nber.org/papers/w30946","No. 30946","Feb-23",NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE
"JOUR","Remotely sensed measurements and other machine learning predictions are increasingly used in place of direct observations in empirical analyses. Errors in such measures may bias parameter estimation, but it remains unclear how large such biases are or how to correct for them. We leverage a new benchmark dataset providing co-located ground truth observations and remotely sensed measurements for multiple variables across the contiguous U.S. to show that the common practice of using remotely sensed measurements without correction leads to biased parameter point estimates and standard errors across a diversity of empirical settings. More than three-quarters of the 95% confidence intervals we estimate using remotely sensed measurements do not contain the true coefficient of interest. These biases result from both classical measurement error and more structured measurement error, which we find is common in machine learning based remotely sensed measurements. We show that multiple imputation, a standard statistical imputation technique so far untested in this setting, effectively reduces bias and improves statistical coverage with only minor reductions in power in both simple linear regression and panel fixed effects frameworks. Our results demonstrate that multiple imputation is a generalizable and easily implementable method for correcting parameter estimates relying on remotely sensed variables.","B","parameter recovery using remotely sensed variables","sum, sandy","10.3386/w30861","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w30861.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Jonathan Proctor Harvard Center for the Environment 26 Oxford Street, 4th floor Cambridge, MA 02138 E-Mail: jproctor1@fas.harvard.edu  Tamma Carleton Bren School of Environmental Science & Management University of California, Santa Barbara Santa Barbara, CA 93106 Tel: 415/816-7870 E-Mail: tcarleton@ucsb.edu  Sandy Sum Bren School of Environmental Science  & Management University of California, Santa Barbara  Santa Barbara, CA 93106 E-Mail: sandysum@ucsb.edu",2023,"http://www.nber.org/papers/w30861","No. 30861","Jan-23",NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE

Yet healthcare lags other industries in AI adoption. In this paper, we estimate that wider adoption of AI could lead to savings of 5 to 10 percent in US healthcare spending—roughly $200 billion to $360 billion annually in 2019 dollars. These estimates are based on specific AI-enabled use cases that employ today’s technologies, are attainable within the next five years, and would not sacrifice quality or access. These opportunities could also lead to nonfinancial benefits such as improved healthcare quality, increased access, better patient experience, and greater clinician satisfaction. We further present case studies and discuss how to overcome the challenges to AI deployments.

"JOUR","Despite nearly 70 percent of the American public supporting legalization of recreational marijuana, opponents argue that increased marijuana use may diminish motivation, impede cognitive function, and harm health, each of which could adversely affect adults’ economic wellbeing. This study is the first to explore the impacts of recreational marijuana laws (RMLs) on employment and wages. Difference-in-differences estimates show little evidence that RMLs adversely affect labor market outcomes among most working-age individuals. Rather, our estimates show that RML adoption is associated with an increase in agricultural employment, consistent with the opening of a new licit market. A causal interpretation of our findings is supported by (1) event-study analyses using dynamic difference-in-differences estimates designed to expunge bias due to heterogeneous and dynamic treatment effects, and (2) alternative policy estimates generated using a synthetic control design.","B","the effects of recreational marijuana legalization on employment and earnings","sabia, joseph j","10.3386/w30813","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w30813.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Dhaval M.

To generalize security sorting and better estimate the efficient frontier, we grow a P-Tree top-down to split the cross section of asset returns to construct test assets and re-cover the stochastic discount factor under the mean-variance efficient framework, visualizing (asymmetric) nonlinear interactions among firm characteristics. When applied to U.S. equities, boosted (multi-factor) P-Trees significantly advance the efficient frontier relative to those constructed with established factors and common test assets. P-Tree test assets are diversified and exhibit significant unexplained alphas against benchmark models. The unified P-Tree factors outperform most known observable and latent factor models in pricing cross-sectional returns, delivering transparent and effective trading strategies. Beyond asset pricing, our framework offers a more interpretable and computationally efficient alternative to recent machine learning and AI models for analyzing panel data through goal-oriented, high-dimensional clustering.","B","growing the efficient frontier on panel trees","he, xin","10.3386/w30805","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w30805.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Lin William Cong SC Johnson College of Business Cornell University Sage Hall Ithaca, NY 14853 Tel: 607/255-7859 E-Mail: will.cong@cornell.edu  Guanhao Feng City University of Hong Kong 83 Tat Chee Avenue Hong Kong, China E-Mail: gavin.feng@cityu.edu.hk  Jingyu He City University of Hong Kong 83 Tat Chee Avenue Kowloon Tong Hong Kong, China E-Mail: jingyuhe@cityu.edu.hk  Xin He College of Finance and Statistics Hunan University Changsha, China E-Mail: xinh@hnu.edu.cn",2022,"http://www.nber.org/papers/w30805","No. 30805","Dec-22",NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE
"JOUR","Recent models and empirical work on network formation emphasize the importance of propinquity in producing strong interpersonal connections. Yet, one might wonder how deep such insights run, as thus far empirical results rely on survey and lab-based evidence. In this study, we examine propinquity in a high-stakes setting of talent allocation: the Major League Baseball (MLB) Draft from 2000-2019 (30,000 players were drafted from a player pool of more than a million potential draftees). Our findings can be summarized in four parts. First, propinquity is alive and well in our setting, and spans even the latter years of our sample, when higher-level statistical exercises have become the norm rather than the exception. Second, the measured effect size is consequential, as MLB clubs pay a significant opportunity cost in terms of inferior talent acquired due to propinquity bias: for example, their draft picks are 38% less likely to ever play a MLB game relative to players drafted without propinquity bias. Third, those players who benefit from propinquity bias fare better both in terms of the timing of their draft picks and their initial financial contract, conditional on draft order. Finally, the effect is found to be the most pronounced in later rounds of the draft, where the Scouting Director has the greatest latitude.","B","nothing propinks like propinquity: using machine learning to estimate the effects of spatial proximity in the major league baseball draft","vayalinkal, atom t","10.3386/w30786","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w30786.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Majid Ahmadi University of Chicago E-Mail: mahmadi@uchicago.edu  Nathan Durst E-Mail: n_durst@msn.com  Jeff Lachman E-Mail: jeffrey.lachman@gmail.com  John A.

Through a number of empirical examples, we show how ML-based regression adjustments can feasibly be implemented in practical settings. We compare our proposed estimator to other standard variance reduction techniques in the literature. Two important advantages of our ML-based regression adjustment estimator are that (i) they improve asymptotic efficiency relative to other alternatives, and (ii) they can be implemented automatically, with relatively little tuning from the researcher, which limits the scope for data-snooping.","B","using machine learning for efficient flexible regression adjustment in economic experiments","sun, gregory k","10.3386/w30756","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w30756.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: John A.

"JOUR","Wages have been spreading out across workers over time – or in other words, the 90th/50th wage ratio has risen over time. A key question is, has the productivity distribution also spread out across worker skill levels over time? Using our calculations of productivity by skill level for the U.S., we show that the distributions of both wages and productivity have spread out over time, as the right tail lengthens for both.  We add OECD countries, showing that the wage-productivity correlation exists, such that gains in aggregate productivity, or GDP per person, have resulted in higher wages for workers at the top and bottom of the wage distribution.  However, across countries, those workers in the upper income ranks have seen their wages rise the most over time. The most likely international factor explaining these wage increases is the skill-biased technological change of the digital revolution.  The new AI revolution that has just begun seems to be having a similar skill-biased effects on wages.  But this current AI, called “supervised learning,” is relatively similar to past technological change. The AI of the distant future will be “unsupervised learning,” and it could eventually have an effect on the jobs of the most highly skilled.","A","productivity and wages: what was the productivity-wage link in the digital revolution of the past, and what might occur in the ai revolution of the future?","jedras, james m","10.3386/w30734","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w30734.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Edward P.

AI has myriad applications in medicine and its adjacent industries, with AI-driven tools already in use in basic science, translational medicine, and numerous corners of health care delivery, including administrative work, diagnosis, and treatment. In diagnosis and treatment, a large and growing number of AI tools meet the statutory definition of a medical device or that of an in-vitro diagnostic. Those that do are subject to regulation by local authorities, resulting in both practical and strategic implications for manufacturers, along with a more complex set of innovation incentives. This chapter presents background on medical device regulation—especially as it relates to software products—and quantitatively describes the emergence of AI among FDA-regulated products. The empirical section of this chapter explores characteristics of AI-supported/driven medical devices (“AI devices”) in the United States.

"JOUR","This paper describes the adoption of automation technologies by US firms across all economic sectors by leveraging a new module introduced in the 2019 Annual Business Survey, conducted by the US Census Bureau in partnership with the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES). The module collects data from over 300,000 firms on the use of five advanced technologies: AI, robotics, dedicated equipment, specialized software, and cloud computing. The adoption of these technologies remains low (especially for AI and robotics), varies substantially across industries, and concentrates on large and young firms. However, because larger firms are much more likely to adopt them, 12-64% of US workers and 22-72% of manufacturing workers are exposed to these technologies. Firms report a variety of motivations for adoption, including automating tasks previously performed by labor. Consistent with the use of these technologies for automation, adopters have higher labor productivity and lower labor shares. In particular, the use of these technologies is associated with a 11.4% higher labor productivity, which accounts for 20-30% of the difference in labor productivity between large firms and the median firm in an industry. Adopters report that these technologies raised skill requirements and led to greater demand for skilled labor but brought limited or ambiguous effects to their employment levels.","A","automation and the workforce: a firm-level view from the 2019 annual business survey","zolas, nikolas","10.3386/w30659","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w30659.pdf","published as Daron Acemoglu, Gary W.

Using data on 12th graders from Monitoring the Future, we obtain robust evidence that federal and state age-18 MLPAs decreased underage e-cigarette use by 15–20% and frequent use by 20–40%.

Healthcare is no exception. Dozens of recent academic studies demonstrate that AI can contribute to the healthcare value chain, by improving both diagnostic accuracy and treatment recommendations. In these ways, AI may wither complement or substitute for physicians. We argue that AI represents the culmination of decades of efforts to enhance medical decision making.

We first show that the folk theory of machine learning – that an algorithms learns optimally to minimize the loss function used in training – rests on a shaky foundation. We then identify a path forward by translating ideas from the costly learning branch of cognitive economics. We find that changes in the loss function impact learning just as they might if the algorithm was a rational human being who found learning costly according to a revealed pseudo-cost function that may or may not correspond to actual resource costs.

"JOUR","Currently, most U.S. electricity consumers pay a constant price per kWh consumed that accounts for most of their bill. Ongoing developments in the power system increase efficiency gains that can be made from exposing consumers to widely varying wholesale spot prices. Pure spot pricing is not popular; consumers (and politicians) value price predictability and bill stability. We focus on second-best alternatives: time-of-use (TOU) and critical peak pricing (CPP). We introduce alternative assessment criteria tailored to a context with increasing intraday shiftable loads. Using historical data from CAISO, ERCOT and ISO-NE, we find that out-of-sample daily Spearman rank correlations between TOU rates and spot prices can be relatively high (averaging 0.7-0.8), and simulations confirm that TOU rates can reasonably replicate efficient load-shifting incentives (up to 60-70% of the potential). Our analysis suggests that TOU rates, especially when complemented with CPP, can be considerably more socially valuable than previously estimated.","B","electricity retail rate design in a decarbonized economy: an analysis of time-of-use and critical peak pricing","schmalensee, richard","10.3386/w30560","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w30560.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Tim Schittekatte MIT Energy Initiative E19-306c 50 Ames Street Cambridge, MA 02142 E-Mail: schtim@mit.edu  Dharik S.

"JOUR","This paper studies the predictability of ultra high-frequency stock returns and durations to relevant price, volume and transactions events, using machine learning methods. We find that, contrary to low frequency and long horizon returns, where predictability is rare and inconsistent, predictability in high frequency returns and durations is large, systematic and pervasive over short horizons. We identify the relevant predictors constructed from trades and quotes data and examine what determines the variation in predictability across different stock's own characteristics and market environments. Next, we compute how the predictability improves with the timeliness of the data on a scale of milliseconds, providing a valuation of each millisecond gained. Finally, we simulate the impact of getting an (imperfect) peek at the incoming order flow, a look ahead ability that is often attributed to the fastest high frequency traders, in terms of improving the predictability of the following returns and durations.","B","how and when are high-frequency stock returns predictable?","zhou, yifeng","10.3386/w30366","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w30366.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Yacine Aït-Sahalia Department of Economics Bendheim Center for Finance Princeton University Princeton, NJ 08540 Tel: 609/258-4015 Fax: 609/258-0719 E-Mail: yacine@princeton.edu  Jianqing Fan Bendheim Center for Finance 26 Prospect Ave Princeton NJ 08540 E-Mail: jqfan@princeton.edu  Lirong Xue Dept. of Operations Research and Financial Engineering Sherred Hall Princeton, NJ 08544 USA E-Mail: lirongx.pu@gmail.com  Yifeng Zhou Dept. of Operations Research and Financial Engineering Sherred Hall Princeton, NJ 08544 USA E-Mail: yifengz@alumni.princeton.edu",2022,"http://www.nber.org/papers/w30366","No. 30366","Aug-22",NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE
"JOUR","Short-cycle higher education programs (SCPs) can play a central role in skill development and higher education expansion, yet their quality varies greatly within and among countries. In this paper we explore the relationship between programs’ practices and inputs (quality determinants) and student academic and labor market outcomes. We design and conduct a novel survey to collect program-level information on quality determinants and average outcomes for Brazil, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, and Peru. Categories of quality determinants include training and curriculum, infrastructure, faculty, link with productive sector, costs and funding, and other practices on student admission and institutional governance. We also collect administrative, student-level data on higher education and formal employment for SCP students in Brazil and Ecuador and match it to survey data. Using machine learning methods, we select the quality determinants that predict outcomes at the program and student levels. Estimates indicate that some quality determinants may favor academic and labor market outcomes while others may hinder them. Two practices predict improvements in all labor market outcomes in Brazil and Ecuador—teaching numerical competencies and providing job market information—and one practice—teaching numerical competencies—additionally predicts improvements in labor market outcomes for all survey countries. Since quality determinants account for 20-40 percent of the explained variation in student-level outcomes, estimates indicate a role for quality determinants to shrink the quality gap among programs. These findings have implications for the design and replication of high-quality SCPs, their regulation, and the development of information systems.","B","what makes a program good? evidence from short-cycle higher education programs in five developing countries","bassi, marina","10.3386/w30364","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w30364.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Lelys I.

"JOUR","We use machine learning algorithms to construct a novel news-based index of US environmental and climate policy uncertainty (EnvPU) available on a monthly basis over the 1990-2019 period. We find that our EnvPU index spikes during the environmental spending disputes of the 1995-1996 government shutdown, in the early 2010s due the failure of the national cap-and-trade climate bill and during the Trump presidency. We examine how elevated levels of environmental policy uncertainty relate to investments in the low-carbon economy. In firm-level estimations, we find that a rise in the EnvPU index is associated with a reduced probability for cleantech startups to receive venture capital (VC) funding. In financial markets, a rise in our EnvPU index is associated with higher stock volatility for firms with above-average green revenue shares. At the macro level, shocks in our index lead to declines in the number of cleantech VC deals and higher volatility of the main benchmark clean energy exchange-traded fund. Overall, our results are consistent with the notion that policy uncertainty has adverse effects on investments for the low-carbon economy.","B","does environmental policy uncertainty hinder investments towards a low-carbon economy?","van den heuvel, matthias","10.3386/w30361","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w30361.pdf",NA,NA,"presented at ""Economics of Innovation in the Energy Sector"", September 10-18, 2020","Author contact info: Joelle Noailly Geneva Graduate Institute, Switzerland & Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, The Netherlands & Tinbergen Institute, The Netherlands E-Mail: joelle.noailly@graduateinstitute.ch  Laura M.

"JOUR","We derive general, yet simple, sharp bounds on the size of the omitted variable bias for a broad class of causal parameters that can be identified as linear functionals of the conditional expectation function of the outcome. Such functionals encompass many of the traditional targets of investigation in causal inference studies, such as, for example, (weighted) average of potential outcomes, average treatment effects (including subgroup effects, such as the effect on the treated), (weighted) average derivatives, and policy effects from shifts in covariate distribution -- all for general, nonparametric causal models. Our construction relies on the Riesz-Frechet representation of the target functional. Specifically, we show how the bound on the bias depends only on the additional variation that the latent variables create both in the outcome and in the Riesz representer for the parameter of interest. Moreover, in many important cases (e.g, average treatment effects and avearage derivatives) the bound is shown to depend on easily interpretable quantities that measure the explanatory power of the omitted variables. Therefore, simple plausibility judgments on the maximum explanatory power of omitted variables (in explaining treatment and outcome variation) are sufficient to place overall bounds on the size of the bias. Furthermore, we use debiased machine learning to provide flexible and efficient statistical inference on learnable components of the bounds. Finally, empirical examples demonstrate the usefulness of the approach.","B","long story short: omitted variable bias in causal machine learning","syrgkanis, vasilis","10.3386/w30302","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w30302.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Victor Chernozhukov Department of Economics Massachusetts Institute of Technology 77 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, Mass. 02139 E-Mail: vchern@mit.edu  Carlos Cinelli University of Washington  Department of Statistics  Box 354322  Seattle, WA 98195-4322 USA E-Mail: cinelli@uw.edu  Whitney Newey Department of Economics, E52-424 MIT 77 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02139 Tel: 617/253-6420 Fax: 617/253-1330 E-Mail: wnewey@mit.edu  Amit Sharma  No. 9, Lavelle Road  Bengaluru, Karn 560 001 India E-Mail: amshar@microsoft.com  Vasilis Syrgkanis 583 Alvarado Row Stanford, CA 94305 E-Mail: bsyrganis@gmail.com",2022,"http://www.nber.org/papers/w30302","No. 30302","Jul-22",NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE
"JOUR","Correspondence studies have found evidence of age discrimination in callback rates for older workers, but less is known about whether job advertisements can themselves shape the age composition of the applicant pool. We construct job ads for administrative assistant, retail, and security guard jobs, using language from real job ads collected in a prior large-scale correspondence study (Neumark et al., 2019a). We modify the job-ad language to randomly vary whether or not the job ad includes ageist language regarding age-related stereotypes. Our main analysis relies on machine learning methods to design job ads based on the semantic similarity between phrases in job ads and age-related stereotypes. In contrast to a correspondence study in which job searchers are artificial and researchers study the responses of real employers, in our research the job ads are artificial and we study the responses of real job searchers.  We find that job-ad language related to ageist stereotypes, even when the language is not blatantly or specifically age-related, deters older workers from applying for jobs. The change in the age distribution of applicants is large, with significant declines in the average and median age, the 75th percentile of the age distribution, and the share of applicants over 40. Based on these estimates and those from the correspondence study, and the fact that we use real-world ageist job-ad language, we conclude that job-ad language that deters older workers from applying for jobs can have roughly as large an impact on hiring of older workers as direct age discrimination in hiring.","B","help really wanted? the impact of age stereotypes in job ads on applications from older workers","neumark, david","10.3386/w30287","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w30287.pdf",NA,NA,"presented at ""Labor Studies Program Meeting"", April 28, 2023","Author contact info: Ian Burn University of Liverpool Department of Economics Chatham St, Liverpool L69 7ZH United Kingdom E-Mail: ian.burn@liverpool.ac.uk  Daniel Firoozi 500 East 9th Street Claremont, CA 91711 United States E-Mail: dfiroozi@cmc.edu  Daniel Ladd 3151 Social Sciences Plaza Irvine, Unit 92697 US E-Mail: dladd@uci.edu  David Neumark Department of Economics University of California, Irvine 3151 Social Science Plaza Irvine, CA  92697 Tel: 949-824-8496 Fax: 949/824-2182 E-Mail: dneumark@uci.edu",2022,"http://www.nber.org/papers/w30287","No. 30287","Jul-22",NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE

"JOUR","Recent advances in AI represent improvements in prediction. We examine how decision-making and risk management strategies change when prediction improves. The adoption of AI may cause substitution away from risk management activities used when rules are applied (rules require always taking the same action), instead allowing for decision-making (choosing actions based on the predicted state). We provide a formal model evaluating the impact of AI and how risk management, stakes, and inter-related tasks affect AI adoption. The broad conclusion is that AI adoption can be stymied by existing processes designed to address uncertainty. In particular, many processes are designed to enable coordinated decision-making among different actors in an organization. AI can make coordination even more challenging. However, when the cost of changing such processes falls, then the returns from AI adoption increase.","C","prediction machines, insurance, and protection: an alternative perspective on ai's role in production","goldfarb, avi","10.3386/w30177","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w30177.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Ajay K.

"JOUR","This paper shows that shootings are predictable enough to be preventable. Using arrest and victimization records for almost 644,000 people from the Chicago Police Department, we train a machine learning model to predict the risk of being shot in the next 18 months. Out-of-sample accuracy is strikingly high: of the 500 people with the highest predicted risk, almost 13 percent are shot within 18 months, a rate 128 times higher than the average Chicagoan. A central concern is that algorithms may “bake in” bias found in police data, overestimating risk for people likelier to interact with police conditional on their behavior. We show that Black male victims more often have enough police contact to generate predictions. But those predictions are not, on average, inflated; the demographic composition of predicted and actual shooting victims is almost identical.

"JOUR","Targeting is a core element of anti-poverty program design, with benefits typically targeted to those most “deprived” in some sense (e.g., consumption, wealth). A large literature in economics examines how to best identify these households feasibly at scale, usually via proxy means tests (PMTs). We ask a different question, namely, whether targeting the most deprived has the greatest social welfare benefit: in particular, are the most deprived those with the largest treatment effects or do the “poorest of the poor” sometimes lack the circumstances and complementary inputs or skills to take full advantage of assistance? We explore this potential trade-off in the context of an NGO cash transfer program in Kenya, utilizing recent advances in machine learning (ML) methods (specifically, generalized random forests) to learn PMTs that target both a) deprivation and b) high conditional average treatment effects across several policy-relevant outcomes. We find that targeting solely on the basis of deprivation is generally not attractive in a social welfare sense, even when the social planner's preferences are highly redistributive. We show that a planner using simpler prediction models, based on OLS or less sophisticated ML approaches, could reach divergent conclusions. We discuss implications for the design of real-world anti-poverty programs at scale.","B","targeting impact versus deprivation","walker, michael w","10.3386/w30138","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w30138.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Johannes Haushofer Department of Economics   National University of Singapore   1 Arts Link AS2 #06-02  Singapore 117570  Singapore  E-Mail: johannes.haushofer@nus.edu.sg  Paul Niehaus Department of Economics University of California, San Diego 9500 Gilman Drive #0508 La Jolla, CA 92093 Tel: 858/534-3190 Fax: 858/534-7040 E-Mail: pniehaus@ucsd.edu  Carlos Paramo Berkeley United States E-Mail: carlos.paramo@berkeley.edu  Edward Miguel Department of Economics University of California, Berkeley 530 Evans Hall #3880 Berkeley, CA 94720 Tel: 510/642-7162 Fax: 510/642-6615 E-Mail: emiguel@econ.berkeley.edu  Michael W.

"JOUR","Irrigation in the Eastern US receives little attention compared to the West, but farmers in humid states of the US, traditionally reliant on rainfall, have more than tripled irrigation since 1978. We examine this trend in Illinois where there has been a nearly threefold increase in center pivot irrigation systems (CPIS) installations since 1988. Specifically, we analyze where and when CPIS installations occur and their benefits in terms of annual crop yield, irrigated acreage, crop selection, and reduction in drought-related insurance payouts. To do so, we create a novel data set derived from a deep learning model capable of automatically identifying the location of CPIS during drought years along with annual county level crop, weather, and insurance data. The results indicate CPIS installations in Illinois are significantly more common over alluvial aquifers after droughts. Additionally, counties with a higher presence of CPIS do not have higher average crop yields, a shift to more water intensive crops, or an expansion of cropland. However, in drought years CPIS presence does have a significant positive effect on corn yield and a significant negative effect on indemnity payments for both soybeans and corn. The results provide insights into an emerging trend of irrigation in humid regions, raising potential policy considerations for crop insurance and signaling a potential need to address water rights as demand increases.","B","center pivot irrigation systems as a form of drought risk mitigation in humid regions","smith, steven m","10.3386/w30093","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w30093.pdf","published as Daniel Cooley, Steven M.

"JOUR","This review considers the evolution of economic thinking on the relationship between digital technology and inequality across four decades, encompassing four related but intellectually distinct paradigms, which I refer to as the education race, the task polarization model, the automation-reinstatement race, and the era of Artificial Intelligence uncertainty. The nuance of economic understanding has improved across these epochs. Yet, traditional economic optimism about the beneficent effects of technology for productivity and welfare has eroded as understanding has advanced. Given this intellectual trajectory, it would be natural to forecast an even darker horizon ahead. I refrain from doing so because forecasting the “consequences” of technological change treats the future as a fate to be divined rather than an expedition to be undertaken. I conclude by discussing opportunities and challenges that we collectively face in shaping this future.","A","the labor market impacts of technological change: from unbridled enthusiasm to qualified optimism to vast uncertainty","autor, david","10.3386/w30074","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w30074.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: David Autor Department of Economics, E52-438 Massachusetts Institute of Technology 77 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02139 Tel: 617/258-7698 Fax: 617/253-1330 E-Mail: dautor@mit.edu",2022,"http://www.nber.org/papers/w30074","No. 30074","May-22",NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE
"JOUR","Artificial Intelligence is a powerful new technology that will likely have large impacts on the size, direction and composition of international trade flows. Yet almost nothing is known empirically about this. One AI-enabled set of services that can be tracked resides in the palm of our hands: the Mobile Apps used by half the world's population. To analyze the impact of AI on international trade in mobile App services we merge 2014-2020 data on international downloads of mobile Apps with data on the AI patents held by each App's parent company. From this we build a measure of AI deployment. We instrument AI deployment using cost-shifters from the theory of comparative advantage: Countries with a large stock of AI expertise will have a comparative advantage producing AI-intensive Apps. We show the following IV results. (1) Bilateral Trade: AI deployment increases App downloads by a factor of six. (2) Variety Effects: AI deployment doubles the number of exported App varieties. (3) Creative Destruction: AI deployment increases creative destruction (entry and exit of Apps) and in 2020 the net effect was an increase in welfare of between 2.5% and 10.6%.","A","ai, trade and creative destruction: a first look","sun, ruiqi","10.3386/w29980","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w29980.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Daniel Trefler Rotman School of Management University of Toronto 105 St. George Street Toronto, ON M5S 3E6 Tel: 416/946-7945 Fax: 416/978-5433 E-Mail: dtrefler@rotman.utoronto.ca  Ruiqi Sun Rotman School of Management  105 St. George Street Toronto, ON M5S3E6 Canada Tel: 4379890196 E-Mail: sunrq.17@pbcsf.tsinghua.edu.cn",2022,"http://www.nber.org/papers/w29980","No. 29980","Apr-22",NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE

"JOUR","How does the publication of patents affect innovation? We answer this question by exploiting a large-scale natural experiment—the passage of the American Inventor's Protection Act of 1999 (AIPA)—that accelerated the public disclosure of most U.S. patents by two years. We obtain causal estimates by comparing U.S. patents subject to the law change with “twin” European patents which were not. After AIPA's enactment, U.S. patents receive more and faster follow-on citations, indicating an increase in technology diffusion. Technological overlap increases between distant but related patents and decreases between highly similar patents, and patent applications are less likely to be abandoned post-AIPA, suggesting a reduction in duplicative R&D. Firms exposed to one standard deviation longer patent grant delays increased their R&D investment by 4% after AIPA. These findings are consistent with our theoretical framework in which AIPA provisions news shocks about related technologies to follow-on inventors and thus alters their innovation decisions.","B","patent publication and innovation","zhu, chenqi","10.3386/w29770","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w29770.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Deepak Hegde Stern School of Business New York University 40 West Street Suite 722 New York, NY 10012 Tel: 212-998-0674 E-Mail: dhegde@stern.nyu.edu  Kyle F.

While theoretical models that explain the characteristics, benefits, and approaches to create and capture value from GPTs have advanced significantly, empirical methods to identify GPTs are lagging. The handful of available attempts are typically context specific and rely on hindsight. For managers deciding on technology strategy, it means that the classification, when available, comes too late. We propose a more universal approach of assessing the GPT likelihood of emerging technologies using data from online job postings. We benchmark our approach against prevailing empirical GPT methods that exploit patent data and provide an application on a set of emerging technologies. Our application exercise suggests that a cluster of technologies comprised of machine learning and related data science technologies is relatively likely to be GPT.","B","could machine learning be a general purpose technology? a comparison of emerging technologies using data from online job postings","teodoridis, florenta","10.3386/w29767","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w29767.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Avi Goldfarb Rotman School of Management University of Toronto 105 St. George Street Toronto, ON M5S 3E6 Tel: 416/946-8604 Fax: 416/978-5433 E-Mail: agoldfarb@rotman.utoronto.ca  Bledi Taska E-Mail: bt540@nyu.edu  Florenta Teodoridis University of Southern California  Marshall School of Business 701 Exposition Blvd, HOH 503 Los Angeles, CA 90089 E-Mail: florenta.teodoridis@marshall.usc.edu",2022,"http://www.nber.org/papers/w29767","No. 29767","Feb-22",NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE

"JOUR","Public health experts caution that legalization of recreational marijuana may normalize smoking and undermine the decades-long achievements of tobacco control policy.  However, very little is known about the impact of recreational marijuana laws (RMLs) on adult tobacco use.  Using information from four national datasets (National Survey of Drug Use and Health, Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, Current Population Survey-Tobacco Use Supplements, and Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health) and dynamic difference-in-differences and discrete-time hazard approaches, we find little support for the hypothesis that RML enactment leads to increases in adult tobacco use.  In the short-run, RMLs have no effect on tobacco use and in the medium-run, we find some evidence of a lagged reduction in tobacco use on the order of approximately 0.5 to 2 percentage points.  This finding generally persists across cigarettes and e-cigarettes, is robust to event-study analyses generated from estimators designed to expunge bias due to heterogeneous dynamic treatment effects, and persists in panel data-based survival analyses that account for consumption dynamics.  We conclude that fears of adult tobacco-related public health costs from RMLs are, at least in the short- and medium-run, unfounded; instead, there may be important public health benefits from reductions in adult tobacco use.","B","have recreational marijuana laws undermined public health progress on adult tobacco use?","sabia, joseph j","10.3386/w29706","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w29706.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Dhaval M.

We argue that innovation and autocracy can be mutually reinforcing when: (i) the new technology bolsters the autocrat’s power; and (ii) the autocrat’s demand for the technology stimulates further innovation in applications beyond those benefiting it directly. We test for such a mutually reinforcing relationship in the context of facial recognition AI in China. To do so, we gather comprehensive data on AI firms and government procurement contracts, as well as on social unrest across China during the last decade. We first show that autocrats benefit from AI: local unrest leads to greater government procurement of facial recognition AI, and increased AI procurement suppresses subsequent unrest. We then show that AI innovation benefits from autocrats’ suppression of unrest: the contracted AI firms innovate more both for the government and commercial markets. Taken together, these results suggest the possibility of sustained AI innovation under the Chinese regime: AI innovation entrenches the regime, and the regime’s investment in AI for political control stimulates further frontier innovation.","A","ai-tocracy","yuchtman, noam","10.3386/w29466","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w29466.pdf",NA,NA,"presented at ""Economics of Privacy"", March 31 - April 1, 2022","Author contact info: Martin Beraja Department of Economics, E52-504 MIT 77 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02139 Tel: 617/258-6022 E-Mail: martinberaja@gmail.com  Andrew Kao 1805 Cambridge Street Cambridge, MA 02138 USA E-Mail: andrewkao@fas.harvard.edu  David Y.

"JOUR","There is growing concern that the increasing use of machine learning and artificial intelligence-based systems may exacerbate health disparities through discrimination. We provide a hierarchical definition of discrimination consisting of algorithmic discrimination arising from predictive scores used for allocating resources and human discrimination arising from allocating resources by human decision-makers conditional on these predictive scores. We then offer an overarching statistical framework of algorithmic discrimination through the lens of measurement errors, which is familiar to the health economics audience. Specifically, we show that algorithmic discrimination exists when measurement errors exist in either the outcome or the predictors, and there is endogenous selection for participation in the observed data. The absence of any of these phenomena would eliminate algorithmic discrimination. We show that although equalized odds constraints can be employed as bias-mitigating strategies, such constraints may increase algorithmic discrimination when there is measurement error in the dependent variable.","A","understanding algorithmic discrimination in health economics through the lens of measurement errors","bansal, aasthaa","10.3386/w29413","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w29413.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Anirban Basu The CHOICE Institute Departments of Pharmacy, Health Services, and Economics University of Washington, Seattle 1959 NE Pacific St., Box - 357660 Seattle, WA 98195 Tel: 206/616-2986 Fax: 206/543-3964 E-Mail: basua@uw.edu  Noah Hammarlund The CHOICE Institute School of Pharmacy University of Washington, Seattle 1959 NE Pacific St., Box - 357660  Seattle, WA 98195 Tel: 5035216834 E-Mail: noahh@uw.edu  Sara Khor The CHOICE Institute  School of Pharmacy  University of Washington, Seattle E-Mail: khors@uw.edu  Aasthaa Bansal The CHOICE Institute  School of Pharmacy  University of Washington, Seattle E-Mail: abansal@uw.edu",2021,"http://www.nber.org/papers/w29413","No. 29413","Oct-21",NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE

"JOUR","This survey is organized around three main topics: models, econometrics, and empirical applications. Section 2 presents the theoretical framework, introduces the concept of Markov Perfect Nash Equilibrium, discusses existence and multiplicity, and describes the representation of this equilibrium in terms of conditional choice probabilities. We also discuss extensions of the basic framework, including models in continuous time, the concepts of oblivious equilibrium and experience-based equilibrium, and dynamic games where firms have non-equilibrium beliefs. In section 3, we first provide an overview of the types of data used in this literature, before turning to a discussion of identification issues and results, and estimation methods. We review different methods to deal with multiple equilibria and large state spaces. We also describe recent developments for estimating games in continuous time and incorporating serially correlated unobservables, and discuss the use of machine learning methods to solving and estimating dynamic games. Section 4 discusses empirical applications of dynamic games in IO. We start describing the first empirical applications in this literature during the early 2000s. Then, we review recent applications dealing with innovation, antitrust and mergers, dynamic pricing, regulation, product repositioning, advertising, uncertainty and investment, airline network competition, dynamic matching, and natural resources. We conclude with our view of the progress made in this literature and the remaining challenges.","B","dynamic games in empirical industrial organization","ryan, stephen p","10.3386/w29291","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w29291.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Victor Aguirregabiria Department of Economics University of Toronto 150 St. George Street Toronto, M5S 3G7 Tel: 416-978-4603 Fax: 416-978-6713 E-Mail: victor.aguirregabiria@utoronto.ca  Allan Collard-Wexler Department of Economics Duke University 233 Social Sciences Durham, NC 27708 E-Mail: allan.collard-wexler@duke.edu  Stephen P.

"JOUR","In many regions of the world, sparse data on key economic outcomes inhibits the development, targeting, and evaluation of public policy.  We demonstrate how advancements in satellite imagery and machine learning can help ameliorate these data and inference challenges. In the context of an expansion of the electrical grid across Uganda, we show how a combination of satellite imagery and computer vision can be used to develop local-level livelihood measurements appropriate for inferring the causal impact of electricity access on livelihoods. We then show how ML-based inference techniques deliver more reliable estimates of the causal impact of electrification than traditional alternatives when applied to these data. We estimate that grid access improves village-level asset wealth in rural Uganda by 0.17 standard deviations, more than doubling the growth rate over our study period relative to untreated areas.  Our results provide country-scale evidence on the impact of a key infrastructure investment, and provide a low-cost, generalizable approach to future policy evaluation in data sparse environments.","B","using satellite imagery and machine learning to estimate the livelihood impact of electricity access","burke, marshall","10.3386/w29237","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w29237.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Nathan Ratledge Stanford University E-Mail: ratledge@stanford.edu  Gabriel Cadamuro 855 El Camino Real, Ste. 13A #387 Palo Alto, CA 94301 E-Mail: gabe@atlasai.co  Brandon De la Cuesta Stanford University SIEPR, Gunn Building Stanford, CA 94305 E-Mail: brandon.delacuesta@stanford.edu  Matthieu Stigler Center on Food Security and the Environment Stanford University Stanford, CA 94305 E-Mail: mstigler@stanford.edu  Marshall Burke Doerr School of Sustainability Stanford University Stanford, CA 94305 E-Mail: mburke@stanford.edu",2021,"http://www.nber.org/papers/w29237","No. 29237","Sep-21",NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE
"JOUR","Books shape how children learn about society and norms, in part through representation of different characters. We introduce new artificial intelligence methods for systematically converting images into data and apply them, along with text analysis methods, to measure the representation of skin color, race, gender, and age in award winning children’s books widely read in homes, classrooms, and libraries over the last century. We find that more characters with darker skin color appear over time, but the most influential books persistently depict characters with lighter skin color, on average, than other books, even after conditioning on race; we also find that children are depicted with lighter skin than adults on average. Relative to their growing share of the U.S. population, Black and Latinx people are underrepresented in these same books, while White males are overrepresented. Over time, females are increasingly present but appear less often in text than in images, suggesting greater symbolic inclusion in pictures than substantive inclusion in stories. We then present analysis of the supply of, and demand for, books with different levels of representation to better understand the economic behavior that may contribute to these patterns. On the demand side, we show that people consume books that center their own identities. On the supply side, we document higher prices for books that center non-dominant social identities and fewer copies of these books in libraries that serve predominantly White communities. Lastly, we show that the types of children’s books purchased in a neighborhood are related to local political beliefs.","B","what we teach about race and gender: representation in images and text of children’s books","szasz, teodora","10.3386/w29123","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w29123.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Anjali Adukia Harris School of Public Policy The University of Chicago 1307 East 60th Street Chicago, IL 60637 E-Mail: adukia@uchicago.edu  Alex Eble Department of Education Policy and Social Analysis Teachers College Columbia University 525 West 120th Street New York, NY 10027 E-Mail: eble@tc.columbia.edu  Emileigh Harrison Harris School of Public Policy The University of Chicago 1307 East 60th Street Chicago, IL 60637 Tel: 9206454814 E-Mail: harrisone@uchicago.edu  Hakizumwami B.

"JOUR","The rigorous evaluation of anti-poverty programs is key to the fight against global poverty. Traditional approaches rely heavily on repeated in-person field surveys to measure program effects. However, this is costly, time-consuming, and often logistically challenging. Here we provide the first evidence that we can conduct such program evaluations based solely on high-resolution satellite imagery and deep learning methods. Our application estimates changes in household welfare in a recent anti-poverty program in rural Kenya. Leveraging a large literature documenting a reliable relationship between housing quality and household wealth, we infer changes in household wealth based on satellite-derived changes in housing quality and obtain consistent results with the traditional field-survey based approach. Our approach generates inexpensive and timely insights on program effectiveness in international development programs.","B","using satellite imagery and deep learning to evaluate the impact of anti-poverty programs","gonzalez-navarro, marco","10.3386/w29105","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w29105.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Luna Yue Huang Agricultural and Resource Economics  University of California, Berkeley  207 Giannini Hall  Berkeley, CA 94720-3310 E-Mail: yue_huang@berkeley.edu  Solomon M.

"JOUR","Recent studies have concluded that state laws legalizing medical marijuana can reduce deaths from opioid overdoses.  Using data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, a survey uniquely suited to assessing drug misuse, we examine the relationship between recreational marijuana laws (RMLs) and the use of opioids.  Standard difference-in-differences (DD) regression estimates indicate that RMLs do not affect the likelihood of misusing prescription pain relievers such as OxyContin, Percocet, and Vicodin.  Although DD regression estimates provide evidence that state laws legalizing recreational marijuana can reduce the frequency of misusing prescription pain relievers, event-study estimates are noisy and suggest that any effect on the frequency of misuse is likely transitory.","B","recreational marijuana laws and the use of opioids: evidence from nsduh microdata","rees, daniel i","10.3386/w29087","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w29087.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Mir M.

"JOUR","The COVID-19 pandemic has devastated many low- and middle-income countries, causing widespread food insecurity and a sharp decline in living standards. In response to this crisis, governments and humanitarian organizations worldwide have distributed social assistance to over 1.5 billion people. Targeting is a central challenge in administering these programs: given available data, how does one rapidly identify those with the greatest need? Here we show that data from mobile phone networks can improve the targeting of humanitarian assistance. Our approach uses traditional survey data to train machine-learning algorithms to recognize patterns of poverty in mobile phone data; the trained algorithms can then prioritize aid to the poorest mobile subscribers. We evaluate this approach by studying Togo’s flagship emergency cash transfer program, which used these algorithms to disburse millions of dollars in COVID-19 relief aid. Our analysis compares outcomes – including exclusion errors, total social welfare, and measures of fairness – under different targeting regimes. Relative to the geographic targeting options considered by the Government of Togo, the machine learning approach reduces errors of exclusion by 4-21%. Relative to methods requiring a comprehensive social registry (a hypothetical exercise; no such registry exists in Togo), the machine learning approach increases exclusion errors by 9-35%. These results highlight the potential for new data sources to complement traditional methods for targeting humanitarian assistance, particularly in crisis settings when traditional data are missing or out of date.","B","machine learning and mobile phone data can improve the targeting of humanitarian assistance","blumenstock, joshua","10.3386/w29070","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w29070.pdf",NA,NA,"presented at ""Economics of Artificial Intelligence Conference"", September 23-24, 2021","Author contact info: Emily Aiken 102 South Hall University of California, Berkeley Berkeley, CA 94720 USA E-Mail: emilyaiken@berkeley.edu  Suzanne Bellue E-Mail: suzanne.bellue@ensae.fr  Dean Karlan Kellogg Global Hub Northwestern University 2211 Campus Drive Evanston, IL 60208 Tel: 847/491-8706 E-Mail: dean.karlan@gmail.com  Christopher R.

"JOUR","Attitudes towards same-sex relationships in the US have changed radically over a relatively short period of time. After remaining fairly constant for over two decades, opinions became more favorable starting in 1992—a presidential election year in which the Democratic and Republican parties took opposing stands over the status of gay people in society. What roles did political parties and their leaders play in this process of cultural change? Using a variety of techniques including machine learning, we show that the partisan opinion gap emerged substantially prior to 1992—in the mid 1980s —and did not increase as a result of the political debates in 1992-'93. Furthermore, we identify people with a college-and-above education as the potential ""leaders"" of the process of partisan divergence.","B","gay politics goes mainstream: democrats, republicans, and same-sex relationships","parsa, sahar","10.3386/w29062","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w29062.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Raquel Fernández Department of Economics New York University 19 West 4th Street, 6th Floor New York, NY  10012 Tel: 212/998-8908 Fax: 212/995-4186 E-Mail: raquel.fernandez@nyu.edu  Sahar Parsa New York University Department of Economics  19 W 4th Street New York, NY 10012 E-Mail: parsahar@gmail.com",2021,"http://www.nber.org/papers/w29062","No. 29062","Jul-21",NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE

"JOUR","Recreational marijuana laws (RMLs), which legalize the possession of small quantities of marijuana for recreational use, have been adopted by 18 states and the District of Columbia.  Opponents argue that RML-induced increases in marijuana consumption will serve as a “gateway” to harder drug use and crime.  Using data covering the period 2000-2019 from a variety of national sources (the National Survey of Drug Use and Health, the Uniform Crime Reports, the National Vital Statistics System, and the Treatment Episode Data Set) this study is the first to comprehensively examine the effects of legalizing recreational marijuana on hard drug use, arrests, drug overdose deaths, suicides, and treatment admissions.  Our analyses show that RMLs increase adult marijuana use and reduce drug-related arrests over an average post-legalization window of three to four years.  There is little evidence to suggest that RML-induced increases in marijuana consumption encourage the use of harder substances or violent criminal activity, and some evidence that RMLs may aid in reducing opioid-related mortality.","B","is recreational marijuana a gateway to harder drug use and crime?","rees, daniel i","10.3386/w29038","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w29038.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Joseph J.

"JOUR","We propose a new method for solving high-dimensional dynamic programming problems and recursive competitive equilibria with a large (but finite) number of heterogeneous agents using deep learning. We avoid the curse of dimensionality thanks to three complementary techniques: (1) exploiting symmetry in the approximate law of motion and the value function; (2) constructing a concentration of measure to calculate high-dimensional expectations using a single Monte Carlo draw from the distribution of idiosyncratic shocks; and (3) designing and training deep learning architectures that exploit symmetry and concentration of measure. As an application, we find a global solution of a multi-firm version of the classic Lucas and Prescott (1971) model of investment under uncertainty. First, we compare the solution against a linear-quadratic Gaussian version for validation and benchmarking. Next, we solve the nonlinear version where no accurate or closed-form solution exists.

The surge in new business applications has been uneven across sectors. Ten 3-digit NAICS industries account for 75% of the surge. Dominant industries include Nonstore Retail (alone accounting for 33% of the surge), Professional, Scientific and Technical Services, Truck Transportation, and Accommodation and Food Services.

"JOUR","Many models from epidemiology are not designed to capture tradeoffs between health and economic well-being and few are equipped to predict how these tradeoffs interact with individuals’ preferences to influence behavior. Policies based on such models may not reflect societal preferences or capture how preferences affect behavior and disease spread. Models with epidemiological processes that do incorporate behavior change or health-wealth tradeoffs (mostly from economics) drastically limit individual-level heterogeneity to remain tractable. This makes it difficult to understand variation in behavioral responses and distributional consequences of the pandemic, which should be central to any evaluation of pandemic-related policy. Without the proper tools, we are unable to fully address even basic policy questions, such as whether the long-run effects of social-distancing justify the costs - and if so, for whom and under what circumstances. After reviewing modeling approaches from epidemiology and economics (among other fields), I propose a framework adapted from earlier work on the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Analysis of individual behavior is based on the idea that health is a form of human capital in which individuals invest through their choices. The model integrates individual level variation that other frameworks omit, but does so at the cost of drastically limiting aggregate economic and epidemiological processes. I conclude that what is needed is a multi-disciplinary effort that helps to bridge gaps across disciplines, which would amount to constructing models that capture key features of different approaches. To be useful in evaluating pandemic-related policy, such a model should have rich heterogeneity and capture how individual choices are linked to the broad contours of disease spread and aggregate economic output. Whether such an effort would be feasible and fruitful remains to be seen.","B","modeling behavior during a pandemic: using hiv as an historical analogy","papageorge, nicholas w","10.3386/w28898","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w28898.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Nicholas W.

"JOUR","A key approach used by federal governments to address public health issues is to allocate federal funds to support local responses, but little is known about the effectiveness of this approach for improving health. This study examines the impact of federal public health funds allocated to U.S. cities through the U.S. government’s primary mechanism for combating HIV/AIDS for the past three decades. The empirical approach identifies the impact of this funding by studying funding variation that comes from policy features that resulted in large funding differences among cities that were originally on parallel HIV/AIDS trajectories. The findings indicate that an HIV/AIDS death has been prevented for every $334,000 allocated through the city-level funding and that the $19 billion allocated to cities through this program through 2018 has saved approximately 57,000 lives, which represents over $560 billion of value in terms of lives saved assuming a value of a statistical life of $10 million. The findings also indicate that funding differences across cities have been a major contributor to the uneven progress in combating HIV/AIDS currently observed across the United States that has alarmed public health leaders. Thus, while this analysis supports allocating federal funds to local areas as part of a public health strategy, these funds being effective demonstrates how sustained differences in areas’ receipt of federal public health funds can contribute to the development of health disparities across areas, as has occurred with HIV/AIDS.","B","evidence and lessons on the health impacts of public health funding from the fight against hiv/aids","dillender, marcus","10.3386/w28867","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w28867.pdf",NA,NA,"presented at ""SI 2022 Health Care"", July 28-29, 2022","Author contact info: Marcus Dillender Department of Medicine, Health, and Society Vanderbilt University 422 Buttrick Hall Nashville, TN 37235 E-Mail: marcus.o.dillender@vanderbilt.edu",2021,"http://www.nber.org/papers/w28867","No. 28867","May-21",NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE
"JOUR","Analyses of AI adoption focus on its adoption at the individual task level. What has received significantly less attention is how AI adoption is shaped by the fact that organisations are composed of many interacting tasks. AI adoption may, therefore, require system-wide change which is both a constraint and an opportunity. We provide the first formal analysis where multiple tasks may be part of a modular or non-modular system. We find that reliance on AI, a prediction tool, increases decision variation which, in turn, raises challenges if decisions across the organisation interact. Modularity, which leads to task independence rather than system-level inter-dependencies,  softens that impact. Thus, modularity can facilitate AI adoption. However, it does this at the expense of synergies. By contrast, when there are mechanisms for inter-decision coordination, AI adoption is enhanced when there is a non-modular environment. Consequently, we show that there are important cases where AI adoption will be enhanced when it can be adopted beyond tasks but as part of a designed organisational system.","A","ai adoption and system-wide change","goldfarb, avi","10.3386/w28811","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w28811.pdf",NA,NA,"presented at ""SI 2021 IT and Digitization "", July 22-23, 2021","Author contact info: Ajay K.

In the contest of “man vs machine,” the relative advantage of the AI Analyst is stronger when the firm is complex, and when information is high-dimensional, transparent and voluminous. Human analysts remain competitive when critical information requires institutional knowledge (such as the nature of intangible assets). The edge of the AI over human analysts declines over time when analysts gain access to alternative data and to in-house AI resources. Combining AI’s computational power and the human art of understanding soft information produces the highest potential in generating accurate forecasts.

"JOUR","I examine the specialization of US commuting zones in AI-related occupations over the 2000 to 2018 period. I define AI-related jobs based on keywords in Census occupational titles. Using the approach in Lin (2011) to identify new work, I measure job growth related to AI by weighting employment growth in AI-related occupations by the share of job titles in these occupations that were added after 1990. Overall, regional specialization in AI-related activities mirrors that of regional specialization in IT. However, foreign-born and native-born workers within the sector tend to cluster in different locations. Whereas specialization of the foreign-born in AI-related jobs is strongest in high-tech hubs with a preponderance of private-sector employment, native-born specialization in AI-related jobs is strongest in centers for military and space-related research. Nationally, foreign-born workers account for 55% of job growth in AI-related occupations since 2000. In regression analysis, I find that US commuting zones exposed to a larger increases in the supply of college-educated immigrants became more specialized in AI-related occupations and that this increased specialization was due entirely to the employment of the foreign born. My results suggest that access to highly skilled workers constrains AI-related job growth and that immigration of the college-educated helps relax this constraint.","A","immigration and regional specialization in ai","hanson, gordon h","10.3386/w28671","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w28671.pdf",NA,NA,"presented at ""Economics of Artificial Intelligence Conference"", September 23-24, 2021","Author contact info: Gordon H.

"JOUR","Workfare programs are one of the most popular social protection and employment policy instruments in the developing world. They evoke the promise of efficient targeting, as well as immediate and lasting impacts on participants’ employment, earnings, skills and behaviors. This paper evaluates contemporaneous and post-program impacts of a public works intervention in Côte d’Ivoire. The program was randomized among urban youths who self-selected to participate and provided seven months of employment at the formal minimum wage. Randomized subsets of beneficiaries also received complementary training on basic entrepreneurship or job search skills. During the program, results show limited impacts on the likelihood of employment, but a shift toward wage jobs, higher earnings and savings, as well as changes in work habits and behaviors. Fifteen months after the program ended, savings stock remain higher, but there are no lasting impacts on employment or behaviors, and only limited impacts on earnings. Machine learning techniques are applied to assess whether program targeting can improve. Significant heterogeneity in impacts on earnings is found during the program but not post-program. Departing from self-targeting improves performance: a range of practical targeting mechanisms achieve impacts close to a machine learning benchmark by maximizing contemporaneous impacts without reducing post-program impacts. Impacts on earnings remain substantially below program costs even under improved targeting.","B","do workfare programs live up to their promises? experimental evidence from cote d’ivoire","premand, patrick","10.3386/w28664","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w28664.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Marianne Bertrand Booth School of Business University of Chicago 5807 South Woodlawn Avenue Chicago, IL  60637 Tel: 773/834-5943 Fax: 773/702-0458 E-Mail: marianne.bertrand@chicagobooth.edu  Bruno Crépon CREST 15, boulevard Gabriel Peri 92245 Malakoff Cedex France E-Mail: crepon@ensae.fr  Alicia Marguerie 1818 H St. NW, MSN MC7-634  Washington, DC 20433 USA E-Mail: amarguerie@worldbank.org  Patrick Premand 1818 H Street, N.W.

"JOUR","Thirty-six states have legalized medical marijuana and 14 states have legalized the use of marijuana for recreational purposes. In this paper, we review the literature on the public health consequences of legalizing marijuana, focusing on studies that have appeared in economics journals as well as leading public policy, public health, and medical journals. Among the outcomes considered are: youth marijuana use, alcohol consumption, the abuse of prescription opioids, traffic fatalities, and crime. For some of these outcomes, there is a near consensus in the literature regarding the effects of medical marijuana laws (MMLs). As an example, leveraging geographic and temporal variation in MMLs, researchers have produced little credible evidence to suggest that legalization promotes marijuana use among teenagers. Likewise, there is convincing evidence that young adults consume less alcohol when medical marijuana is legalized. For other public health outcomes such as mortality involving prescription opioids, the effect of legalizing medical marijuana has proven more difficult to gauge and, as a consequence, we are less comfortable drawing firm conclusions. Finally, it is not yet clear how legalizing marijuana for recreational purposes will affect these and other important public health outcomes. We will be able to draw stronger conclusions when more post-treatment data are collected in states that have recently legalized recreational marijuana.","B","the public health effects of legalizing marijuana","rees, daniel i","10.3386/w28647","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w28647.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: D.

In our application, we measure agency for 209 women in Haryana, India, first, through a semi-structured interview and, second, through a large set of close-ended questions. We use qualitative coding methods to score each woman's agency based on the interview, which we treat as her true agency. To identify the close-ended questions most predictive of the ""truth,"" we apply statistical algorithms that build on LASSO and random forest but constrain how many variables are selected for the model (five in our case). The resulting five-question index is as strongly correlated with the coded qualitative interview as is an index that uses all of the candidate questions. This approach of selecting survey questions based on their statistical correspondence to coded qualitative interviews could be used to design short survey modules for many other latent constructs.","B","using machine learning and qualitative interviews to design a five-question women's agency index","cooper, jan","10.3386/w28626","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w28626.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Seema Jayachandran Department of Economics Julis Romo Rabinowitz Building Princeton University Princeton, NJ 08544 E-Mail: jayachandran@princeton.edu  Monica Biradavolu 3541 16th Street NW Washington, DC 20010.

"JOUR","The behavior of artificial intelligences algorithms (AIAs) is shaped by how they learn about their environment. We compare the prices generated by AIAs that use different learning protocols when there is market interaction. Asynchronous learning occurs when the AIA only learns about the return from the action it took. Synchronous learning occurs when the AIA conducts counterfactuals to learn about the returns it would have earned had it taken an alternative action. The two lead to markedly different market prices. When future profits are not given positive weight by the AIA, synchronous updating leads to competitive pricing, while asynchronous can lead to pricing close to monopoly levels. We investigate how this result varies when either counterfactuals can only be calculated imperfectly and/or when the AIA places a weight on future profits.","B","artificial intelligence and pricing: the impact of algorithm design","pakes, ariel","10.3386/w28535","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w28535.pdf",NA,NA,"presented at ""Market Design Working Group Meeting"", November 4-5, 2022","Author contact info: John Asker Department of Economics University of California, Los Angeles Bunche Hall 8363 405 Hilgard Avenue Los Angeles, CA 90095-1477 Tel: (310) 794 4892 E-Mail: johnasker@econ.ucla.edu  Chaim Fershtman The Eitan Berglas School of Economics Rm. 203 Tel Aviv University Tel Aviv, Israel 69978 E-Mail: fersht@post.tau.ac.il  Ariel Pakes Department of Economics Harvard University Littauer Room 117 Cambridge, MA 02138 Tel: 617/495-5320 Fax: 617/496-7352 E-Mail: apakes@fas.harvard.edu",2021,"http://www.nber.org/papers/w28535","No. 28535","Mar-21",NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE

"JOUR","What happens when patients suddenly stop taking their medications? We study the health consequences of drug interruptions caused by large, abrupt, and arbitrary changes in price. Medicare’s prescription drug benefit as-if-randomly assigns 65-year-olds a drug budget as a function of their birth month, beyond which out-of-pocket costs suddenly increase. Those facing smaller budgets consume fewer drugs and die more: 0.0164 percentage points per month (13.9%) for each $100 per month budget decrease (24.4%). This estimate is robust to a range of falsification checks, and lies in the 97.4th percentile of 541 placebo estimates, formed in similar populations that lack the same idiosyncratic budget policy. Several facts help make sense of this large effect. First, patients stop taking drugs that are both ‘high-value,’ and suspected to cause life-threatening withdrawal syndromes when stopped. Second, using machine learning, we identify patients at the highest risk of drug-preventable adverse events. Contrary to the predictions of standard economic models, high-risk patients (e.g., those most likely to have a heart attack) cut back more than low-risk patients on exactly those drugs that would benefit them the most (e.g., statins). Finally, patients appear unaware of these risks. In a survey of 65-year-olds, only one-third believe that missing their drugs for up to a month could have any serious consequences. We conclude that, far from curbing waste, cost-sharing policies cause patients to miss opportunities to buy health at very low cost ($11,321 per life-year).","B","the health costs of cost-sharing","obermeyer, ziad","10.3386/w28439","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w28439.pdf",NA,NA,"presented at ""SI 2021 Health Care"", July 29-30, 2021","Author contact info: Amitabh Chandra John F.

"JOUR","For over two centuries, the municipal bond market has been a source of systemic risk, which returned early in the Covid-19 downturn when borrowing from securities markets became costly for many private and public entities, and some found it difficult to borrow at all.  Indeed, just before the Fed announced its unprecedented intervention into the municipal (muni) bond market, spreads of muni over Treasury yields rose in line with the unemployment rate and appeared headed to levels not seen since the Great Depression, when real municipal gross investment plunged 35 percent below 1929 levels. To prevent a repeat, the Fed created the Municipal Liquidity Facility (MLF) to purchase newly issued, (near) investment grade state and local government bonds at normal ratings-based interest rate spreads over Treasury bonds plus a fee of 100 basis points, later reduced to 50 basis points. Despite a modest take-up, the MLF has effectively capped muni spreads at near normal levels plus the Fed fee and limited the extent to which interest rate spreads could have amplified the impact of the Covid pandemic. To establish the MLF the Fed needed Treasury indemnification against default losses. There are concerns about whether the creation of the MLF could undermine the efficiency of the bond market if the facility lasts too long and could induce moral hazard among borrowers. How the MLF will be unwound will affect these downside aspects and help answer the question whether the program’s benefits exceed its costs.","B","how the new fed municipal bond facility capped muni-treasury yield spreads in the covid-19 recession","duca, john v","10.3386/w28437","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w28437.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Michael D.

We apply modern machine learning tools to construct demographically-based treatment groups capturing around 75% of all minimum wage workers—a major improvement over the literature which has focused on fairly narrow subgroups where the policy has a large bite (e.g., teens). By exploiting 172 prominent minimum wages between 1979 and 2019 we find that there is a very clear increase in average wages of workers in these groups following a minimum wage increase, while there is little evidence of employment loss. Furthermore, we find no indication that minimum wage has a negative effect on the unemployment rate, on the labor force participation, or on the labor market transitions. Furthermore, we detect no employment or participation responses even for sub-groups that are likely to have a high extensive margin labor supply elasticity—such as teens, older workers, or single mothers.

Our approach guarantees that picking certain time dependent sets of weights will be asymptotically similar for out-of-sample forecasts to the best ex post combination of models; it also guarantees that we outperform any individual forecasting model asymptotically. We analyse which models provide the most information for our predictions at each point in time and for each country, allowing us to gain some insights into economic mechanisms underlying the building of risk in economies.","B","answering the queen: machine learning and financial crises","stavrakeva, vania","10.3386/w28302","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w28302.pdf",NA,NA,"presented at ""International Finance and Macroeconomics Program Meeting"", October 25, 2019","Author contact info: Jeremy Fouliard Paris School of Economics PARIS France E-Mail: jfouliard@london.edu  Michael Howell Audley House  CrossBorder Capital  SW1E SHX, London  United Kingdom E-Mail: mjh@liquidity.com  Hélène Rey London Business School Regents Park London NW1 4SA United Kingdom Tel: 44 2070008412 E-Mail: hrey@london.edu  Vania Stavrakeva London Business School Regent's Park London NW1 4SA United Kingdom E-Mail: vania.stavrakeva@gmail.com",2020,"http://www.nber.org/papers/w28302","No. 28302","Dec-20",NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE
"JOUR","We compare predictions from a conventional protocol-based approach to risk assessment with those based on a machine-learning approach. We first show that the conventional predictions are less accurate than, and have similar rates of negative prediction error as, a simple Bayes classifier that makes use only of the base failure rate. Machine learning algorithms based on the underlying risk assessment questionnaire do better under the assumption that negative prediction errors are more costly than positive prediction errors. Machine learning models based on two-year criminal histories do even better. Indeed, adding the protocol-based features to the criminal histories adds little to the predictive adequacy of the model. We suggest using the predictions based on criminal histories to prioritize incoming calls for service, and devising a more sensitive instrument to distinguish true from false positives that result from this initial screening.","B","comparing conventional and machine-learning approaches to risk assessment in domestic abuse cases","kirchmaier, tom","10.3386/w28293","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w28293.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Jeffrey Grogger University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy 1307 E. 60th Street Chicago, IL. 60637 Tel: 773/542-3533 Fax: 773/702-0926 E-Mail: jgrogger@uchicago.edu  Sean Gupta Center for Economic Performance London School of Economics and Political Science Houghton Street London WC2A 2AE UK E-Mail: arijitsean.gupta1@googlemail.com  Ria Ivandic Houghton Street London WC2A 2AE United Kingdom E-Mail: r.ivandic@lse.ac.uk  Tom Kirchmaier Houghton Street London WC2A 2AE United Kingdom E-Mail: t.kirchmaier@lse.ac.uk",2020,"http://www.nber.org/papers/w28293","No. 28293","Dec-20",NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE
"JOUR","We introduce a new survey module intended to complement and expand research on the causes and consequences of advanced technology adoption. The 2018 Annual Business Survey (ABS), conducted by the Census Bureau in partnership with the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES), provides comprehensive and timely information on the diffusion among U.S. firms of advanced technologies including artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, robotics, and the digitization of business information. The 2018 ABS is a large, nationally representative sample of over 850,000 firms covering all private, nonfarm sectors of the economy. We describe the motivation for and development of the technology module in the ABS, as well as provide a first look at technology adoption and use patterns across firms and sectors. We find that digitization is quite widespread, as is some use of cloud computing. In contrast, advanced technology adoption is rare and generally skewed towards larger and older firms. Adoption patterns are consistent with a hierarchy of increasing technological sophistication, in which most firms that adopt AI or other advanced business technologies also use the other, more widely diffused technologies. Finally, while few firms are at the technology frontier, they tend to be large so technology exposure of the average worker is significantly higher. This new data will be available to qualified researchers on approved projects in the Federal Statistical Research Data Center network.","A","advanced technologies adoption and use by u.s. firms: evidence from the annual business survey","dinlersoz, emin","10.3386/w28290","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w28290.pdf",NA,NA,"presented at ""SI 2020 IT and Digitization "", July 16-17, 2020","Author contact info: Nikolas Zolas Center for Economic Studies U.S. Census Bureau 4600 Silver Hill Road Washington, DC 20233 E-Mail: nick.zolas@gmail.com  Zachary Kroff Center for Economic Studies U.S. Census Bureau 4600 Silver Hill Road  Washington, DC 20233 United States Tel: 301-763-2199 E-Mail: zachary.kroff@census.gov  Erik Brynjolfsson Stanford Digital Economy Laboratory 353 Jane Stanford Way, Office 136 Stanford, CA 94305 E-Mail: erik.brynjolfsson@gmail.com  Kristina McElheran University of Toronto Scarborough 105 St. George Street Toronto, ON M5S 3E6 E-Mail: k.mcelheran@utoronto.ca  David N.

"JOUR","This paper estimates the impact of external demand shocks on real income. Our empirical strategy is based on a first order approximation to a wide class of small open economy models that feature sector-level gravity in trade flows. The framework allows us to measure foreign shocks and characterize their impact on income in terms of reduced-form elasticities. We use machine learning techniques to group 4-digit manufacturing sectors into a smaller number of clusters, and show that the cluster-level elasticities of income with respect to foreign shocks can be estimated using high-dimensional statistical techniques. We find clear evidence of heterogeneity in the income responses to different foreign shocks. Foreign demand shocks in complex intermediate and capital goods have large positive impacts on real income, whereas impacts in other sectors are negligible. The estimates imply that the pattern of sectoral specialization plays a quantitatively large role in how foreign shocks affect real income, while geographic position plays a smaller role. Finally, a calibrated multi-sector production and trade model can rationalize both the average and the heterogeneity in real income elasticities to foreign shocks under reasonable values of structural parameters.","B","specialization, market access and real income","levchenko, andrei a","10.3386/w28274","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w28274.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Dominick G.

"JOUR","There is growing concern that the rise of algorithmic decision-making can lead to discrimination against legally protected groups, but measuring such algorithmic discrimination is often hampered by a fundamental selection challenge. We develop new quasi-experimental tools to overcome this challenge and measure algorithmic discrimination in the setting of pretrial bail decisions. We first show that the selection challenge reduces to the challenge of measuring four moments: the mean latent qualification of white and Black individuals and the race-specific covariance between qualification and the algorithm’s treatment recommendation. We then show how these four moments can be estimated by extrapolating quasi-experimental variation across as-good-as-randomly assigned decision-makers. Estimates from New York City show that a sophisticated machine learning algorithm discriminates against Black defendants, even though defendant race and ethnicity are not included in the training data. The algorithm recommends releasing white defendants before trial at an 8 percentage point (11 percent) higher rate than Black defendants with identical potential for pretrial misconduct, with this unwarranted disparity explaining 77 percent of the observed racial disparity in algorithmic recommendations. We find a similar level of algorithmic discrimination with regression-based recommendations, using a model inspired by a widely used pretrial risk assessment tool.","B","measuring racial discrimination in algorithms","hull, peter","10.3386/w28222","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w28222.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: David Arnold Department of Economics University of California, San Diego 9500 Gilman Drive San Diego, CA 92093 E-Mail: daarnold@ucsd.edu  Will S.

Our method achieves accuracy competitive with deep neural networks at orders of magnitude lower computational cost, scales globally, delivers label super-resolution predictions, and facilitates characterizations of uncertainty.

"JOUR","We curate and characterize a complete set of citations from patents to scientific articles, including nearly 16 million from the full text of USPTO and EPO patents. Combining heuristics and machine learning, we achieve 25% higher performance than machine learning alone. At 99.4% accuracy, coverage of 87.6% is achieved, and coverage above 90% with accuracy above 93%. Performance is evaluated with a set of 5,939 randomly-sampled, cross-verified “known good” citations, which the authors have never seen. We compare these “in-text” citations with the “official” citations on the front page of patents. In-text citations are more diverse temporally, geographically, and topically. They are less self-referential and less likely to be recycled from one patent to the next. That said, in-text citations have been overshadowed by front-page in the past few decades, dropping from 80% of all paper-to-patent citations to less than 40%. In replicating two published articles that use only citations on the front page of patents, we show that failing to capture those in the body text leads to understating the relationship between academic science and commercial invention.

"JOUR","Firm-level stock returns differ enormously in reaction to COVID-19 news. We characterize these reactions using the Risk Factors discussions in pre-pandemic 10-K filings and two text-analytic approaches: expert-curated dictionaries and supervised machine learning (ML). Bad COVID-19 news lowers returns for firms with high exposures to travel, traditional retail, aircraft production and energy supply—directly and via downstream demand linkages—and raises them for firms with high exposures to healthcare policy, e-commerce, web services, drug trials and materials that feed into supply chains for semiconductors, cloud computing and telecommunications. Monetary and fiscal policy responses to the pandemic strongly impact firm-level returns as well, but differently than pandemic news. Despite methodological differences, dictionary and ML approaches yield remarkably congruent return predictions. Importantly though, ML operates on a vastly larger feature space, yielding richer characterizations of risk exposures and outperforming the dictionary approach in goodness-of-fit. By integrating elements of both approaches, we uncover new risk factors and sharpen our explanations for firm-level returns. To illustrate the broader utility of our methods, we also apply them to explain firm-level returns in reaction to the March 2020 Super Tuesday election results.","B","firm-level risk exposures and stock returns in the wake of covid-19","seminario-amez, cristhian","10.3386/w27867","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w27867.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Steven J.

Using a triple-differences strategy, we find that data-rich contracts, compared to data-scarce ones, lead recipient firms to develop significantly and substantially more commercial AI software.

This increases testing efficiency, such that increasing frequency by x times only increases expected tests by around √x rather than x. However, this calculation omits a further benefit of frequent testing: infected people are quickly removed from the population, which lowers prevalence and generates further eﬃciency. Accounting for this decline in intra-group spread, we show that increasing frequency can paradoxically reduce the total testing cost. Second, we show that group size and eﬃciency increases with intra-group risk correlation, which is expected in natural test groupings based on proximity. Third, because optimal groupings depend on uncertain risk and correlation, we show how better estimates from machine learning can drive large efficiency gains. We conclude that frequent group testing, aided by machine learning, is a promising and inexpensive surveillance strategy.","B","group testing in a pandemic: the role of frequent testing, correlated risk, and machine learning","wang, ao","10.3386/w27457","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w27457.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Ned Augenblick University of California, Berkeley Haas School of Business EAP Group 545 Student Services Building, 1900 Berkeley, CA 94720-1900 Tel: 650-804-5281 E-Mail: ned@haas.berkeley.edu  Jonathan T.

We find that distortions are large even for professional forecasters, with all respondent-types over-weighting their own beliefs relative to publicly available information. Forecasts of inflation and GDP growth oscillate between optimism and pessimism by large margins, with biases in expectations evolving dynamically in response to cyclical shocks.

"JOUR","We study the interaction of search and application approval in credit markets. We combine a unique dataset, which details search behavior for a large sample of mortgage borrowers, with loan application and rejection decisions. Our data reveal substantial dispersion in mortgage rates and search intensity, conditional on observables. However, in contrast to predictions of standard search models, we find a novel non-monotonic relationship between search and realized prices: borrowers, who search a lot, obtain more expensive mortgages than borrowers' with less frequent search. The evidence suggests that this occurs because lenders screen borrowers' creditworthiness, rejecting unworthy borrowers, which differentiates consumer credit markets from other search markets. Based on these insights, we build a model that combines search and screening in presence of asymmetric information. Risky borrowers internalize the probability that their application is rejected, and behave as if they had higher search costs. The model rationalizes the relationship between search, interest rates, defaults, and application rejections, and highlights the tight link between credit standards and pricing. We estimate the parameters of the model and study several counterfactuals. The model suggests that “overpayment” may be a poor proxy for consumer unsophistication since it partly represents rational search in presence of rejections. Moreover, the development of improved screening technologies from AI and big data (i.e., fintech lending) could endogenously lead to more severe adverse selection in credit markets. Finally, place based policies, such as the Community Reinvestment Act, may affect equilibrium prices through endogenous search responses rather than increased credit risk.","B","searching for approval","yao, vincent","10.3386/w27341","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w27341.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Sumit Agarwal National  University  of  Singapore Mochtar Raidy  Building 15 Kent  Ridge Drive Singapore Tel: +1-202-687-8207 E-Mail: ushakri@yahoo.com  John R.

"JOUR","Rising profitability and market valuations of US businesses, sluggish wage growth and a declining labor share of income, and reduced unemployment and inflation, have defined the macroeconomic environment of the last generation. This paper offers a unified explanation for these phenomena based on reduced worker power. Using individual, industry, and state-level data, we demonstrate that measures of reduced worker power are associated with lower wage levels, higher pr ofit shares, and reductions in measures of the NAIRU. We argue that the declining worker power hypothesis is more compelling as an explanation for observed changes than increases in firms’ market power, both because it can simultaneously explain a falling labor share and a reduced NAIRU, and because it is more directly supported by the data.","B","the declining worker power hypothesis: an explanation for the recent evolution of the american economy","summers, lawrence h","10.3386/w27193","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w27193.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Anna M.

The supervised (unsupervised) ML techniques were trained on data until 2010 (2014), and projections were made for 2011-2016 (2014-2020).

"JOUR","What would a hypothetical one million US deaths in the Covid-19 epidemic mean for mortality of individuals at the population level? To put estimates of Covid-19 mortality into perspective, we estimate age-specific mortality for an epidemic claiming for illustrative purposes one million US lives, with results scalable over a broad range of deaths. We calculate the impact on period life expectancy (down 3 years) and remaining life-years (12.3 years per death), which for one million deaths can be valued at six to 10 trillion dollars. The age-patterns of Covid-19 mortality observed in other countries are remarkably similar and exhibit the typical rate of increase by age of normal mortality. The scenario of one million Covid-19 deaths is similar in scale to the decades-long HIV/AIDS and opioid-overdose epidemics but considerably smaller than the Spanish Flu of 1918. Unlike HIV/AIDS and opioid epidemics, the Covid-19 deaths will be concentrated in months rather than spread out over decades.","B","demographic perspectives on mortality of covid-19 and other epidemics","lee, ronald d","10.3386/w27043","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w27043.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Joshua R.

"JOUR","In numerous high stakes markets skilled experts play a key role in facilitating consumer choice of complex products.  New artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are increasingly being used to augment expert decisions. We study the role of technology and expertise in the market for health insurance, where consumer choices are widely known to be sub-optimal. Our analysis leverages the large-scale implementation of an AI-based decision support tool in a private Medicare exchange where consumers are randomized to skilled agents over time. We find that, prior to AI-based technology, skilled experts in this market exhibit the same type of inconsistent behavior found in previous studies of individual choices, costing consumers $1260 on average.  The addition of AI-based decision support improves outcomes by $278 on average and substantially reduces heterogeneity in broker performance.  Experts efficiently synthesize private information, incorporating AI-based recommendations along dimensions that are well suited to AI (e.g. total expected patient costs), but overruling AI-based recommendations along dimensions for which humans are better suited (e.g. specifics of doctor networks).  As a result, switching plans, an ex-post measure of plan satisfaction, is meaningfully lower for agents making AI-based recommendations. While AI is a complement to skill on average, we find that it is a substitute across the skill distribution; lower quality agents provide better recommendations with AI than the top agents did without it.

"JOUR","A vast firm productivity literature finds that otherwise similar firms differ widely in their productivity and that these differences persist through time, with important implications for the broader macroeconomy. These stylized facts derive largely from studies of manufacturing firms in wealthy countries, and thus have unknown relevance for the world's most common firm type, the smallholder farm. We use detailed micro data from over 12,000 smallholder farms and nearly 100,000 agricultural plots across four countries in Africa to study the size, source, and persistence of productivity dispersion among smallholder farmers. Applying standard regression-based approaches to measuring productivity residuals, we find much larger dispersion but less persistence than benchmark estimates from manufacturing. We then show, using a novel framework that combines physical output measurement, estimates from satellites, and machine learning, that about half of this discrepancy can be accounted for by measurement error in output. After correcting for measurement error, productivity differences across firms and over time in our smallholder agricultural setting closely match benchmark estimates for non-agricultural firms.

"JOUR","Collateral-based monetary policy tools have been used extensively by major central banks. Lack of proper policy counterfactuals, however, makes it difficult to empirically identify their causal effects on the financial market and the real economy. We exploit a quasi-natural experiment in China, where dual-listed bonds are traded in two mostly segmented markets: the interbank market regulated by the Central Bank, and the exchange market regulated by the securities regulator. During a policy shift in our study period, China's Central Bank included a class of previously ineligible bonds in the interbank market to become eligible collateral for financial institutions to borrow money from its Medium-Term Lending Facility (MLF). This policy shift allows us to implement a triple-difference strategy to estimate the causal impact of the collateral-based unconventional monetary policy. We find that in the secondary market the policy reduced the spreads of the newly collateralizable bonds in the treatment market (the interbank market) by 42-62 basis points. We also find that there is a pass-through effect from the secondary market to the primary market: the spreads of the treated bonds newly issued in the interbank market were reduced by 54 basis points.",NA,"the collateral channel of monetary policy: evidence from china","wu, xian","10.3386/w26792","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w26792.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Hanming Fang Department of Economics Ronald O.

"JOUR","Risk-adjustment systems used to pay health plans in individual health insurance markets have evolved towards better “fit” of payments to plan spending, at the individual and group levels, generally achieved by adding variables used for risk adjustment.  Adding variables demands further plan and provider-supplied data.  Some data called for in the more complex systems may be easily manipulated by providers, leading to unintended “upcoding” or to unnecessary service utilization.  While these drawbacks are recognized, they are hard to quantify and are difficult to balance against the concrete, measurable improvements in fit that may be attained by adding variables to the formula.  This paper takes a different approach to improving the performance of health plan payment systems.  Using the HHS-HHC V0519 model of plan payment in the Marketplaces as a starting point, we constrain fit at the individual and group level to be as good or better than the current payment model while reducing the number of variables called for in the model.  Opportunities for simplification are created by the introduction of three elements in design of plan payment:  reinsurance (based on high spending or plan losses), constrained regressions, and powerful machine learning methods for variable selection.  We first drop all variables relying on drug claims.  Further major reductions in the number of diagnostic-based risk adjustors are possible using machine learning integrated with our constrained regressions.

The majority of this difference in impacts is due to differences in treatment effects conditional on farmer productivity, rather than differences in borrower selection patterns.

We then train a machine learning algorithm and apply the trained models to a century's worth of medical and mechanical patents that form our analysis sample.  In our analysis of these new data, we find that the relatively stingy, fixed-price contracts of the Civil War era led inventors to focus broadly on reducing costs, while the less cost-conscious procurement contracts of World War I did not.  We provide a conceptual framework that highlights the economic forces that drive this key finding. We also find that inventors emphasized dimensions of product quality (e.g., a prosthetic's appearance or comfort) that aligned with differences in buyers' preferences across wars. Finally, we find that the Civil War and World War I procurement shocks led to substantial increases in the quantity of prosthetic device patenting relative to patenting in other medical and mechanical technology classes.

"JOUR","Many countries have phased out nuclear electricity production in response to concerns about nuclear waste and the risk of nuclear accidents.  This paper examines the impact of the shutdown of roughly half of the nuclear production capacity in Germany after the Fukushima accident in 2011.  We use hourly data on power plant operations and a novel machine learning framework to estimate how plants would have operated differently if the phase-out had not occurred.  We find that the lost nuclear electricity production due to the phase-out was replaced primarily by coal-fired production and net electricity imports.  The social cost of this shift from nuclear to coal is approximately 12 billion dollars per year.

"JOUR","Modern investors face a high-dimensional prediction problem: thousands of observable variables are potentially relevant for forecasting. We reassess the conventional wisdom on market efficiency in light of this fact. In our model economy, which resembles a typical machine learning setting, N assets have cash flows that are a linear function of J firm characteristics, but with uncertain coefficients. Risk-neutral Bayesian investors impose shrinkage (ridge regression) or sparsity (Lasso) when they estimate the J coefficients of the model and use them to price assets. When J is comparable in size to N, returns appear cross-sectionally predictable using firm characteristics to an econometrician who analyzes data from the economy ex post. A factor zoo emerges even without p-hacking and data-mining. Standard in-sample tests of market efficiency reject the no-predictability null with high probability, despite the fact that investors optimally use the information available to them in real time.

"JOUR","Machine learning (ML) is mostly a predictive enterprise, while the questions of interest to labor economists are mostly causal. In pursuit of causal effects, however, ML may be useful for automated selection of ordinary least squares (OLS) control variables. We illustrate the utility of ML for regression-based causal inference by using lasso to select control variables for estimates of effects of college characteristics on wages. ML also seems relevant for an instrumental variables (IV) first stage, since the bias of two-stage least squares can be said to be due to over-fitting. Our investigation shows, however, that while ML-based instrument selection can improve on conventional 2SLS estimates, split-sample IV, jackknife IV, and LIML estimators do better. In some scenarios, the performance of ML-augmented IV estimators is degraded by pretest bias. In others, nonlinear ML for covariate control creates artificial exclusion restrictions that generate spurious findings.

"JOUR","When researchers develop new econometric methods it is common practice to compare the performance of the new methods to those of existing methods in Monte Carlo studies. The credibility of such Monte Carlo studies is often limited because of the  freedom the researcher has in choosing the design. In recent years a new class of generative models emerged in the machine learning literature, termed Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) that  can be used to systematically generate artificial data that closely mimics real economic datasets, while limiting the degrees of freedom for the researcher and optionally satisfying privacy guarantees with respect to their training data. In addition if an applied researcher is concerned with the performance of a particular statistical method on a specific data set (beyond its theoretical properties in large samples), she may wish to assess the performance, e.g., the coverage rate of confidence intervals or the bias of the estimator, using simulated data which resembles her setting. Tol illustrate these methods we apply Wasserstein GANs (WGANs) to compare a number of different estimators for average treatment effects under unconfoundedness in three distinct settings (corresponding to three real data sets) and present a methodology for assessing the robustness of the results. In this example, we find that (i) there is not one estimator that outperforms the others in all three settings, so researchers should tailor their analytic approach to a given setting, and (ii) systematic simulation studies can be helpful for selecting among competing methods in this situation.",NA,"using wasserstein generative adversarial networks for the design of monte carlo simulations","munro, evan m","10.3386/w26566","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w26566.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Susan Athey Graduate School of Business Stanford University 655 Knight Way Stanford, CA 94305 Tel: 650/725-8696 Fax: 650/725-5702 E-Mail: athey@stanford.edu  Guido Imbens Graduate School of Business Stanford University 655 Knight Way Stanford, CA 94305 E-Mail: Imbens@stanford.edu  Jonas Metzger Department of Economics Stanford E-Mail: metzgerj@stanford.edu  Evan M.

"JOUR","We study the relationships between ageist stereotypes – as reflected in the language used in job ads – and age discrimination in hiring, exploiting the text of job ads and differences in callbacks to older and younger job applicants from a resume (correspondence study) field experiment (Neumark, Burn, and Button, 2019). Our analysis uses methods from computational linguistics and machine learning to directly identify, in a field-experiment setting, ageist stereotypes that underlie age discrimination in hiring. The methods we develop provide a framework for applied researchers analyzing textual data, highlighting the usefulness of various computer science techniques for empirical economics research. We find evidence that language related to stereotypes of older workers sometimes predicts discrimination against older workers. For men, our evidence points to age stereotypes about all three categories we consider – health, personality, and skill – predicting age discrimination, and for women, age stereotypes about personality. In general, the evidence is much stronger for men, and our results for men are quite consistent with the industrial psychology literature on age stereotypes.",NA,"older workers need not apply? ageist language in job ads and age discrimination in hiring","neumark, david","10.3386/w26552","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w26552.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Ian Burn University of Liverpool Department of Economics Chatham St, Liverpool L69 7ZH United Kingdom E-Mail: ian.burn@liverpool.ac.uk  Patrick Button Connolly Alexander Institute for Data Science Room B19, Howard-Tilton Memorial Library Tulane University 6823 St. Charles Avenue New Orleans, LA 70118 E-Mail: pbutton@tulane.edu  Luis Felipe Munguia Corella Department of Economics  University of California, Irvine 3151 Social Science Plaza  Irvine, CA 92697 E-Mail: lfmungui@uci.edu  David Neumark Department of Economics University of California, Irvine 3151 Social Science Plaza Irvine, CA  92697 Tel: 949-824-8496 Fax: 949/824-2182 E-Mail: dneumark@uci.edu",2019,"http://www.nber.org/papers/w26552","No. 26552","Dec-19",NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE
"JOUR","Text data is ultra-high dimensional, which makes machine learning techniques indispensable for textual analysis. Text is often selected—journalists, speechwriters, and others craft messages to target their audiences’ limited attention. We develop an economically motivated high dimensional selection model that improves learning from text (and from sparse counts data more generally). Our model is especially useful when the choice to include a phrase is more interesting than the choice of how frequently to repeat it. It allows for parallel estimation, making it computationally scalable. A first application revisits the partisanship of US congressional speech. We find that earlier spikes in partisanship manifested in increased repetition of different phrases, whereas the upward trend starting in the 1990s is due to entirely distinct phrase selection.

"JOUR","We propose a new valuation method for private equity investments. First, we construct a cash-flow replicating portfolio for the private investment, applying Machine Learning techniques on cash-flows on various listed equity and fixed income instruments. The second step values the replicating portfolio using a flexible asset pricing model that accurately prices the systematic risk in bonds of different maturities and a broad cross-section of equity factors. The method delivers a measure of the risk-adjusted profit earned on a PE investment and a time series for the expected return on PE fund categories. We apply the method to buyout, venture capital, real estate, and infrastructure funds, among others. Accounting for horizon-dependent risk and exposure to a broad cross-section of equity factors results in negative average risk-adjusted profits.

Five of the algorithms are taken from the popular NLopt open-source library: (i) Controlled Random Search with local mutation (CRS), (ii) Improved Stochastic Ranking Evolution Strategy (ISRES), (iii) Multi-Level Single-Linkage (MLSL) algorithm, (iv) Stochastic Global Optimization (StoGo), and (v) Evolutionary Strategy with Cauchy distribution (ESCH). The other two algorithms are versions of TikTak, which is a multistart global optimization algorithm used in some recent economic applications. For completeness, we add three popular local algorithms to the comparison—the Nelder-Mead downhill simplex algorithm, the Derivative-Free Non-linear Least Squares (DFNLS) algorithm, and a popular variant of the Davidon-Fletcher-Powell (DFPMIN) algorithm. To give a detailed comparison of algorithms, we use a set of benchmarking tools recently developed in the applied mathematics literature. We find that the success rate of many optimizers vary dramatically with the characteristics of each problem and the computational budget that is available. Overall, TikTak is the strongest performer on both the math test functions and the economic application.

"JOUR","Products often bundle together many functions e.g., smartphones. The firm develops the big idea (which functions to bundle) and then chooses one supplier per function. We develop a model featuring holdup in which the firm's bargaining power declines in the number of suppliers. Greater scope as measured by the number of suppliers exacerbates holdup, but this is partially offset by the appropriate choice of vertical integration or outsourcing. Our main result flows from the empirical observation that the number of functions varies across products within an industry (firm heterogeneity). We introduce the notion of an 'ideas-oriented' industry in which more productive firms have higher marginal returns to introducing a new function. We show that more productive firms will (1) have more suppliers and (2) be more likely to integrate those suppliers. We take this to the data using a neural network to predict whether or not each of 29 million PATSTAT patent applications involves new/improved functions. We merge these patents with Capital IQ data on 55,000 companies and their supplier networks.

"JOUR","This paper investigates how, in a heterogeneous agents model with financial frictions,  idiosyncratic individual shocks interact with exogenous aggregate shocks to generate time-varying levels of leverage and endogenous aggregate risk. To do so, we show how such a model can be efficiently computed, despite its substantial nonlinearities, using tools from machine learning. We also illustrate how the model can be structurally estimated with a likelihood function, using tools from inference with diffusions. We document, first, the strong nonlinearities created by financial frictions. Second, we report the existence of multiple stochastic steady states with properties that differ from the deterministic steady state along important dimensions. Third, we illustrate how the generalized impulse response functions of the model are highly state-dependent. In particular, we find that the recovery after a negative aggregate shock is more sluggish when the economy is more leveraged.

"JOUR","The solar industry in the US typically uses a credit score such as the FICO score as an indicator of consumer utility payment performance and credit worthiness to approve customers for new solar installations. Using data on over 800,000 utility payment performance and over 5,000 demographic variables, we compare machine learning and econometric models to predict the probability of default to credit-score cutoffs. We compare these models across a variety of measures, including how they affect consumers of different socio-economic backgrounds and profitability. We find that a traditional regression analysis using a small number of variables specific to utility repayment performance greatly increases accuracy and LMI inclusivity relative to FICO score, and that using machine learning techniques further enhances model performance. Relative to FICO, the machine learning model increases the number of low-to-moderate income consumers approved for community solar by 1.1% to 4.2% depending on the stringency used for evaluating potential customers, while decreasing the default rate by 1.4 to 1.9 percentage points. Using electricity utility repayment as a proxy for solar installation repayment, shifting from a FICO score cutoff to the machine learning model increases profits by 34% to 1882% depending on the stringency used for evaluating potential customers.",NA,"machine learning for solar accessibility: implications for low-income solar expansion and profitability","roache, kelly","10.3386/w26178","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w26178.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Sruthi Davuluri Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Researc 77 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02139 E-Mail: sruthi@mit.edu  René García Franceschini 77 Massachusetts Ave Cambridge, MA 02139 E-Mail: ragarcia@mit.edu  Christopher R.

"JOUR","We use machine learning as a tool to study decision making, focusing specifically on how physicians diagnose heart attack. An algorithmic model of a patient’s probability of heart attack allows us to identify cases where physician testing decisions deviate from predicted risk. We then use actual health outcomes to evaluate whether those deviations represent mistakes or physicians’ superior knowledge. This approach reveals two inefficiencies. Physicians over-test: predictably low-risk patients are tested, but do not benefit. At the same time, physicians undertest: predictably high-risk patients are left untested, and then go on to suffer adverse health events including death. A natural experiment using shift-to-shift testing variation confirms these findings. Simultaneous over- and under-testing cannot easily be explained by incentives alone, and instead point to systematic errors in judgment. We provide suggestive evidence on the psychology underlying these errors. First, physicians use too simple a model of risk. Second, they overweight factors that are salient or representative of heart attack, such as chest pain.

To offset these biases, researchers must estimate the value of these off-balance sheet intangibles by capitalizing prior flows of R&D and SG&A. In doing so, a set of capitalization parameters must be assumed, i.e., the R&D depreciation rate and the fraction of SG&A that represents a long-lived asset. We estimate these parameters using market prices from firm exits and use them to capitalize intangibles for a comprehensive panel of firms from 1978-2017. We then use a series of validation tests to examine the performance of our intangible capital stocks versus those developed from commonly used parameters. On average, our estimates of intangible capital are 15% smaller than estimates from status-quo parameters while exhibiting larger variation across industry. Intangible capital stocks derived from exit price parameters outperform existing measures when explaining market enterprise values and identifying human capital risk. Adjusting book values with exit-based intangible capital stocks markedly attenuates well-documented biases in market-to-book and return on equity ratios while increasing the precision of the HML asset pricing factor. We conclude that our capitalization parameters create intangible stocks that perform equal to or better than status-quo measures in various applications.",NA,"measuring intangible capital with market prices","wang, sean","10.3386/w25960","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w25960.pdf",NA,NA,"presented at ""SI 2020 Conference on Research in Income and Wealth"", July 13-14, 2020","Author contact info: Michael Ewens Columbia Business School  665 W 130th St Henry Kravis Hall, 732   New York, NY 10027 E-Mail: me2731@columbia.edu  Ryan H.

"JOUR","This paper analyzes  weekly scanner data  collected for 108 groups at the county level  between 2006 and 2014. The data display multi-dimensional  weekly seasonal effects that are not exactly periodic but are cross-sectionally dependent.  Existing univariate procedures are imperfect and yield adjusted series that continue to display strong seasonality upon aggregation. We suggest augmenting the univariate adjustments with a  panel  data step that pools information across counties. Machine learning tools are then used to remove the within-year seasonal variations. A demand analysis of the  adjusted budget shares finds  three factors: one that is trending, and  two cyclical ones that are  well aligned with the level and change in consumer confidence. The effects of the Great Recession vary across  locations and product groups,  with  consumers  substituting towards home cooking away from non-essential goods. The adjusted data also reveal changes in spending to unanticipated shocks at the local level. The data are thus  informative about both local and aggregate economic conditions once the seasonal effects are removed. The two-step methodology  can be adapted to remove other types of nuisance variations provided that these variations  are cross-sectionally dependent.",NA,"a machine learning analysis of seasonal and cyclical sales in weekly scanner data","ng, serena","10.3386/w25899","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w25899.pdf","published as Rishab Guha, Serena Ng.

"JOUR","Between the 2007 and 2012 Economic Censuses (EC), the count of franchise-affiliated establishments declined by 9.8%. One reason for this decline was a reduction in resources that the Census Bureau was able to dedicate to the manual evaluation of survey responses in the franchise section of the EC. Extensive manual evaluation in 2007 resulted in many establishments, whose survey forms indicated they were not franchise-affiliated, being recoded as franchise-affiliated. No such evaluation could be undertaken in 2012. In this paper, we examine the potential of using external data harvested from the web in combination with machine learning methods to automate the process of evaluating responses to the franchise section of the 2017 EC. Our method allows us to quickly and accurately identify and recode establishments have been mistakenly classified as not being franchise-affiliated, increasing the unweighted number of franchise-affiliated establishments in the 2017 EC by 22%-42%.",NA,"automating response evaluation for franchising questions on the 2017 economic census","baer, andrew l","10.3386/w25818","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w25818.pdf","published as Joseph Staudt, Yifang Wei, Lisa Singh, Shawn Klimek, J.

Using our model estimates, we simulate a hypothetical policy which restricts new opioid prescriptions to only those with low predicted risk.

We show that the process of change was discontinuous over time and present suggestive evidence that the 1992 presidential election followed by the “don't ask, don't tell” debate led to a change in attitudes. Using a difference-in-difference empirical strategy, we find that, in accordance with our hypothesis, the change in opinion was greater in states with higher AIDS rates. Our analysis suggests that if individuals in low-AIDS states had experienced the same average AIDS rate as a high-AIDS state, the change in their approval rate from the '70s to the '90s would have been 50 percent greater.",NA,"coming out in america: aids, politics, and cultural change","viarengo, martina","10.3386/w25697","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w25697.pdf",NA,NA,"presented at ""SI 2019 Income Distribution and Macroeconomics "", July 16-18, 2019","Author contact info: Raquel Fernández Department of Economics New York University 19 West 4th Street, 6th Floor New York, NY  10012 Tel: 212/998-8908 Fax: 212/995-4186 E-Mail: raquel.fernandez@nyu.edu  Sahar Parsa New York University Department of Economics  19 W 4th Street New York, NY 10012 E-Mail: parsahar@gmail.com  Martina Viarengo Geneva Graduate Institute  Department of Economics  Chem.

"JOUR","Objective:  The increasing availability of large administrative datasets has led to a particularly exciting innovation in criminal justice research, that of the “low-cost” randomized trial in which administrative data are used to measure outcomes in lieu of costly primary data collection. In this paper, we point out that randomized experiments that make use of administrative data have an unfortunate consequence: the destruction of statistical power. Linking data from an experimental intervention to administrative records that track outcomes of interest typically requires matching datasets without a common unique identifier. In order to minimize mistaken linkages, researchers will often use “exact matching” (retaining an individual only if all their demographic variables match exactly in two or more datasets) in order to ensure that speculative matches do not lead to errors in an analytic dataset.  Methods:  In this paper, we derive an analytic result for the consequences of linking errors on statistical power and show how the problem varies across different combinations of relevant inputs, including the matching error rate, the outcome density and the sample size.  Results: We show that this seemingly conservative approach leads to underpowered experiments and potentially to the failure of entire experimental literatures. For marginally powered studies, which are common in empirical social science, exact matching is particularly problematic.  Conclusions:  We conclude on an optimistic note by showing that simple machine learning-based probabilistic matching algorithms allow criminal justice researchers to recover a considerable share of the statistical power that is lost to errors in data linking.",NA,"administrative data linking and statistical power problems in randomized experiments","hansen, benjamin","10.3386/w25657","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w25657.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Sarah Tahamont University of Maryland 2220 Samuel J.

Second, we discuss how machine learning and human-classification methods can help shed light on cultural traits, using gender roles, attitudes towards risk, and trust as examples. Societies with tales portraying men as dominant and women as submissive tend to relegate their women to subordinate positions in their communities, both historically and today. More risk-averse and less entrepreneurial people grew up listening to stories where competitions and challenges are more likely to be harmful than beneficial.

"JOUR","General purpose technologies (GPTs) such as AI enable and require significant complementary investments, including co-invention of new processes, products, business models and human capital. These complementary investments are often intangible and poorly measured in the national accounts, even when they create valuable assets for the firm. We develop a model that shows how this leads to an underestimation of productivity growth in the early years of a new GPT, and how later, when the benefits of intangible investments are harvested, productivity growth will be overestimated. Our model generates a Productivity J-Curve that can explain the productivity slowdowns often accompanying the advent of GPTs, as well as the increase in productivity later. We use our model to analyze empirically the historical roles of intangibles tied to R&D, software, and computer hardware. We find substantial and ongoing Productivity J-Curve effects for software in particular and computer hardware to a lesser extent.

In 2012, Chilean credit bureaus were forced to stop reporting defaults for 2.8 million individuals (21% of the adult population).

Deletion lowers (raises) predicted default the most for poorer defaulters (non-defaulters) with limited borrowing histories. Using a difference-in-differences design, we show that individuals exposed to increases in predicted default reduce borrowing by 6.4% following deletion, while those exposed to decreases raise borrowing by 11.8%.

We motivate our analysis using a simple model of bias in lending, which predicts that profits should be identical for loan applicants from different groups at the margin if loan examiners are unbiased. We identify the profitability of marginal loan applicants by exploiting variation from the quasi-random assignment of loan examiners. We find significant bias against both immigrant and older loan applicants when using the firm's preferred measure of long-run profits. In contrast, there is no evidence of bias when using a short-run measure used to evaluate examiner performance, suggesting that the bias in our setting is due to the misalignment of firm and examiner incentives.

"JOUR","Patenting in software, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence has grown rapidly in recent years. Such patents are acquired primarily by large US technology firms such as IBM, Microsoft, Google, and HP, as well as by Japanese multinationals such as Sony, Canon, and Fujitsu. Chinese patenting in the US is small but growing rapidly, and world-leading for drone technology. Patenting in machine learning has seen exponential growth since 2010, although patenting in neural networks saw a strong burst of activity in the 1990s that has only recently been surpassed. In all technological fields, the number of patents per inventor has declined near-monotonically, except for large increases in inventor productivity in software and semiconductors in the late 1990s. In most high-tech fields, Japan is the only country outside the US with significant US patenting activity; however, whereas Japan played an important role in the burst of neural network patenting in the 1990s, it has not been involved in the current acceleration.

To assess if the hype is warranted, we use data from the film industry in simulation experiments that contrast econometric approaches with tools from the predictive analytics literature. Further, we propose new strategies that combine elements from each literature in a bid to capture richer patterns of heterogeneity in the underlying relationship governing revenue. Our results demonstrate the importance of social media data and value from hybrid strategies that combine econometrics and machine learning when conducting forecasts with new big data sources. Specifically, while both least squares support vector regression and recursive partitioning strategies greatly outperform dimension reduction strategies and traditional econometrics approaches in fore-cast accuracy, there are further significant gains from using hybrid approaches.

In particular, some occupations and industries may do well while others experience labor market upheaval.

"JOUR","We propose strategies to estimate and make inference on key features of heterogeneous effects in randomized experiments. These key features include best linear predictors of the effects using machine learning proxies, average effects sorted by impact groups, and average characteristics of most and least impacted units. The approach is valid in high dimensional settings, where the effects are proxied (but not necessarily consistently estimated) by predictive and causal machine learning methods. We post-process these proxies into estimates of the key features. Our approach is generic, it can be used in conjunction with penalized methods, neural networks, random forests, boosted trees, and ensemble methods, both predictive and causal. Estimation and inference are based on repeated data splitting to avoid overfitting and achieve validity. We use quantile aggregation of the results across many potential splits, in particular taking medians of p-values and medians and other quantiles of confidence intervals. We show that quantile aggregation lowers estimation risks over a single split procedure, and establish its principal inferential properties. Finally, our analysis reveals ways to build provably better machine learning proxies through causal learning: we can use the objective functions that we develop to construct the best linear predictors of the effects, to obtain better machine learning proxies in the initial step. We illustrate the use of both inferential tools and causal learners with a randomized field experiment that evaluates a combination of nudges to stimulate demand for immunization in India.",NA,"generic machine learning inference on heterogeneous treatment effects in randomized experiments, with an application to immunization in india","fernández-val, iván","10.3386/w24678","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w24678.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Victor Chernozhukov Department of Economics Massachusetts Institute of Technology 77 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, Mass. 02139 E-Mail: vchern@mit.edu  Mert Demirer MIT Sloan School of Management 100 Main St Cambridge, MA 02142 E-Mail: mdemirer@mit.edu  Esther Duflo Department of Economics, E52-544 MIT 77 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02139 Tel: 617/258-7013 E-Mail: eduflo@mit.edu  Iván Fernández-Val Department of Economics Boston University 270 Bay State Rd Boston, MA 02215 E-Mail: ivanf@bu.edu",2018,"http://www.nber.org/papers/w24678","No. 24678","Jun-18",NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE
"JOUR","Based on recent developments in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), we examine what type of human labor will be a substitute versus a complement to emerging technologies. We argue that these recent developments reduce the costs of providing a particular set of tasks – prediction tasks. Prediction about uncertain states of the world is an input into decision-making. We show that prediction allows riskier decisions to be taken and this is its impact on observed productivity although it could also increase the variance of outcomes as well. We consider the role of human judgment in decision-making as prediction technology improves. Judgment is exercised when the objective function for a particular set of decisions cannot be described (i.e., coded). However, we demonstrate that better prediction impacts the returns to different types of judgment in opposite ways. Hence, not all human judgment will be a complement to AI. Finally, we show that humans will delegate some decisions to machines even when the decision would be superior with human input.",NA,"exploring the impact of artificial intelligence: prediction versus judgment","goldfarb, avi","10.3386/w24626","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w24626.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Ajay K.

"JOUR","There remains a puzzle around the world over why wage growth is so benign given the unemployment rate has returned to pre-recession levels.  It is our contention that a considerable part of the explanation is the rise in underemployment which rose in the Great Recession but has not returned to pre-recession levels even though the unemployment rate has.  Involuntary part-time employment rose in every advanced country and remains elevated in many in 2018.  In the UK we construct the Bell/Blanchflower underemployment index based on reports of whether workers, including full-timers and those who want to be part-time, who say they want to increase or decrease their hours at the going wage rate.  If they want to change their hours they report by how many.  Prior to 2008 our underemployment rate was below the unemployment rate.  Over the period 2001-2017 we find little change in the number of hours of workers who want fewer hours, but a big rise in the numbers wanting more hours.  Underemployment reduces wage pressure.  We also provide evidence that the UK Phillips Curve has flattened and conclude that the UK NAIRU has shifted down.  The underemployment rate likely would need to fall below 3%, compared to its current rate of 4.9% before wage growth is likely to reach pre-recession levels.

We distinguish between automation-oriented applications such as robotics and the potential for recent developments in “deep learning” to serve as a general-purpose method of invention, finding strong evidence of a “shift” in the importance of application-oriented learning research since 2009. We suggest that this is likely to lead to a significant substitution away from more routinized labor-intensive research towards research that takes advantage of the interplay between passively generated large datasets and enhanced prediction algorithms.  At the same time, the potential commercial rewards from mastering this mode of research are likely to usher in a period of racing, driven by powerful incentives for individual companies to acquire and control critical large datasets and application-specific algorithms.

"JOUR","We interpret recent developments in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) as improvements in prediction technology. In this paper, we explore the consequences of improved prediction in decision-making. To do so, we adapt existing models of decision-making under uncertainty to account for the process of determining payoffs. We label this process of determining the payoffs ‘judgment.’ There is a risky action, whose payoff depends on the state, and a safe action with the same payoff in every state. Judgment is costly; for each potential state, it requires thought on what the payoff might be. Prediction and judgment are complements as long as judgment is not too difficult. We show that in complex environments with a large number of potential states, the effect of improvements in prediction on the importance of judgment depend a great deal on whether the improvements in prediction enable automated decision-making. We discuss the implications of improved prediction in the face of complexity for automation, contracts, and firm boundaries.",NA,"prediction, judgment and complexity: a theory of decision making and artificial intelligence","goldfarb, avi","10.3386/w24243","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w24243.pdf","published as Ajay Agrawal, Joshua Gans, Avi Goldfarb.

"JOUR","We summarize a framework for the study of the implications of automation and AI on the demand for labor, wages, and employment. Our task-based framework emphasizes the displacement effect that automation creates as machines and AI replace labor in tasks that it used to perform. This displacement effect tends to reduce the demand for labor and wages. But it is counteracted by a productivity effect, resulting from the cost savings generated by automation, which increase the demand for labor in non-automated tasks. The productivity effect is complemented by additional capital accumulation and the deepening of automation (improvements of existing machinery), both of which further increase the demand for labor. These countervailing effects are incomplete. Even when they are strong, automation in- creases output per worker more than wages and reduce the share of labor in national income. The more powerful countervailing force against automation is the creation of new labor-intensive tasks, which reinstates labor in new activities and tends to increase the labor share to counterbalance the impact of automation. Our framework also highlights the constraints and imperfections that slow down the adjustment of the economy and the labor market to automation and weaken the resulting productivity gains from this transformation: a mismatch between the skill requirements of new technologies, and the possibility that automation is being introduced at an excessive rate, possibly at the expense of other productivity-enhancing technologies.",NA,"artificial intelligence, automation and work","restrepo, pascual","10.3386/w24196","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w24196.pdf","published as Daron Acemoglu, Pascual Restrepo.

This paper provides a taxonomy of the associated economic issues: First, we discuss the general conditions under which new technologies such as AI may lead to a Pareto improvement. Secondly, we delineate the two main channels through which inequality is affected – the surplus arising to innovators and redistributions arising from factor price changes. Third, we provide several simple economic models to describe how policy can counter these effects, even in the case of a “singularity” where machines come to dominate human labor. Under plausible conditions, non-distortionary taxation can be levied to compensate those who otherwise might lose. Fourth, we describe the two main channels through which technological progress may lead to technological unemployment – via efficiency wage effects and as a transitional phenomenon.

"JOUR","We investigate the relationship between GDP per capita, trade costs, demand, and income inequality between 1996 and 2011. Specifically we apply the aggregate AIDS-based gravity model as developed in Fajgelbaum and Khandelwal (2016) to a panel of 40 countries to generate a new measure of market potential. We then relate this measure of market potential to country level GDP per capita finding a significant positive relationship which performs better than CES-based measures of market potential. The AIDS model allows for non-homotheticities in demand and the possibility that nations produce goods with higher or lower income elasticities so that income inequality and GDP per capita matter for the direction of trade. CES-based market potential measures are typically only a function of overall income and trade costs, but in AIDS relative incomes and average incomes matter. We also go beyond this partial equilibrium relationship and explore the welfare effects of a unilateral decline in international trade costs. A 10% decline in import prices induces an average rise in welfare of 2% for importing countries. This effect is larger for smaller countries and depends in an interesting way on the income elasticity of demand for source and destination products.",NA,"geography, income, and trade in the 21st century","meissner, christopher m","10.3386/w24121","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w24121.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Dan Liu Shanghai University of Finance and Economics 421, School of Economics 111 Wuchuan Rd Shanghai, 200433 CHINA E-Mail: dnnliu@ucdavis.edu  Christopher M.

"JOUR","We live in an age of paradox. Systems using artificial intelligence match or surpass human level performance in more and more domains, leveraging rapid advances in other technologies and driving soaring stock prices. Yet measured productivity growth has declined by half over the past decade, and real income has stagnated since the late 1990s for a majority of Americans. We describe four potential explanations for this clash of expectations and statistics: false hopes, mismeasurement, redistribution, and implementation lags. While a case can be made for each, we argue that lags have likely been the biggest contributor to the paradox. The most impressive capabilities of AI, particularly those based on machine learning, have not yet diffused widely. More importantly, like other general purpose technologies, their full effects won’t be realized until waves of complementary innovations are developed and implemented. The required adjustment costs, organizational changes, and new skills can be modeled as a kind of intangible capital. A portion of the value of this intangible capital is already reflected in the market value of firms.

We use a machine learning algorithm to identify important potential social capital measures that best predict neighborhood-level variation in labor market networks. We find evidence suggesting that smaller and less centralized schools, and schools with fewer poor students, foster social capital that builds labor market networks, as does a larger Republican vote share. The presence of establishments in a number of non-profit oriented industries are identified as predictive of strong labor market networks, likely because they either provide public goods or facilitate social contacts.

We model A.I. as the latest form of automation, a broader process dating back more than 200 years. Electricity, internal combustion engines, and semiconductors facilitated automation in the last century, but A.I. now seems poised to automate many tasks once thought to be out of reach, from driving cars to making medical recommendations and beyond. How will this affect economic growth and the division of income between labor and capital? What about the potential emergence of “singularities” and “superintelligence,” concepts that animate many discussions in the machine intelligence community? How will the linkages between A.I. and growth be mediated by firm-level considerations, including organization and market structure? The goal throughout is to refine a set of critical questions about A.I. and economic growth and to contribute to shaping an agenda for the field. One theme that emerges is based on Baumol’s “cost disease” insight: growth may be constrained not by what we are good at but rather by what is essential and yet hard to improve.",NA,"artificial intelligence and economic growth","jones, charles i","10.3386/w23928","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w23928.pdf","published as Philippe Aghion, Benjamin F.

"JOUR","We study the welfare implications of personalized pricing, an extreme form of third-degree price discrimination implemented with machine learning for a large, digital firm. Using data from a unique randomized controlled pricing field experiment we train a demand model and conduct inference about the effects of personalized pricing on firm and consumer surplus. In a second experiment, we validate our predictions in the field. The initial experiment reveals unexercised market power that allows the firm to raise its price optimally, generating a 55% increase in profits. Personalized pricing improves the firm's expected posterior profits by an additional 19%, relative to the optimized uniform price, and by 86%, relative to the firm's unoptimized status quo price. Turning to welfare effects on the demand side, total consumer surplus declines 23% under personalized pricing relative to uniform pricing, and 47% relative to the firm's unoptimized status quo price. However, over 60% of consumers benefit from lower prices under personalization and total welfare can increase under standard inequity-averse welfare functions. Simulations with our demand estimates reveal a non-monotonic relationship between the granularity of the segmentation data and the total consumer surplus under personalization.

A breakdown of extramural citations by economics fields shows broad field impact. Differentiating between theoretical and empirical papers classified using machine learning, we see that much of the rise in economics’ extramural influence reflects growth in citations to empirical work.

"JOUR","We revisit the classic semiparametric problem of inference on a low dimensional parameter θ_0 in the presence of high-dimensional nuisance parameters η_0. We depart from the classical setting by allowing for η_0 to be so high-dimensional that the traditional assumptions, such as Donsker properties, that limit complexity of the parameter space for this object break down. To estimate η_0, we consider the use of statistical or machine learning (ML) methods which are particularly well-suited to estimation in modern, very high-dimensional cases. ML methods perform well by employing regularization to reduce variance and trading off regularization bias with overfitting in practice. However, both regularization bias and overfitting in estimating η_0 cause a heavy bias in estimators of θ_0 that are obtained by naively plugging ML estimators of η_0 into estimating equations for θ_0. This bias results in the naive estimator failing to be N^(-1/2) consistent, where N is the sample size. We show that the impact of regularization bias and overfitting on estimation of the parameter of interest θ_0 can be removed by using two simple, yet critical, ingredients: (1) using Neyman-orthogonal moments/scores that have reduced sensitivity with respect to nuisance parameters to estimate θ_0, and (2) making use of cross-fitting which provides an efficient form of data-splitting. We call the resulting set of methods double or debiased ML (DML). We verify that DML delivers point estimators that concentrate in a N^(-1/2)-neighborhood of the true parameter values and are approximately unbiased and normally distributed, which allows construction of valid confidence statements. The generic statistical theory of DML is elementary and simultaneously relies on only weak theoretical requirements which will admit the use of a broad array of modern ML methods for estimating the nuisance parameters such as random forests, lasso, ridge, deep neural nets, boosted trees, and various hybrids and ensembles of these methods. We illustrate the general theory by applying it to provide theoretical properties of DML applied to learn the main regression parameter in a partially linear regression model, DML applied to learn the coefficient on an endogenous variable in a partially linear instrumental variables model, DML applied to learn the average treatment effect and the average treatment effect on the treated under unconfoundedness, and DML applied to learn the local average treatment effect in an instrumental variables setting. In addition to these theoretical applications, we also illustrate the use of DML in three empirical examples.",NA,"double/debiased machine learning for treatment and structural parameters","robins, james","10.3386/w23564","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w23564.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Victor Chernozhukov Department of Economics Massachusetts Institute of Technology 77 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, Mass. 02139 E-Mail: vchern@mit.edu  Denis Chetverikov UCLA, Department of Economics 315 Portola Plaza Bunche Hall, Room 8283 Los Angeles, CA 90095-1477 E-Mail: chetverikov@econ.ucla.edu  Mert Demirer MIT Sloan School of Management 100 Main St Cambridge, MA 02142 E-Mail: mdemirer@mit.edu  Esther Duflo Department of Economics, E52-544 MIT 77 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02139 Tel: 617/258-7013 E-Mail: eduflo@mit.edu  Christian Hansen University of Chicago Booth School of Business 5807 South Woodlawn Avenue Chicago, IL 60637 E-Mail: chansen1@chicagobooth.edu  Whitney Newey Department of Economics, E52-424 MIT 77 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02139 Tel: 617/253-6420 Fax: 617/253-1330 E-Mail: wnewey@mit.edu  James Robins 677 Huntington Avenue Kresge Building Room 823 Boston, MA 02115 E-Mail: robins@hsph.harvard.edu",2017,"http://www.nber.org/papers/w23564","No. 23564","Jun-17",NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE
"JOUR","This paper reports the results of two randomized field experiments, each offering different populations of youth a supported summer job in Chicago. In both experiments, the program dramatically reduces violent-crime arrests, even after the summer. It does so without improving employment, schooling, or other types of crime; if anything, property crime increases over 2-3 post-program years. To explore mechanisms, we implement a machine learning method that predicts treatment heterogeneity using observables. The method identifies a subgroup of youth with positive employment impacts, whose characteristics differ from the disconnected youth served in most employment programs. We find that employment benefiters commit more property crime than their control counterparts, and non-benefiters also show a decline in violent crime. These results do not seem consistent with typical theory about improved human capital and better labor market opportunities creating a higher opportunity cost of crime, or even with the idea that these programs just keep youth busy. We discuss several alternative mechanisms, concluding that brief youth employment programs can generate substantively important behavioral change, but for different outcomes, different youth, and different reasons than those most often considered in the literature.",NA,"rethinking the benefits of youth employment programs: the heterogeneous effects of summer jobs","heller, sara b","10.3386/w23443","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w23443.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Jonathan M.V.

"JOUR","We examine how machine learning can be used to improve and understand human decision-making. In particular, we focus on a decision that has important policy consequences. Millions of times each year, judges must decide where defendants will await trial—at home or in jail. By law, this decision hinges on the judge’s prediction of what the defendant would do if released. This is a promising machine learning application because it is a concrete prediction task for which there is a large volume of data available.  Yet comparing the algorithm to the judge proves complicated. First, the data are themselves generated by prior judge decisions. We only observe crime outcomes for released defendants, not for those judges detained. This makes it hard to evaluate counterfactual decision rules based on algorithmic predictions. Second, judges may have a broader set of preferences than the single variable that the algorithm focuses on; for instance, judges may care about racial inequities or about specific crimes (such as violent crimes) rather than just overall crime risk. We deal with these problems using different econometric strategies, such as quasi-random assignment of cases to judges. Even accounting for these concerns, our results suggest potentially large welfare gains: a policy simulation shows crime can be reduced by up to 24.8% with no change in jailing rates, or jail populations can be reduced by 42.0% with no increase in crime rates. Moreover, we see reductions in all categories of crime, including violent ones. Importantly, such gains can be had while also significantly reducing the percentage of African-Americans and Hispanics in jail. We find similar results in a national dataset as well.  In addition, by focusing the algorithm on predicting judges’ decisions, rather than defendant behavior, we gain some insight into decision-making: a key problem appears to be that judges to respond to ‘noise’ as if it were signal. These results suggest that while machine learning can be valuable, realizing this value requires integrating these tools into an economic framework: being clear about the link between predictions and decisions; specifying the scope of payoff functions; and constructing unbiased decision counterfactuals.",NA,"human decisions and machine predictions","mullainathan, sendhil","10.3386/w23180","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w23180.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Jon Kleinberg Department of Computer Science Department of Information Science Cornell University Ithaca, NY 14853 E-Mail: kleinber@cs.cornell.edu  Himabindu Lakkaraju Morgan Hall Boston, MA 02163 USA E-Mail: himalv@stanford.edu  Jure Leskovec Gates Computer Science Building 353 Serra Mall Stanford, CA 94305 E-Mail: jure@cs.stanford.edu  Jens Ludwig Harris School of Public Policy University of Chicago 1307 East 60th Street Chicago, IL 60637 Tel: 773/834-0811 E-Mail: jludwig@uchicago.edu  Sendhil Mullainathan Booth School of Business University of Chicago 5807 South Woodlawn Avenue Chicago, IL 60637 Tel: 773/834-2353 E-Mail: sendhil.mullainathan@gmail.com",2017,"http://www.nber.org/papers/w23180","No. 23180","Feb-17",NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE

Attenuated deleveraging, with ML staying well above zero, is the norm at 3,118 firms that are delisted due to financial distress within four years of peak. Leverage is path dependent, with the key to explaining whether ML is high or low at the post-peak trough being how high it was at the peak and prior trough and whether the firm has had only a short time to deleverage, e.g., due to distress-related delisting.

"JOUR","We study the impacts of a rural development program designed to boost the income of the smallfarm sector in Nicaragua. Exploiting the random assignment of treatment, we find statistically and economically significant impacts on gross farm income and investment in productive farm capital. Using continuous treatment estimation techniques, we examine the evolution of program impacts over time and find that the estimated income increase persists and that the impacts on productive capital stock continue to rise even after the program concluded. Additionally, panel quantile methods reveal striking heterogeneity of program impacts on both income and investment. We show that this heterogeneity is not random and that there appear to exist low-performing household types who benefit little from the program, whereas high-performing (upper quantile) households benefit more substantially. Analysis using generalized random forests, a machine learning algorithm, points toward greater program impacts for households who were disadvantaged at baseline. Even after controlling for this source of heterogeneity, we find large and persistent differences in how much different types of households benefited from the program. While the benefit-cost ratio of the program is on average positive, the impact heterogeneity suggests that business development programs aiming to engage farm households as agricultural entrepreneurs have limitations as instruments to eliminate rural poverty.",NA,"heterogeneous impact dynamics of a rural business development program in nicaragua","toledo, patricia","10.3386/w22628","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w22628.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Michael Carter Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics University of California, Davis One Shields Avenue Davis, CA 95616 Tel: 530/752-4672 Fax: 530/752-5614 E-Mail: mrcarter@ucdavis.edu  Emilia Tjernström Australia E-Mail: emilia.tjernstrom@monash.edu  Patricia Toledo Department of Economics Bentley Annex 345 Athens, Ohio 45701 E-Mail: toledot@ohio.edu",2016,"http://www.nber.org/papers/w22628","No. 22628","Sep-16",NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE
"JOUR","Behavioral economists have recently put forth a theoretical explanation for the equity premium puzzle based on combining myopia and loss aversion.  Complementing the behavioral theory is evidence from laboratory experiments, which provide strong empirical support consistent with myopic loss aversion (MLA).  Yet, whether, and to what extent, such preferences underlie behaviors of traders in their natural domain remains unknown.  Indeed, a necessary condition for the MLA theory to explain the equity premium puzzle is for marginal traders in markets to exhibit such preferences.  Using minute-by-minute trading observations from over 864,000 price realizations in a natural field experiment, we find data patterns consonant with MLA:  in their normal course of business, professional traders who receive infrequent price information invest 33% more in risky assets, yielding profits that are 53% higher, compared to traders who receive frequent price information.

"JOUR","A substantial amount of money is spent on technology by schools, families and policymakers with the hope of improving educational outcomes. This paper explores the theoretical and empirical literature on the impacts of technology on educational outcomes. The literature focuses on two primary contexts in which technology may be used for educational purposes: i) classroom use in schools, and ii) home use by students. Theoretically, ICT investment and CAI use by schools and the use of computers at home have ambiguous implications for educational achievement: expenditures devoted to technology necessarily offset inputs that may be more or less efficient, and time allocated to using technology may displace traditional classroom instruction and educational activities at home. However, much of the evidence in the schooling literature is based on interventions that provide supplemental funding for technology or additional class time, and thus favor finding positive effects. Nonetheless, studies of ICT and CAI in schools produce mixed evidence with a pattern of null results. Notable exceptions to this pattern occur in studies of developing countries and CAI interventions that target math rather than language. In the context of home use, early studies based on multivariate and instrumental variables approaches tend to find large positive (and in a few cases negative) effects while recent studies based on randomized control experiments tend to find small or null effects.

"JOUR","The 2011 America Invents Act was the most significant reform to the United States patent system in over fifty years. However, the AIA did not address a number of major problems associated with patent litigation in the United States. In this paper, we provide an economic analysis of post-AIA developments relating to Patent Assertion Entities (PAEs) and Standard-Essential Patents (SEPs). For PAEs and SEPs, we examine the alignment, or lack of alignment, between the rewards provided to patent holders and their social contributions. Our report is mixed. Regarding PAEs, we see significantly improved alignment between rewards and contributions, largely due to a series of rulings by the Supreme Court. Legislation currently under consideration in Congress would further limit certain litigation tactics used by PAEs that generate rewards unrelated to contribution. We also see some notable developments relating to SEPs, especially with the recent reform to the patent policies of the IEEE, a leading Standard-Setting Organization (SSO) and with several recent court decisions clarifying what constitutes a Fair, Reasonable and Non-Discriminatory (FRAND) royalty rate. However, other steps that could better align rewards with contributions on the SEP front have largely stalled out, particularly because other major SSOs do not seem poised to follow the lead of the IEEE.

"JOUR","Culture is a potent force in shaping individual and group behavior, yet it has received scant attention in the context of financial risk management and the recent financial crisis. I present a brief overview of the role of culture according to psychologists, sociologists, and economists, and then present a specific framework for analyzing culture in the context of financial practices and institutions in which three questions are answered: (1) What is culture?; (2) Does it matter?; and (3) Can it be changed? I illustrate the utility of this framework by applying it to five concrete situations—Long Term Capital Management; AIG Financial Products; Lehman Brothers and Repo 105; Société Générale’s rogue trader; and the SEC and the Madoff Ponzi scheme—and conclude with a proposal to change culture via “behavioral risk management.”",NA,"the gordon gekko effect: the role of culture in the financial industry","lo, andrew w","10.3386/w21267","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w21267.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Andrew W.

"JOUR","The gravity equation for trade flows is one of the most successful empirical models in economics and has long played a central role in the trade literature (Anderson, 2011). Different approaches to estimate the gravity equation, i.e. reduced-form or more structural, have been proposed. This paper examines the role of adding-up constraints as the key difference between structural gravity with ""multilateral resistance"" indexes and reduced-form gravity with simple fixed effects by exporter and importer. In particular, estimating gravity equations using the Poisson Pseudo-Maximum-Likelihood Estimator (Poisson PML) with fixed effects automatically satisfies these constraints and is consistent with the introduction of ""multilateral resistance"" indexes as in Anderson and van Wincoop (2003).",NA,"structural gravity and fixed effects","fally, thibault","10.3386/w21212","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w21212.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Thibault Fally Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics University of California, Berkeley Giannini Hall, 207 Berkeley, CA 94720-3310 Tel: 720/237-6158 E-Mail: fally@berkeley.edu",2015,"http://www.nber.org/papers/w21212","No. 21212","May-15",NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE
"JOUR","In this paper, we propose a method for finding policy function improvements for a single agent in high-dimensional Markov dynamic optimization problems, focusing in particular on dynamic games. Our approach combines ideas from literatures in Machine Learning and the econometric analysis of games to derive a one-step improvement policy over any given benchmark policy. In order to reduce the dimensionality of the game, our method selects a parsimonious subset of state variables in a data-driven manner using a Machine Learning estimator. This one-step improvement policy can in turn be improved upon until a suitable stopping rule is met as in the classical policy function iteration approach. We illustrate our algorithm in a high-dimensional entry game similar to that studied by Holmes (2011) and show that it results in a nearly 300 percent improvement in expected profits as compared with a benchmark policy.",NA,"improving policy functions in high-dimensional dynamic games","bajari, patrick","10.3386/w21124","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w21124.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Carlos A.

"JOUR","The near-failure on September 16, 2008, of American International Group (AIG) was an iconic moment in the financial crisis. Two large bets on real estate made with funding that was vulnerable to bank-run like behavior on the part of funders pushed AIG to the brink of bankruptcy. AIG used securities lending to transform insurance company assets into residential mortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations, ultimately losing at least $21 billion and threatening the solvency of the life insurance companies. AIG also sold insurance on multi-sector collateralized debt obligations, backed by real estate assets, ultimately losing more than $30 billion. These activities were apparently motivated by a belief that AIG’s real estate bets would not suffer defaults and were “money-good.” We find that these securities have in fact suffered write-downs and that the stark “money-good” claim can be rejected.

Prior research shows that CDHPs reduce spending in the first year. However, there is little research on the impact of CDHPs over the longer term.  We add to this literature by using data from 13 million individuals in 54 large US firms to estimate the effects of a firm offering CDHPs on health care spending up to three years post offer. We use a difference-in-differences analysis and to further strengthen identification, we balance observables within firm, over time by developing weights through a machine learning algorithm. We find that spending is reduced for those in firms offering CDHPs in all three years post.

"JOUR","We survey and apply several techniques from the statistical and computer science literature to the problem of demand estimation. We derive novel asymptotic properties for several of these models. To improve out-of-sample prediction accuracy and obtain parametric rates of convergence, we propose a method of combining the underlying models via linear regression. Our method has several appealing features: it is robust to a large number of potentially-collinear regressors; it scales easily to very large data sets; the machine learning methods combine model selection and estimation; and the method can flexibly approximate arbitrary non-linear functions, even when the set of regressors is high dimensional and we also allow for fixed effects.  We illustrate our method using a standard scanner panel data set to estimate promotional lift and find that our estimates are considerably more accurate in out of sample predictions of demand than some commonly used alternatives.

"JOUR","Recent evaluations of traditional microfinance loans have found no significant impacts on borrower incomes or productive activities. We examine whether this can be remedied by (a) modifying loan features to facilitate financing of working capital needs of farmers, and (b) delegating selection of borrowers for individual liability loans to local trader-lender agents incentivized by repayment-based commissions. We conduct a field experiment in West Bengal where this design (called TRAIL) was offered in randomly selected villages. In remaining villages a more traditional design (called GBL) was offered, wherein five-member groups applied for joint liability loans with terms otherwise similar to TRAIL loans. TRAIL loans increased cultivation of potatoes (the major cash crop in the region) and farm incomes by 17–21%, whereas GBL loans had insignificant and highly dispersed effects. We argue this was because TRAIL agents selected borrowers that were low-risk and highly productive, whereas the GBL scheme attracted farmers that were riskier on average and highly heterogeneous in terms of productivity.

"JOUR","This paper examines the distributional implications of introducing additional means testing of Social Security benefits where proceeds are used to help balance Social Security's finances. Benefits of the top quarter of households ranked according to the relevant measure of means are reduced using a modified version of the Social Security Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP). The replacement rate in the first bracket of the benefit formula, determining the Primary Insurance Amount (PIA), would be reduced from 90 percent to 40 percent of Average Indexed Monthly Earnings (AIME). Four measures of means are considered: total wealth; an annualized measure of AIME; the wealth value of pensions; and a measure of average indexed lifetime W2 earnings. The empirical analysis is based on data from the Health and Retirement Study. These means tests would reduce total lifetime household benefits by 7 to 9 percentage points. We find that the basis for means testing Social Security makes a substantial difference as to which households have their benefits reduced, and that different means tests may have different effects on the benefits of families in similar circumstance. We also find that the measure of means used to evaluate the effects of a means test makes a considerable difference as to how one would view the effects of the means test on the distribution of benefits.",NA,"distributional effects of means testing social security: an exploratory analysis","tabatabai, nahid","10.3386/w20546","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w20546.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Alan L.

"JOUR","Forecasts for the two or three years after mid-2014 have converged on growth rates of real GDP in the range of 3.0 to 3.5 percent, a major stepwise increase from realized growth of 2.1 percent between mid-2009 and mid-2014.  However, these forecasts are based on the demand for goods and services.  Less attention has been paid to how the accelerated growth of real GDP will be supplied.  Will the unemployment rate, which has declined at roughly one percent per year, decline even faster from 6.1 percent in June, 2014 to 3.0 percent or below in 2017?  Will the supply-side support for the demand-side optimism be provided instead by a major rebound of productivity growth from the average of 1.2 percent over the past decade and 0.6 percent for the last four years, or perhaps by a reversal of the minus 0.8 percent growth rate since 2007 of the labor-force participation rate?  The paper develops a new and surprisingly simple method of calculating the growth rate of potential GDP over the next decade and concludes that projections of potential output growth for the same decade in the most recent reports of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) are much too optimistic.  If the projections in this paper are close to the mark, the level of potential GDP in 2024 will be almost 10 percent below the CBO's current forecast.  Further, the new potential GDP series implies that the debt/GDP ratio in 2024 will be closer to 87 percent than the CBO's current forecast of 78 percent.      This paper also has profound implications for the Federal Reserve.  The unemployment rate has declined rapidly, particularly within the last year.  Faster real GDP growth will accelerate the decline in the unemployment rate and soon reduce it beyond any estimate of the constant-inflation NAIRU, even if productivity growth experiences a rebound and the labor force participation rate stabilizes.

A growing body of empirical literature has shown the positive impact of clusters on regional and industry performance, including job creation, patenting, and new business formation. There is an increasing need for cluster-based data to support research, facilitate comparisons of clusters across regions, and support policymakers and practitioners in defining regional strategies. This paper develops a novel clustering algorithm that systematically generates and assesses sets of cluster definitions (i.e., groups of closely related industries). We implement the algorithm using 2009 data for U.S. industries (6-digit NAICS), and propose a new set of benchmark cluster definitions that incorporates measures of inter-industry linkages based on co-location patterns, input-output links, and similarities in labor occupations. We also illustrate the algorithm's ability to compare alternative sets of cluster definitions by evaluating our new set against existing sets in the literature.

The second, joint maximum likelihood (JML), estimator treats the degree heterogeneity ` {A_(i0)}_(i=1)^N` as additional (incidental) parameters to be estimated.

"JOUR","The Phillips Curve (hereafter PC) is widely viewed as dead, destined to the mortuary scrapyard of discarded economic ideas. The coroner's evidence consists of the small standard deviation of the core inflation rate in the past two decades despite substantial volatility of the unemployment rate, and in particular the common tendency of PC inflation equations to predict ever greater amounts of negative inflation (i.e., deflation) over the years of labor-market slack since 2008, sometimes called ""the case of the missing deflation"". The apparent failure of the PC deprives the Fed of a means of estimating the natural rate of unemployment (or NAIRU), and thus the Fed is steering the economy in a fog with no navigational device to determine the size of the unemployment gap, one of the two primary goals of its ""dual mandate."" The results of this paper contain important new information for Fed policymakers, for Fed-watchers, and almost everyone else in the community of policy-makers and practitioners of applied macro.  The greatest failure in the history of the PC occurred not within the past five years but rather in the mid-1970s, when the predicted negative relation between inflation and unemployment turned out to be utterly wrong. Instead inflation exhibited a strong positive correlation with unemployment. Failure bred success, as a revolution in thinking rebuilt macroeconomics to be not just about demand, but also about supply. By 1980 diagrams of shifting demand and supply curves had appeared in most macroeconomics textbooks. An econometric model of the inflation rate developed in 1982, soon dubbed the ""triangle model"", incorporated explicit variables for supply shifts and has successfully tracked inflation behavior since then.  The triangle model shows that the puzzle of missing deflation is in fact no puzzle. It can estimate coefficients up to 1996 and then in a 16-year-long dynamic simulation, with no information on the actual values of lagged inflation, predict the 2013:Q1 value of inflation to within 0.50 of a percentage point. The slope of the PC relationship between inflation and unemployment does not decline by half or more, as in the recent literature, but instead is stable. The model's simulation success is furthered here by recognizing the greater impact on inflation of short-run unemployment (spells of 26 weeks or less) than of long-run unemployment. The implied NAIRU for the total unemployment rate has risen since 2007 from 4.8 to 6.5 percent, raising new challenges for the Fed's ability to carry out its dual mandate.",NA,"the phillips curve is alive and well: inflation and the nairu during the slow recovery","gordon, robert j","10.3386/w19390","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w19390.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Robert J.

"JOUR","This paper sheds light on previous inconsistencies identified in the literature regarding the relationship between medical marijuana laws (MML) and recreational marijuana use by closely examining the importance of policy dimensions (registration requirements, home cultivation, dispensaries) and the timing of them. Using data from our own legal analysis of state MMLs, we evaluate which features are associated with adult and youth recreational use by linking these policy variables to data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY97), the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) and the Treatment Episodes Data System (TEDS). Our analyses control for state and year fixed effects, using within state policy changes over time to estimate the effect on changes in our outcome variables using a difference-in-differences approach. We find that while simple dichotomous indicators are generally not associated with marijuana use, specific dimensions of MMLs, namely home cultivation and legal dispensaries, are positively associated with marijuana use in each data set. Moreover, these same dimensions are tied to binge drinking and fatal alcohol automobile accidents as well. The findings have important implications for states considering legalization of marijuana, as regulating access to and promotion of dispensaries may be key for reducing the harms associated with these policies.",NA,"assessing the effects of medical marijuana laws on marijuana and alcohol use: the devil is in the details","sevigny, eric l","10.3386/w19302","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w19302.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Rosalie Liccardo Pacula Sol Price School of Public Policy and Schaeffer Center for Health Policy & Economics University of Southern California 635 Downey Way, VPD 514J Los Angeles, CA 90089 Tel: 213/821-8887 E-Mail: rmp_302@usc.edu  David Powell RAND Corporation 1776 Main Street P.O.

"JOUR","We use data from Sierra Leone where a substantial education program provided increased access to education for primary-school age children but did not benefit children who were older.  We exploit the variation in access to the program generated by date of birth and the variation in resources between various districts of the country. We find that the program has increased educational attainment and that an increase in education has changed women's preferences.  An increase in schooling, triggered by the program, had an impact on women's attitudes towards matters that impact women's health and on attitudes regarding violence against women. An increase in education has also reduced the number of desired children by women and increased their propensity to use modern contraception and to be tested for AIDS. While education makes women more intolerant of practices that conflict with their well-being, increased education has no impact on men's attitudes towards women's well-being.",NA,"empowering women through education: evidence from sierra leone","cannonier, colin","10.3386/w18016","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w18016.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Naci H.

"JOUR","HIV-prevention strategies have yielded only limited success so far in slowing down the AIDS epidemic. This paper examines novel intervention strategies that use incentives to discourage risky sexual behaviors. Widely-adopted conditional cash transfer programs that offer payments conditioning on easily monitored behaviors, such as well-child health care visits have shown positive impact on health outcomes. Similarly, contingency management approaches have successfully used outcome-based rewards to encourage behaviors that aren't easily monitored, such as stopping drug abuse. These strategies have not been used in the sexual domain, so we assess how incentives can be used to reduce risky sexual behavior. After discussing theoretical pathways, we discuss  the use of sexual-behavior incentives in the Tanzanian RESPECT trial.  There, participants who tested negative for sexually transmitted infections are eligible for  outcome-based cash rewards.  The trial was well-received in the communities, with high enrollment rates and over 90% of participants viewing the incentives favorably.  After one year, 57% of enrollees in the ""low-value"" reward arm stated that the cash rewards ""very much"" motivated sexual behavioral change, rising to 79% in the ""high-value"" reward arm.    Despite its controversial nature, we argue for further testing of such incentive-based approaches to encouraging reductions in risky sexual behavior.",NA,"stimulating demand for aids prevention: lessons from the respect trial","nathan, rose","10.3386/w17865","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w17865.pdf","published as Damien de Walque, William H.

"JOUR","This paper analyzes determinants of ex-manufacturer prices for originator and generic drugs across a large sample of countries. We focus on drugs to treat HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria in middle and low income countries (MLICs), with robustness checks to other therapeutic categories and other countries. We examine effects of per capita income, income dispersion, number and type of therapeutic and generic competitors, and whether the drugs are sold to retail pharmacies vs. tendered procurement by NGOs.   The cross-national income elasticity of prices is 0.4 across high and low income countries, but is only 0.15 between MLICs, implying that drugs are least affordable relative to income in the lowest income countries. Within-country income inequality contributes to relatively high prices in MLICs. Number of therapeutic and generic competitors only weakly affects prices to retail pharmacies, plausibly because uncertain quality leads to competition on brand rather than price. Tendered procurement attracts multi-national generic suppliers and significantly reduces prices for originators and generics, compared to prices to retail pharmacies.",NA,"pharmaceutical pricing in emerging markets: effects of income, competition and procurement","towse, adrian k","10.3386/w17174","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w17174.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Patricia M.

"JOUR","There is considerable debate about the impact of health care reform on the growth in medical spending.  Medical innovation is thought to be a central contributor to that growth. We argue that there is a unique linkage between reforms that affect output markets for medical care and medical R&D costs.  This linkage is due to the fact that potential consumers of medical care are also potential participants in clinical trials that are required to develop new medical products.  Therefore, reforms that increase the quality or reduce the price of already developed treatments reduce the incentive of patients to participate in trials of experimental treatments.  This delays development and reduce the returns to in innovation.  We provide evidence of this ""subject market effect"" by considering the impact of changes in the quality of conventional care on development.  We document a dramatic drop in trial recruitment following introduction of break-through HIV/AIDS therapies in 1996.  We conclude by discussing additional positive and normative implications of the subject market effect that link input and output markets for medical products.",NA,"can medical progress be sustained?  implications of the link between development and output markets","philipson, tomas j","10.3386/w17011","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w17011.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Anup Malani University of Chicago Law School 1111 E. 60th Street Chicago, IL 60637 Tel: 773/702-9602 E-Mail: amalani@uchicago.edu  Tomas Philipson Irving B.

"JOUR","Poverty and altered planning horizons brought on by the HIV/AIDS epidemic can change individual discount rates, altering incentives to conserve natural resources.  Using longitudinal data from household surveys in western Kenya, we estimate impacts of health status on labor productivity and discount rates.  We find that household size and composition are predictors of whether the effect on productivity dominates the discount rate effect, or vice-versa.  Since households with more and younger members are better able to reallocate labor to cope with productivity shocks, the discount rate impact dominates for these households and health improvements lead to greater levels of conservation.  In smaller families with less substitutable labor, the productivity impact dominates and health improvements lead to greater environmental degradation.",NA,"health shocks and natural resource management:  evidence from western kenya","thirumurthy, harsha","10.3386/w16594","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w16594.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Joshua S.

I find that binge drinking significantly increases participation in sex, promiscuity, and the failure to use birth control, albeit by amounts considerably smaller than implied by merely conditioning on exogenous factors. For all outcomes, impacts rise substantially with binge drinking frequency. Results are similar using alternative comparison groups defined by excluding those who do not exhibit other risky behaviors, and by gender and race/ethnicity, but vary by grade level and over time in different ways for engaging in sex than protective behavior.

This ""score bootstrap"" procedure avoids recomputing the estimator in each bootstrap iteration, making it substantially less costly to compute than the conventional nonparametric bootstrap, particularly in complex nonlinear models. Despite this computational advantage, in the linear model, the score bootstrap studentized test statistic is equivalent to that of the conventional wild bootstrap up to order `O_p(n^(-1))`. We establish the consistency of the procedure for Wald and Lagrange Multiplier type tests and tests of moment restrictions for a wide class of M-estimators under clustering and potential misspecification.

"JOUR","Conventional trade theory, which combines the Heckscher-Ohlin theory and the Stolper-Samuelson theorem, implies that expanded trade between developed and developing countries will increase wage inequality in the developed countries. This theory is widely applied. It serves as the basis for estimating the impact of trade on wages using two-sector simulation models and the net factor content of trade. It leads naturally to the presumption that the rapid growth and declining relative prices of US manufactured imports from developing countries since the 1990s have been a powerful source of increased US wage inequality.   In this study we present evidence that suggests the presumption is not warranted. We highlight the sensitivity of conventional theory to the assumption of incomplete specialization and find evidence that is not consistent with it. Since 1987, although US domestic relative effective prices in industries with relatively high shares of manufactured goods imports from developing countries have declined, effective unskilled worker-weighted prices have actually risen relative to skilled worker-weighted prices. If anything, this suggests pressures for increased wage equality. Also in apparent contradiction to theory, the (six-digit North American Industry Classification System [NAICS]) US manufacturing industries with high shares of manufactured imports from developing countries are actually more skill intensive than the industries with high shares of imports from developed countries. Finally, applying a two-stage regression procedure, we find that developing-country import price changes have not mandated increased US wage inequality. While these results conflict with standard theory, they are easily explained if the United States and developing countries have specialized in products and tasks that are highly imperfect substitutes. If this is the case, the impact of increased trade with developing countries on US wage inequality is far more muted than standard theory suggests. Also methodologies such as the net factor content of trade using US production coefficients and simulation models assuming perfect substitution between imports and domestic products could be highly misleading.",NA,"us trade and wages: the misleading implications of conventional trade theory","lawrence, robert z","10.3386/w16106","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w16106.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Lawrence Edwards School of Economics University of Cape Town Cape Town  Republic of South Africa E-Mail: Lawrence.Edwards@uct.ac.za  Robert Z.

This paper uses disaggregated data on U.S. imports and exports to shed light on the anatomy of this collapse. We find that the recent reduction in trade relative to overall economic activity is far larger than in previous downturns. Information on quantities and prices of both domestic absorption and imports reveals a 40% shortfall in imports, relative to what would be predicted by a simple import demand relationship. In a sample of imports and exports disaggregated at the 6-digit NAICS level, we find that sectors used as intermediate inputs experienced significantly higher percentage reductions in both imports and exports. We also find support for compositional effects: sectors with larger reductions in domestic output had larger drops in trade.

"JOUR","Despite recent international efforts to increase antiretroviral treatment (ART) coverage, it is estimated that more than 5 million people who need ART in developing countries do not receive such treatment. Shortages of human resources to treat HIV/AIDS (HRHA) are one of the main constraints to scaling up ART.  We develop a discrete-time Markovian model to project the numbers of HRHA required to achieve universal ART coverage, taking into account the positive feedback from HRHA numbers to future HRHA need. Feedback occurs because ART is effective in prolonging the lives of HIV-positive people who need treatment, so that an increase in the number of people receiving treatment leads to an increase in the number of people needing it in future periods.  We investigate the steady-state behavior of our model and apply it to different regions in the developing world. We find that taking into account the feedback from the current supply of HRHA to the future HRHA need substantially increases the projected numbers of HRHA required to achieve universal ART coverage.

The second is the average quality of practicing physicians, defined as the fraction of physicians that were trained at top-ranked medical schools.  The third is the mean vintage (FDA approval year) of outpatient and inpatient prescription drugs. Life expectancy increased more rapidly in states where (1) the fraction of Medicare diagnostic imaging procedures that were advanced procedures increased more rapidly; (2) the vintage of self- and provider-administered drugs increased more rapidly; and (3) the quality of medical schools previously attended by physicians increased more rapidly.

"JOUR","We use data from the Gallup World Poll and from the Demographic and Health Surveys to investigate how subjective wellbeing (SWB) is affected by mortality in sub-Saharan Africa, including mortality from HIV/AIDS. The Gallup data provide direct evidence on Africans' own emotional and evaluative responses to high levels of infection and of mortality. By comparing the effect of mortality on SWB with the effect of income on SWB, we can attach monetary values to mortality to illuminate the often controversial question of how to value life in Africa. Large fractions of the respondents in the World Poll report the mortality of an immediate family member in the last twelve months, with malaria typically more important than AIDS, and deaths of women in childbirth more important than deaths from AIDS in many countries. A life evaluation measure (Cantril's ladder of life) is relatively insensitive to the deaths of immediate family, which suggests a low value of life. There are much larger effects on experiential measures, such as sadness and depression, which suggest much larger values of life.

"JOUR","Intertemporal tradability allows an emissions market to reduce abatement costs.  We study intertemporal trading of nitrogen oxides permits in the RECLAIM program in Southern California.  A theoretical model captures the program's key intertemporal features: two overlapping permit cycles, two compliance cycles for facilities, and tradable permits.  We characterize the competitive equilibrium; show that it is cost effective; and demonstrate the firms' incentive to delay abatement, i.e., to trade intertemporally.  Using model extensions to explore market design issues, an arbitrage condition implies that the equilibrium is invariant to overlapping compliance cycles, but depends crucially on overlapping permit cycles. We empirically investigate intertemporal trading of permits using panel data on RECLAIM facilities for 1994-2006.  Facilities undertake trading by using a considerable proportion of permits of the opposite cycle.

"JOUR","The historical pattern of the demographic transition suggests that fertility declines follow mortality declines, followed by a rise in human capital accumulation and economic growth. The HIV/AIDS epidemic threatens to reverse this path. A recent paper by Young (2005), however, suggests that similar to the ""Black Death"" episode in Europe, HIV/AIDS will actually lead to higher growth per capita among the affected African countries. Not only will population decline, behavioral responses in fertility will reinforce this decline by reducing the willingness to engage in unprotected sex. We utilize recent rounds of the Demographic and Health Surveys which link an individual woman's fertility outcomes to her HIV status based on testing. The data allows us to distinguish the effect of own positive HIV status on fertility (which may be due to lower fecundity and other physiological reasons) from the behavioral response to higher mortality risk, as measured by the local community HIV prevalence. We show that HIV-infected women have significantly lower fertility.

We examine whether changes in minimum drinking age (MLDA) laws affect the likelihood of poor birth outcomes. Using data from the National Vital Statistics (NVS) for the years 1978-88, we find that a drinking age of 18 is associated with adverse outcomes among births to young mothers -- including higher incidences of low birth weight and premature birth, but not congenital malformations.  The effects are largest among black women.  We find suggestive evidence from both the NVS and the 1979 National Longitudinal Study of Youth (NLSY) that the MLDA laws alter the composition of births that occur.  In states with lenient drinking laws, young black mothers are more likely to have used alcohol 12 months prior to the birth of their child and less likely to report paternal information on the birth certificate.

"JOUR","This paper measures the effects of real estate brokerage services provided to sellers, other than MLS listings, on the terms and timing of home sales. It is not obvious that sellers benefit from those services. On the one hand, brokers offer potentially useful knowledge and expertise. On the other hand, because the relationship between the homeowner and the broker resembles a classical principal-agent problem, the broker may not deploy services in ways that promote the seller's interests. Yet as long as valuable MLS listings are bundled with brokerage services, homeowners may use brokers even if the agency costs exceed the benefits of brokers' knowledge and expertise. Thus, quantification of the net value of brokerage services other than MLS listings bears directly on the recent policy debate over the desirability unbundling of MLS listings. We estimate the effect of a seller's decision to use a broker on list prices, selling prices, and speed of sale for a real estate market with an unusual and critical characteristic: it has a single open-access listing service that is used by essentially all sellers, regardless of whether they employ brokers. Our central finding is that, when listings are not tied to brokerage services, a seller's use of a broker reduces the selling price of the typical home by 5.9 to 7.7 percent, which indicates that agency costs exceed the advantages of brokers' knowledge and expertise by a wide margin.",NA,"do real estate brokers add value when listing services are unbundled?","meer, jonathan","10.3386/w13796","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w13796.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: B.

"JOUR","The biotechnology industry has been an engine of innovation for the U.S. healthcare system and, more generally, the U.S. economy. It is by far the most research intensive industry in the U.S. In our analyses in the current paper, for example, we find that, over the past 25 years, average R&D intensity (R&D spending to total firm assets) for this industry was 38 percent. Consider that over this same period average R&D intensity for all industries was only about 3 percent.   In the current paper we examine this industry along a number of dimensions and estimate its average financial risk. Specifically, we use Compustat and Center for Research in Securities Prices (CRSP) data from 1982 to 2005 for firms defined by the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) as biotechnology firms to estimate several Fama-French three factor return models. The finance literature has established this model as the gold standard. Single factor models like the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) do not capture all of the types of systematic risk that influence  firm cost of capital. In particular, the CAPM does not reflect the empirical evidence that supports both a size-related and a book-to-market related systematic risk factor . Both of these factors, based on biotech industry characteristics, will exert a greater influence on biotech firms, on average. Another implication is, of course, that cost of capital estimates for the industry will be underestimated when a single factor model, like the CAPM, is used. This also implies that the cost estimates of bringing a new drug and/or biologic to market will be understated if financial risk and cost of capital are measured using a single-factor model.   In the current study we find that biotechnology firms are exposed to greater financial risk than other industries and are also more sensitive to policy shocks that affect, or could affect, industry profitability. Average nominal costs of capital over the 1982-2005 time period were 16.25 percent for biotechnology firms. Of course, these average estimates obscure significant variation in financial risk at the firm level, but nonetheless shed light on some interesting aggregate differences in risk. In the current paper we discuss the theoretical links between financial risk, stock prices and returns, and R&D spending. Several caveats are also discussed.",NA,"financial risk in the biotechnology industry","vernon, john a","10.3386/w13604","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w13604.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Joseph Golec Department of Finance 2100 Hillside Road Storrs, CT 06269 E-Mail: Joseph.Golec@business.uconn.edu  John Vernon University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Department of Health Policy & Management 1101C McGavran-Greenberg Hall Chapel Hill, NC 27599-7411 Tel: 919/966-8930 E-Mail: no email available",2007,"http://www.nber.org/papers/w13604","No. 13604","Nov-07",NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE

We estimate the impact of ARV treatment on children's schooling and nutrition outcomes using longitudinal household survey data collected in collaboration with a treatment program in western Kenya.  We find that children's weekly hours of school attendance increase by over 20 percent within six months after treatment is initiated for the adult household member.  For boys in treatment households, these increases closely follow their reduced market labor supply.  Similarly, young children's short-term nutritional status--as measured by their weight-for-height Z-score--also improves dramatically.  We argue that these treatment effects will be considerably larger when compared to the counterfactual scenario of no ARV treatment.  The results provide evidence on how intrahousehold resource allocation is altered in response to significant health improvements.  Since the improvements in children's schooling and nutrition at these critical early ages will affect their socio-economic outcomes in adulthood, the widespread provision of ARV treatment is likely to generate significant long-run macroeconomic benefits.",NA,"aids treatment and intrahousehold resource allocations: children's nutrition and schooling in kenya","goldstein, markus","10.3386/w12689","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w12689.pdf",NA,NA,"presented at ""Health Care Program Meeting"", October 20, 2006","Author contact info: Joshua S.

"JOUR","The spread of the HIV/AIDS epidemic is still fueled by ignorance in many parts of the world. Filling in knowledge gaps, particularly between men and women, is considered key to preventing future infections and to reducing female vulnerabilities to the disease. However, such knowledge is arguably only a necessary condition for targeting these objectives. In this paper, we describe the extent to which HIV/AIDS knowledge is correlated with less risky sexual behavior. We ask: even when there are no substantial knowledge gaps between men and women, do we still observe sex-specific differentials in sexual behavior that would increase vulnerability to infection? We use data from two recent household surveys in Botswana to address this question. We show that even when men and women have very similar types of knowledge, they have different probabilities of reporting safe sex. Our findings are consistent with the existence of non-informational barriers to behavioral change, some of which appear to be sex-specific. The descriptive exercise in this paper suggests that it may be overly optimistic to hope for reductions in risky behavior through the channel of HIV-information provision alone.",NA,"when knowledge is not enough:  hiv/aids information and risky behavior in botswana","majelantle, rolang","10.3386/w12418","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w12418.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: James A.

"JOUR","We estimate the medical cost per life-year gained from increased utilization of HIV drugs by estimating the impact of increased drug utilization on the life expectancy and drug and hospital expenditure of HIV/AIDS patients, using aggregate (U.S. national-level) data for the period 1982-2001. We use IMS Health data on the aggregate number of and expenditure on HIV drug prescriptions, the CDC's AIDS Public Information Data Set, and data from AHRQ's Nationwide Inpatient Sample. 	Estimates of mortality models imply that actual life expectancy of HIV/AIDS patients in 2001 was 13.4 years higher than it would have been if the drug utilization rate had not increased from its 1993 level. Estimates of a model of hospital discharges imply that increased utilization of HIV drugs caused hospital utilization to decline by .25 to .29 discharges per person per year during the period 1993-2001. Medical cost per additional life-year is estimated to have been $17,175. 	Treatments that cost this amount are widely considered to be cost-effective.

"JOUR","Given the rapid growth in health care spending that is often attributed to technological change, many private and public institutions are grappling with how to best assess and adopt new health care technologies. The leading technology adoption criteria proposed in theory and used in practice involve so called ""cost-effectiveness"" measures. However, little is known about the dynamic efficiency implications of such criteria, in particular how they influence the R&D investments that make technologies available in the first place. We argue that such criteria implicitly concern maximizing consumer surplus, which many times is consistent with maximizing static efficiency after an innovation has been developed. Dynamic efficiency, however, concerns aligning the social costs and benefits of R&D and is therefore determined by how much of the social surplus from the new technology is appropriated as producer surplus. We analyze the relationship between cost-effectiveness measures and the degree of surplus appropriation by innovators driving dynamic efficiency. We illustrate how to estimate the two for the new HIV/AIDS therapies that entered the market after the late 1980's and find that only 5% of the social surplus is appropriated by innovators. We show how this finding can be generalized to other existing cost-effectiveness estimates by deriving how those estimates identify innovator appropriation for a set of studies of over 200 drugs. We find that these studies implicitly support a low degree of appropriation as well. Despite the high annual cost of drugs to patients, very low shares of social surplus may go to innovators, which may imply that cost-effectiveness is too high in a dynamic efficiency sense.",NA,"surplus appropriation from r&d and health care technology assessment procedures","jena, anupam b","10.3386/w12016","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w12016.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Tomas Philipson Irving B.

"JOUR","Mortality rates have fallen dramatically over time, starting in a few countries in the 18th century, and continuing to fall today. In just the past century, life expectancy has increased by over 30 years. At the same time, mortality rates remain much higher in poor countries, with a difference in life expectancy between rich and poor countries of also about 30 years. This difference persists despite the remarkable progress in health improvement in the last half century, at least until the HIV/AIDS pandemic. In both the time-series and the cross-section data, there is a strong correlation between income per capita and mortality rates, a correlation that also exists within countries, where richer, better-educated people live longer. We review the determinants of these patterns: over history, over countries, and across groups within countries. While there is no consensus about the causal mechanisms, we tentatively identify the application of scientific advance and technical progress (some of which is induced by income and facilitated by education) as the ultimate determinant of health. Such an explanation allows a consistent interpretation of the historical, cross-country, and within-country evidence.

"JOUR","Using longitudinal survey data collected in collaboration with a treatment program, this paper is the first to estimate the economic impacts of antiretroviral treatment in Africa. The responses in two important outcomes are studied: (1) labor supply of adult AIDS patients receiving treatment; and (2) labor supply of children and adults living in the patients' households. We find that within six months after the initiation of treatment, there is a 20 percent increase in the likelihood of the patient participating in the labor force and a 35 percent increase in weekly hours worked. Since patient health would continue to decline without treatment, these labor supply responses are underestimates of the impact of treatment on the treated. The upper bound of the treatment impact, which is based on plausible assumptions about the counterfactual, is considerably larger and also implies that the wage benefit from treatment is roughly equal to the costs of treatment provision. The responses in the labor supply of patients' household members are heterogeneous. Young boys and women work considerably less after initiation of treatment, while girls and men do not change their labor supply.

Are these negative outcomes due to pre-existing differences or do they represent the causal effect of marriage and schooling choices?  To better understand the true personal and societal consequences, this paper uses an instrumental variables approach which takes advantage of variation in state laws regulating the age at which individuals are allowed to marry, drop out of school, and begin work.  The baseline IV estimate indicates that a woman who marries young is 31 percentage points more likely to live in poverty when she is older.  Similarly, a woman who drops out of school is 11 percentage points more likely to be poor.  The results are robust to a variety of alternative specifications and estimation methods, including LIML estimation and a control function approach.

"JOUR","The viatical settlement industry provides an opportunity for terminally-ill consumers, typically HIV patients, to exploit a previously untapped source of equity in existing life insurance contracts to finance consumption and medical expenses. The 1996 introduction and dissemination of effecive anti-HIV medication reduced AIDS mortality, but also reduced viatical settlement prices, even holding fixed changes in life expectancy. Using Freedom of Information Act requests to state insurance regulatory agencies, we have assembled a unique dataset of over twelve thousand viatical transactions from firms licensed in states that regulate viatical settlement markets. We distinguish two explanations for falling prices---an increase in market power, and a change in market expectations about the likelihood of further improvements in HIV care. We find that both explanations have contributed to diminishing settlement prices over the last decade, but increased market power has been the more important driver in the most recent years.

"JOUR","This paper simulates the impact of the AIDS epidemic on future living standards in South Africa. I emphasize two competing effects. On the one hand, the epidemic is likely to have a detrimental impact on the human capital accumulation of orphaned children. On the other hand, widespread community infection lowers fertility, both directly, through a reduction in the willingness to engage in unprotected sexual activity, and indirectly, by increasing the scarcity of labour and the value of a woman's time. I find that even with the most pessimistic assumptions concerning reductions in educational attainment, the fertility effect dominates.

"JOUR","The purpose of this paper is to examine the role of alcohol policies in reducing the incidence of sexually transmitted diseases among youth. Previous research has shown that risky sexual practices (e.g., unprotected sex and multiple partners) that increase the risk of contracting a STD are highly correlated with alcohol use. If alcohol is a cause of risky sexual behavior, then policies that reduce the consumption of alcohol may also reduce the incidence of STDs. In this paper, we examine the relationship between alcohol policies (e.g., beer taxes and statutes pertaining to alcohol sales and drunk driving) and rates of gonorrhea and AIDS among teenagers and young adults. Results indicate that higher beer taxes are associated with lower rates of gonorrhea for males and are suggestive of lower AIDS rates. Strict drunk driving policies in the form of zero tolerance laws may also lower the gonorrhea rate among males under the legal drinking age.",NA,"an investigation of the effects of alcohol policies on youth stds","markowitz, sara","10.3386/w10949","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w10949.pdf",NA,"featured in NBER digest on 2011-11-18",NA,"Author contact info: Michael Grossman National Bureau of Economic Research 39 Broadway, Suite 1620  New York, NY 10006-3052 E-Mail: mgrossman@gc.cuny.edu  Robert Kaestner Harris School of Public Policy University of Chicago 1307 East 60th Street (Room 3057) Chicago, IL 60637 E-Mail: kaestner.robert@gmail.com  Sara Markowitz Department of Economics Emory University Rich Memorial Building 1602 Fishburne Dr. Atlanta, GA 30322 Tel: (404) 712-8167 E-Mail: sara.markowitz@emory.edu",2004,"http://www.nber.org/papers/w10949","No. 10949","Dec-04",NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE

"JOUR","Disease has traveled with goods and people since the earliest times. Armed globalization spread disease, to the extent of eliminating entire populations. The geography of disease shaped patterns of colonization and industrialization throughout the now poor world. Many see related threats to public health from current globalization. Multilateral and bilateral trade agreements do not always adequately represent the interests of poor countries, the General Agreement on Trade in Services may restrict the freedom of signatories to shape their own health delivery systems, and it remains unclear whether current arrangements for intellectual property rights are in the interests of citizens of poor countries with HIV/AIDS. However, to the extent that globalization promotes economic growth, population health may benefit, and there has been substantial reductions in poverty and in international inequalities in life-expectancy over the last 50 years. Although there is a strong inverse relationship between the poverty and life-expectancy in levels, gains in life expectancy have been only weakly correlated with growth rates and, in the last decade, the HIV/AIDS epidemic has widened international inequalities in life expectancy. The rapid transmission of health knowledge and therapies from one rich country to another has led to a swift convergence of adult mortality rates among the rich of the world, particularly men.

"JOUR","This paper studies the econometric problems associated with estimation of a stochastic process  that is endogenously sampled. Our interest is to infer the law of motion of a discrete-time stochastic process {pt} that is observed only at a subset of times {t1,..., tn} that depend on the outcome of a probabilistic sampling rule that depends on the history of the process as well as other observed covariates xt . We focus on a particular example where pt denotes the daily wholesale price of a standardized steel product. However there are no formal exchanges or centralized markets where steel is traded and pt can be observed. Instead nearly all steel transaction prices are a result of private bilateral negotiations between buyers and sellers, typically intermediated by middlemen known as steel service centers. Even though there is no central record of daily transactions prices in the steel market, we do observe transaction prices for a particular firm -- a steel service center that purchases large quantities of steel in the wholesale market for subsequent resale in the retail market. The endogenous sampling problem arises from the fact that the firm only records pt on the days that it purchases steel. We present a parametric analysis of this problem under the assumption that the timing of steel purchases is part of an optimal trading strategy that maximizes the firm's expected discounted trading profits. We derive a parametric partial information maximum likelihood (PIML) estimator that solves the endogenous sampling problem and efficiently estimates the unknown parameters of a Markov transition probability that determines the law of motion for the underlying {pt} process. The PIML estimator also yields estimates of the structural parameters that determine the optimal trading rule. We also introduce an alternative consistent, less efficient, but computationally simpler simulated minimum distance (SMD) estimator that avoids high dimensional numerical integrations required by the PIML estimator. Using the SMD estimator, we provide estimates of a truncated lognormal AR(1) model of the wholesale price processes for particular types of steel plate. We use this to infer the share of the middleman's discounted profits that are due to markups paid by its retail customers, and the share due to price speculation. The latter measures the firm's success in forecasting steel prices and in timing its purchases in order to  buy low and sell high'. The more successful the firm is in speculation (i.e. in strategically timing its purchases), the more serious are the potential biases that would result from failing to account for the endogeneity of the sampling process.",NA,"econometric methods for endogenously sampled time series: the case of commodity price speculation in the steel market","rust, john","10.3386/t0278","National Bureau of Economic Research Technical Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/t0278.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: George J.

I find that the tight labor market reduced poverty substantively, gainsaying the gloom that developed in the 1980s about the effect of economic growth on the less advantaged; and that socially undesirable behaviour also fell in the period, potentially due in part to the boom.. While the rising tide of economic progress can lift many boats, however, around 6-8% of Americans cannot be so helped, and thus constitute a relatively long term poverty population.

"JOUR","As part of recent reforms of the welfare programs in the U.S., many states and localities have refocused their Welfare-to-Work programs from an emphasis on human capital acquisition (i.e., providing basic education and vocational training) to an emphasis on ""work-first,"" (i.e., moving welfare recipients into unsubsidized employment as quickly as possible).  This change in emphasis has been motivated, in part, by results from the experimental evaluation, conducted by the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation (MDRC), of California's Greater Avenues to Independence (GAIN) programs during the early 1990s. Their evaluation found that, compared to programs in other countries that emphasized skill accumulation, the work-first program in Riverside County had larger effects on employment, earnings, and welfare receipt.  In addition, the Riverside program was cheaper per recipient than the other programs. The paper reexamines the GAIN programs from two complementary perspectives.  First, we extend the earlier analysis through nine years post-randomization, which is the longest follow-up of any randomized training program, and find that the stronger impacts of Riverside County's work first program tend to shrink, whereas the weaker impacts for the human capital programs in Alameda and Los Angeles Counties tend to remain constant or even grow over time. Second, we develop and implement methods to allow the comparison of programs implemented by random assignment in different places despite striking differences in the composition of the participant populations.  On a substantive level, our reexamination of the GAIN experiment lead us to conclude that although the work first programs were more successful than the human capital accumulation programs in the early years, this relative advantage disappears in later years. On a methodological level, our results suggest that--at least in this welfare context--these methods are a promising approach both for the estimation of program effects from non-experimental data and for extrapolating program results from one location to a different location with a different population mix.",NA,"the long-term gains from gain: a re-analysis of the impacts of the california gain program","klerman, jacob a","10.3386/w8007","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w8007.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: V.

"JOUR","In this paper we rethink the NAIRU concept and examine whether it might have a useful role in monetary policy.  We argue that it can, but success depends critically on defining NAIRU as a short-run concept and distinguishing it from a long-run concept like the natural rate of unemployment.  We examine what effect uncertainty has on the use of NAIRU in policy.  Uncertainty about the level of NAIRU does not imply that monetary policy should react less to the NAIRU gap.  However, uncertainty about the effect of the NAIRU gap on inflation does require adjustments to the policy reaction function.  Also, as in Brainard (1967), uncertainty about the effect of the monetary policy instrument on the NAIRU gap reduces the magnitude of the policy response.  We estimate a simple NAIRU gap model for the United States to obtain quantitative measures of uncertainty and to assess how these measures affect our view of the policy reaction function.",NA,"rethinking the role of nairu in monetary policy: implications of model formulation and uncertainty","mishkin, frederic s","10.3386/w6518","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w6518.pdf","published as Arturo Estrella, Frederic S.

"JOUR","This paper uses data from the Greater Avenues for Independence (GAIN) initiative to discuss the evaluation of programs that are implemented at multiple sites. Two frequently used methods are to pool the data or to use fixed effects (an extreme version of which estimates separate models for each site). The former approach, however, ignores site effects. Though the latter estimates site effects, it lacks a framework for predicting the impact in subsequent implementations of the program (e.g., will a new implementation resemble Riverside or Alameda?). I develop a model for earnings that lies between these two extremes. For the GAIN data, I show that most of the differences across sites are due to differences in the composition of participants. I show also that uncertainty regarding predicting site effects is important; when the predictive uncertainty is ignored, the treatment impact for the Riverside sites is significant, but when we consider predictive uncertainty, the impact for the Riverside sites is insignificant. Finally, I demonstrate that the model is able to extrapolate site effects with reasonable accuracy, when the site for which the prediction is being made does not differ substantially from the sites already observed. For example, the San Diego treatment effects could have been predicted based on observable site characteristics, but the Riverside effects are consistently underestimated.",NA,"was there a riverside miracle? a framework for evaluating multi-site programs","dehejia, rajeev","10.3386/w7844","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w7844.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Rajeev H.

Results from a survey of Israeli school-teachers show that the influx of new computers increased teachers' use of computer-aided instruction (CAI) in the 4th grade, with a smaller effect on CAI in 8th grade.  CAI does not appear to have had educational benefits that translated into higher test scores.  Results for 4th graders show sharply lower Math scores in the group that was awarded computers, with smaller (insignificant) negative effects on verbal scores. Results for 8th graders' test scores are very imprecise, probably reflecting the much weaker first-stage relationship between program funding and the use of CAI in 8th grade.  The estimates for 8th grade Math scores are also negative, however.",NA,"new evidence on classroom computers and pupil learning","lavy, victor","10.3386/w7424","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w7424.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Joshua Angrist Department of Economics, E52-436 MIT 77 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02139 Tel: 617/253-8909 Fax: 617/253-1330 E-Mail: angrist@mit.edu  Victor Lavy Department of Economics University of Warwick Coventry, CV4 7AL United Kingdom Tel: 44(0) 24 7657 4158 E-Mail: v.lavy@warwick.ac.uk",1999,"http://www.nber.org/papers/w7424","No. 7424","Nov-99",NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE
"JOUR","I argue for thinking of program evaluation as a decision problem.

I also argue for incorporating the post-evaluation assignment mechanism for the program under consideration into the evaluation process. I show that if policies, such as allowing a career counselor to choose which program individuals join, are included in the evaluation, then GAIN is superior to AFDC whereas the opposite ranking emerges from the standard treatment versus control comparison which ignores potential heterogeneity in the treatment impact.",NA,"program evaluation as a decision problem","dehejia, rajeev","10.3386/w6954","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w6954.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Rajeev H.

"JOUR","This paper studies the effect of employee job selection in a model of statistical discrimination in a competitive labor market. In an economy in which there are quality differences between groups, a surprisingly strong condition is required to guarantee discrimination against the worse qualified group --- MLRP must hold. In addition, because of the self-selection bias induced by competition,  the resulting discrimination is small when compared to the magnitude of the underlying quality differences between groups. In cases in which the discrimination results because employers' ability to measure qualifications differs from one group to another, the conditions under which one group is discriminated against are much weaker.  In general, the group employers know  least about is always favored.  The economic impact of discrimination that is derived from quality differences between groups is shown to be quite different to the economic impact of discrimination that derives from differences in employer familiarity between groups. In the latter case, for a set of equally qualified employees, it is possible for  members of the group that is discriminated against to have higher wages. Finally, we show how the results can be used to explain a number of empirical puzzles that are documented in the literature.",NA,"statistical discrimination in a competitive labor market","berk, jonathan b","10.3386/w6871","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w6871.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Jonathan B.

"JOUR","Recent research has suggested that one of the important consequences of teen drinking is reduced scholastic achievement and that state excise taxes on beer and minimum legal drinking ages (MLDA) as policy instruments can have a positive impact on educational attainment. But there is reason to ask whether the results are empirically sound.  Prior research as assumed the decision to drink is made independently of schooling decisions and estimations that have recognized potential simultaneity in these decisions may be poorly identified since they rely only on the cross-state variation in beer taxes and MLDA as exogenous determinants of teen drinking. A more convincing strategy would rely on the within-state variation in alcohol availability over time.  We use the increases in the state MLDA during the late 70's and 80's as an exogenous source of variation in teen drinking. Using data from the 1977-92 Monitoring the Future (MTF) surveys, we show that teens with an MLDA of 18 were more likely to drink than teens with a higher drinking age. If teen drinking did reduce educational attainment then it should have risen within a state after the MLDA was increased. Using data from over 1.3 million respondents from the 1960-1969 birth cohorts in the 1990 Public-Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) we find that changes in the MLDA had small effects on educational attainment measured by high school completion, college entrance and completion.  A new method developed by Angrist and Krueger (1992, 1995) lets us tie these results together. Using matched cohorts from the MTF and PUMS data sets, we report two-sample instrumental variables (TSIV) estimates of the effect of teen drinking on educational attainment. These estimates are smaller than corresponding single-equation probit estimates, indicating that teen drinking does not have an independent effect on educational attainment.",NA,"teen drinking and education attainment: evidence from two-sample instrumental variables (tsiv) estimates","evans, william n","10.3386/w6082","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w6082.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Thomas Dee Stanford University 520 Galvez Mall, CERAS Building, 5th Floor Stanford, CA 94305-3084 Tel: (650) 736-1258 Fax: (650) 723-9931 E-Mail: tdee@stanford.edu  William N.

"JOUR","This paper estimates the NAIRU (standing for the Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment) as a parameter that varies over time.  The NAIRU is the unemployment rate that is consistent with a constant rate of inflation.  Its value is determined in an econometric model in which the inflation rate depends on its own past values ( inertia ), demand shocks proxied by the difference between the actual unemployment rate and the estimated NAIRU, and a set of supply shock variables.  The estimated NAIRU for the U.S. economy differs somewhat for alternative measures of the inflation rate.  The NAIRU estimated for the GDP deflator varies over the past forty years within the narrow range of 5.7 to 6.4 percent; its estimated value for the most recent quarter (1996:Q1) is 5.7 percent. In that quarter a lower NAIRU of 5.3 percent is obtained for the chain-weighted PCE deflator.  Recent research claiming that there is a three-percentage-point range of uncertainty about the NAIRU is rejected as inconsistent with the behavior of the American economy in the late 1980s and early 1990s.",NA,"the time-varying nairu and its implications for economic policy","gordon, robert j","10.3386/w5735","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w5735.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Robert J.

Imperfections in the labor market have little direct relation to changes in the NAIRU, but long-term unemployment benefits magnify the effects of disinflation.

Our analysis uses well- established empirical growth models to control for a variety of factors possibly correlated with AIDS prevalence that might also influence growth.  We also account for possible simultaneity in the relationship between AIDS and economic growth. Our main finding is that the AIDS epidemic has had an insignificant effect on the growth rate of per capita income, with no evidence of reverse causality.

"JOUR","Two-stage-least-squares (2SLS) estimates are biased towards OLS estimates.  This bias grows with the degree of over-identification and can generate highly misleading results.  In this paper we propose two simple alternatives to 2SLS and limited-information-maximum-likelihood (LIML) estimators for models with more instruments than endogenous regressors.  These estimators can be interpreted as instrumental variables procedures using an instrument that is independent of disturbances even in finite samples.  Independence is achieved by using a `leave-one-out' jackknife-type fitted value in place of the usual first-stage equation.  The new estimators are first-order equivalent to 2SLS but with finite-sample properties superior to those of 2SLS and similar to LIML when there are many instruments.

Asymptotic representations are provided for various instrumental variable statistics, including the two-stage least squares (TSLS) and limited information maximum- likelihood (LIML) estimators and their t-statistics.  The asymptotic distributions are found to provide good approximations to sampling distributions with just 20 observations per instrument.

"JOUR","The evolution of unemployment in West Germany and the U. S. stands in sharp contrast, with German unemployment much lower from 1960 to the early 19705 but substantially higher from 1984 to 1988. This paper provides a framework for examining the relationship between inflation and unemployment that sheds light on these developments. The theoretical section develops a new nonstructural model of wage and Price adjustment that integrates severa! concepts that have often been treated separately, including Phillips curve ""level effects,"" hysteresis ""change effects,"" the error-correction mechanism, and the role of changes in labor's share that act as a supply shock. The empirical analysis reaches rwo striking conclusions. First, during 1973-90coefficients in our German wage equations arc remarkably similar to those in the U.S., with almost identical estimates of the Phillips curve slope, of the hysteresis effect, and of the NAIRU. The two countries also share similar inflation behavior, in that inflation depends more closely on the capacity utilization rate than on the unemployment rate, The big difference berween the two countries is that there is no feedback from wages to prices in Germany, and so high unemployment does not put downward pressure on the inflation rate. During the 19705 and 19805 in Germany there emerged a growing mismatch between the labor market and industrial capacity, so that the unemployment rate consistent with the mean (constant-inflation) utilization rate (""MURU"") increased sharply, while in the U. S. the MURU was relatively stable. The German utilization rate in late 1990was about 90 percent, considerably higher than the estimated MURU of 85 percent. Accordingly, we conclude that the Bundesbank was appropriately concerned about the acceleration of inflation implied by the tight product market of that period.",NA,"german and american wage and price dynamics:  differences and common thenes","gordon, robert j","10.3386/w4292","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w4292.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Wolfgang Franz  Robert J.

"JOUR","This paper reviews the two leading methods used to project the number of AIDS cases: back calculation and extrapolation. These methods are assessed in light of key features of the HIV/AIDS epidemic and of data on the epidemic; they are also assessed in terms of the quality of the projections they yield. Our analysis shows that both methods have tended to overproject, often by sizable amounts, the number of AIDS cases in the U.S., especially among homosexual/bisexual males and users of blood and blood products. Our results provide no evidence that the use of AZT and other prophylaxis accounts for these projection errors. Rather, the overprojections appear to be mainly the result of a considerable reduction in the rate of new HIV infection among the gay community starting in 1983-85. A new method for projecting AIDS cases is proposed that exploits knowledge about the process generating AIDS cases and that incorporates readily available information about rates of new HIV infection. This method is far less sensitive to estimates of the incubation distribution than the method of back calculation and is shown, for the two transmission categories studied, to generate far more accurate AIDS case projections through 1990 than those based on the method of extrapolation. Relative to the method of extrapolation, this method projects 22,000 fewer new AIDS cases for 1995 (a 36 percent difference).

We measure the time-series property of medical costs using information on medical deductions from a panel of tax returns. During the period of analysis, 1968-73, taxpayers could deduct medical expenses above 3 percent of income. We correct for the resulting censoring bias using multivariate Tobit estimated with a variant of the smoothed simulated maximum likelihood (SSML) method. The data suggest that the burden of out-of-pocket medical expenses is substantially larger for lower income families. Furthermore, the estimated coefficients suggest substantial time-persistence in out-of-pocket medical care costs; a $1 increase in out-of-pocket medical spending is predicted to increase future spending by an additional $2.80.

"JOUR","As of March 31, 1987, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control had reported 33,350 cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Yet by that date, physicians had actually diagnosed 42,670 cases. The difference arises from significant delays in the reporting of AIDS cases to public health authorities. An estimated 70% of cases are reported two or more months after diagnosis; about 23% are reported seven or more months later; and about 5% take more than three years to come in. Moreover, the probability distribution of delays has been shifting to the right, with the median delay increasing by 0.6 months since mid-1986. From the data on reported cases and the estimated probability distribution of reporting delays, I reconstruct the actual incidence of AIDS from January 1982 through March 1987. The doubling time of the epidemic fell from about 6 months in 1982 to 15-16 months in 1986.",NA,"delay in reporting acquired immune deficiency syndrome (aids)","harris, jeffrey e","10.3386/w2278","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w2278.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Jeffrey E.

"JOUR","Econometric evidence suggests that the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (the NAIRU) has risen sharply in Europe in the past fifteen years. In the first section of this paper, I review the recent proliferation of supply-side models that say interesting things about why the NAIRU hasincreased so substantially in Europe. In the second section of the paper, I employ a simple example to show how aggregate demand should optimally be managed in response to transitory and permanent supply shocks, especially those shocks that cause a persistent rise in the NAIRU. Also, I discuss some policy implications of the increasingly popular ""hysteresis hypothesis, that the NAIRU itself is influenced by the time path of actual unemployment.",NA,"high unemployment in europe:  diagnosis and policy implications","sachs, jeffrey","10.3386/w1830","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w1830.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Jeffrey D.

"JOUR","This paper tests hypotheses regarding the parameters in investors'asset demand functions. Most important is the hypothesis that federal bonds are closer substitutes for equity than for money; it is associated with the hypothesis of ""portfolio crowding out"" by federal borrowing. Previous regression studies of asset demand functions have not been able to obtain precise and plausible estimates for the parameters, without the imposition of prior beliefs. The present paper uses a MLE technique that dominates regression in that it makes full use of the constraint that the parameters are not determined arbitrarily, but rather are determined by mean-variance optimization on the part of the investor. The technique also dominates, on the other hand, previous estimates of the optimal portfolio from ex post return data, in that expected returns are not assumed to be constant over time, or to change slowly, but rather are allowed to fluctuate freely. Thus the framework is consistent with questions such as the effects of a sudden increase in federal debt on the expected returns of the various assets.Some hypotheses are tested where the answer seems clear in advance, such as a negative effect of the supply of money on the expected rate of return on equities. There the results of the MLE technique are much more plausible than the regression results. In the case of greatest controversy, a point estimate shows portfolio crowding in, not portfolio crowding out.",NA,"a test of portfolio crowding-out and related issues in finance","frankel, jeffrey a","10.3386/w1205","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w1205.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Jeffrey A.

"JOUR","This working paper provides some preliminary results on the computational feasibility of nonlinear full information maximum likelihood (NECML) estimation. Severa1 of the test cases presented were also subjected to nonlinear three stage least square (NLBSLS) estimation in order to illustrate the relative performance of the two estimation techniques. In addition, certain other aspects central to practical implementation are highlighted. These include the effect of various computers on the efficiency of the code, as well as the relative merits of numerical and analytical generation of gradient information. Broadly speaking, NLFIML appears competitive in cost and superior in statistical properties to NL3SLS.",NA,"estimation of econometric model using nonlinear full information maximum likelihood: preliminary computer results","wall, kent d","10.3386/w0142","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w0142.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: David A.

"JOUR","The Rational Distributed Lag Structural Form (RSF) representation of an econometric model is introduced and its relationship to several standard forms of representation is discussed.  The FIML estimation problem for the RSF is then considered and formulated as a nonlinear, unconstrained  optimization problem.  A solution to the relation optimization problem is then obtained by an application of the Davidon-Fletcher-Powell variable metric method using simple first difference approximations for the necessary gradients.  This approach requires a minimum of effort on the part of the model builder since there is no longer  any need to analytically determine, and then program, the gradient expressions.  The feasibility of the method is demonstrated with several examples.",NA,"fiml estimation of rational distributed lag structural form models","wall, kent d","10.3386/w0077","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w0077.pdf","published as Kent D.

"JOUR","The prediction accuracy of six estimators of econometric models are compared.  Two of rthe estimators are ordinary least squares (OLS) and full-information maximum likelihood.  (FML).  The other four estimators are robust estimators in the sense that they give less weight to large residuals.  One of the four estimators is approximately equivalent to the least-absolute-residual (LAR) estimator, one is a combination of OLS for small residuals and LAR for large residuals, one is an estimator proposed by John W. Tukey, and one is a combination of FIML and LAR.  All of the estimators account for the first-order serial correlation of the error terms.  The main conclusion is that robust estimators appear quite promising for the estimation of econometric models.  Of the robust estimators considered in the paper, the one based on minimizing the sum of the absolute values of the residuals performed the best.  The FIML estimator and the combination of the FIML and LAR estimators also appear promising.",NA,"a comparison of fiml and robust estimates of a nonlinear macroeconomic model","fair, ray c","10.3386/w0015","National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","http://www.nber.org/papers/w0015.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Author contact info: Ray C.
