"Agri-food global value chains (GVCs) are failing to provide healthy and affordable diets within planetary boundaries. Many cutting-edge technologies are being developed to address the sustainability challenges throughout agri-food GVCs. While several studies seek to analyze the impacts of specific innovations on socioeconomic and environmental dimensions, the relationship between industry structure and the process of technological change has not received much attention in the value chain literature. Here, we focus on the entrepreneurial landscape of innovation in agri-food GVCs to 1) identify which technologies have been receiving most support from investors and 2) analyze the corporate strategies of the largest agri-food multinational companies regarding their investments in new technologies. Using Crunchbase as our primary data source and machine learning for natural language processing, we have identified around 15,500 companies developing innovations linked to agri-food GVCs, from farming to last-mile delivery. However, our analyses show an imbalanced scene in which downstream technologies capture most investors’ interest. Then, we use these results to explore the direction of investments by dominant agri-food firms, where we identify three trends: upgrading strategies to improve their core activities, defensive strategies to control technologies competing with their core business, and corporate portfolio strategies to seize profit opportunities. © 2024 The Author(s)",14,10.1016/j.foodpol.2024.102684,"This paper investigates the entrepreneurial landscape of innovation in agri-food global value chains (GVCs) by analyzing investment trends in technologies and corporate strategies of major agri-food firms.

"The article aims to evaluate – from the point of view of selected socio-economic aspects – the implementation of an innovative weed control technology into agricultural practice using laser energy targeted at reducing pesticide use. The achievement of the stated objective required an analysis of the research output concerning the problem of pesticide sustaina-bility in European Union agriculture and an analysis of EU policies in this field. The paper also utilises data obtained through research by conducting in-depth interviews with representatives of three stakeholder groups: farmers, society and business. The subject of the interviews was to assess the impact of large-scale dissemination of an innovative weed control technology on selected socio-economic aspects. The article is one of the first studies to assess the social impact of innovative technologies using artificial intelligence and laser technology for weed control in agriculture. The implementation of this technology can have a significant impact on running farms in a more sustainable way, but a prerequisite for its successful use is the inclusion of social and economic considerations. © 2024, Wydawnictwo Ekonomia i Srodowisko.

"In the era of digitalisation, most countries worldwide are well aware of the need to develop smart-green agriculture because the negative impacts of climate change are becoming increasingly apparent on a large-scale. The application of AI in agriculture supports automation and optimisation of production processes, helping farmers increase productivity and reduce production costs. AI also allows farmers to predict and avoid climate and disease risks. Therefore, this study investigates the role of perceived usefulness on farmers’ acceptance of AI systems through the interaction with personal attitude, personal innovativeness, green and lean practices, government support, and performance expectancy. This study conducted multiple analyses to test these proposed relationships. The results found that the interactions between perceived usefulness with personal attitude, personal innovativeness, government support, and performance expectancy enhance the farmers’ acceptance of AI systems.

"The research relevance is determined by the need to create a strategy for the development of innovative entrepreneurial structures in livestock farming, the application of which can significantly increase the economic return on farms. The study aims to develop a strategy for the development of progressive livestock farms. The following general scientific methods were used for the study: analysis, synthesis, deduction, induction, and generalisation. Among the innovations considered were various genetic studies to improve the animal genome (the amount of meat and milk, the efficiency of feed assimilation), as well as the selection of genetically healthy embryos for breeding; the use of modern technologies in livestock farming, such as Radio Frequency Identification, Augmented Reality, Convolutional Neural Networks and Global Positioning System; technologies aimed at automating animal feeding processes. Particular attention was paid to various livestock monitoring systems created using advanced algorithms. A strategy for the development of innovative livestock farms was also presented, with drones, CCTV cameras, mixed reality glasses and scanner gloves as the main elements. Other necessary elements included a drone control module and software. Relevant calculations to prove the feasibility of implementing this strategy and its financial potential were also carried out. Provided that 82 units of various equipment are used, with a total cost of $187,970, the strategy provides for a profit of $1,072,030, with a 3-year implementation period and a payback period of less than 6 months. The practical significance of the information obtained is that it can be considered by researchers to further study the specifics of implementing innovative projects in livestock production, as well as to further develop various strategies for agricultural modernisation in Kazakhstan.

"This study investigates the application of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) in forecasting agricultural yields in Kazakhstan, highlighting its implications for economic management and policy-making. Utilizing data from the Bureau of National Statistics of the Republic of Kazakhstan (2000-2023), the research develops two ANN models using the Neural Net Fitting library in MATLAB. The first model predicts the total gross yield of main agricultural crops, while the second forecasts the share of individual crops, including cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, vegetables, melons, and sugar beets. The models demonstrate high accuracy, with the total gross yield model achieving an R-squared value of 0.98 and the individual crop model showing an R value of 0.99375. These results indicate a strong predictive capability, essential for practical agricultural and economic planning. The study extends previous research by incorporating a comprehensive range of climatic and agrochemical data, enhancing the precision of yield predictions. The findings have significant implications for Kazakhstan's economy. Accurate yield predictions can optimize agricultural planning, contribute to food security, and inform policy decisions.

"This paper analyzes the nonlinear effects in price transmission from international markets to the local rice market of Dakar (Senegal) focusing on asymmetries through threshold effects. We use recent machine learning methods (model-based recursive partitioning trees) to detect asymmetries in the price transmission mechanism. Using a model based recursive partitioning algorithm, we identify a threshold and confirm the asymmetry in the price transmission. Local retail prices are more sensitive to world price increases than to declines. Only 11.80% of positive deviations (international prices go down) are eliminated at the end of the subsequent month, while 39.50% of negative deviations (world prices go up) are eliminated after one month. These results highlight the role of transaction costs and the market power of commercial intermediaries in price transmission in the sense that margins are corrected more rapidly when they are squeezed relative to their long run level than when they are stretched.

"Much of the developed world has adopted substantial, complex agricultural subsidy schemes in an attempt to produce desired rural livelihood and environmental outcomes. Understanding how farmers adjust their production activity in response to farm subsidies is crucial for setting optimal agricultural policy. Whereas standard economic theory suggests that farmers largely adjust production levels in response to prices and marginal subsidy rates, recent work in consumer behavior suggests that average (dis-)incentives may play a relevant role. We use a unique panel covering all farms applying for subsidies in Norway and a flexible deep-learning method to exploit kinks in the subsidy scheme to answer whether farmers respond more to average or marginal subsidies. In contrast to the standard economic theory of production, we find suggestive empirical evidence that farmers respond more to changes in average payments than to changes in marginal payments. We anticipate that our findings on the relevance of average payment levels for farmers' decision making may inspire further theoretical and empirical inquiries into agricultural policy effects. The study also highlights how novel deep-learning tools can be applied for detailed policy analysis and what advantages and challenges come with it. We believe that this approach has substantial potential for analysts and policymakers to evaluate and predict the impacts of policy options. © 2023 The Authors.

"In modern times, the risk of food insecurity is a concern for policymakers at the global and national levels, as the issue of hunger and malnutrition still exists. Food security is vulnerable to any crises. The main goal of this paper is to create a neural-network-based predictive model to forecast food consumption trends in Kazakhstan, aiming to reduce the risk of food insecurity. The initial phase of this study involved identifying socioeconomic factors that significantly influence food consumption behaviors in Kazakhstan. Principal component analysis was used to identify key variables, which became the basis for modelling artificial neural networks. It was revealed that the poverty rate, GDP per capita, and food price index are pivotal determinants of food consumption in Kazakhstan. Two models were prepared: to predict food consumption on a national scale per capita per month, and to predict the percentage distribution of various food categories. The prediction of the percentage distribution of various food categories in Kazakhstan demonstrates the positive modelling quality indicators and strengthens the assumption that network modelling can be used. Predictions for total food consumption over the next three years indicate declining metrics, raising concerns about the potential food insecurity risk in Kazakhstan. © 2023 by the authors.",14,10.3390/economies12010011,"This paper develops a neural network-based predictive model to forecast food consumption trends in Kazakhstan, focusing on socioeconomic factors influencing food consumption and the implications for food security.

"Climate change continues to fuel concern about the future cost of publicly subsidized crop insurance programs in developed nations. These changes in climate are expected to alter the upper and lower tails of crop yield distributions differently. This may best be captured by modeling the climate–yield relationship heterogeneously across different parts of the yield distribution. To this end, we consider a mixture model with the parameters expressed as nonparametric functions (to capture any nonlinearities) of weather variables estimated by machine learning methods (neural net). By doing so, we are able to identify possibly heterogeneous effects of climate change on each component, the mixing probabilities, and thus all moments of the yield distribution. We find changing climate alters, quite significantly, the entire shape of the yield distribution. The overall probability of the lower tail tends to increase as temperatures rise, to the point where some yield distributions become positively skewed. Across a range of climate change scenarios, premium rates for fixed guarantees are expected to rise 20–66% relative to no climate change by 2040. However, if we allow the yield guarantees to also fall because of additional losses from climate change, premium rates (albeit not comparable given yield guarantees are different) increase notably less (6–14%), suggesting less solvency issues than first thought. © 2024 The Authors.

"Effective agricultural insurance and risk management programs rely on accurate crop yield forecasting. In this article, a novel deep factor model for crop yield forecasting and crop insurance ratemaking is proposed. This framework first utilizes a deep autoencoder to extract a latent factor, called the production index, that integrates salient spatial temporal patterns in the original yield data. Then, a concatenated deep learning model is constructed to enhance the modeling of the production index and the reconstruction of crop yields. Convolutional neural networks are employed to capture the high-dimensional and highly nonlinear structure within the crop yield data, as well as its interactions with weather and economic variables. The proposed deep factor framework is applied to the county-level data in the state of Iowa. Empirical results show that the newly proposed deep factor model significantly improves the prediction accuracy, especially in the test set.

"In the growing economy, the transport sector emerges as the primary generator of the most prevalent greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) due to the combustion of fossil fuels. The medical sector is witnessing a significant expansion of artificial intelligence (AI) to uncover health insights and in transportation sectors to avoid traffic congestion. In general, truck transportations cause delay in deliveries and it emits more carbon. In the context of rural healthcare, the improper delivery of medicinal drugs and surgical equipment has resulted in disruptions for patients. To precise these issues and to promote sustainability, this study aimed to design a circular inventory system to control the waste through circular economy practices, reduce emissions by investing in AI technology, green technology, source reduction technology. Thus, this study uses AI-Drone transportation as an alternative to traditional truck-based delivery system for fast delivery and to reduce carbon foot prints. Green technology reduces anthropogenic GHG emissions by controlling the carbon under the carbon tax and carbon allowance system. This study employs reverse logistics to collect and remanufacture the waste and damaged items. Rather than landfilling, recycling of medical waste reduces emission and waste while conserving resources.

"The world population is facing unprecedented increase and with that arises the need for additional agricultural resources. This increase has put a tremendous amount of pressure on modern society to develop ingenious sustainable food production systems. Aquaponics, an emerging alternative to traditional farming practice, promises to offer a sustainable and efficient solution to this problem, though its economic viability is still being tested. The recent shift towards Industry 4.0 technologies, such as the internet of things, big data, artificial intelligence, or cloud computing, has opened new avenues for this farming method to enhance productivity, energy efficiency, and yields while enabling smart management decision-making. However, the implementation of a large-scale aquaponics system faces multiple challenges, both from the technical and economic aspects, one of which is related to excessive energy consumption. Almost three-quarters of this energy is consumed by illumination; as such, the detailed focus of this paper has been placed on the growth lights - types, specific wavelengths, photoperiod, daily light integral, and switching frequency. This paper follows a systematic approach to review the current literature on energy efficiency in aquaponics and address research questions about these topics. It is concluded that light emitting diodes with light treatment tailored for specific plant species and growth phase may offer about 75% energy savings when compared to the traditional lighting. Furthermore, smart monitoring applications that enhance energy-use efficiency and use various emerging technologies such as big data and the internet of things have been discussed.

"We use a 4-year panel (2019–2022) of 10,125 village councils in Ukraine to estimate effects of the war started by Russia on area and expected yield of winter crops aggregated up from the field level. Satellite imagery is used to provide information on direct damage to agricultural fields; classify crop cover using machine learning; and compute the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for winter cereal fields as a proxy for yield. Without conflict, winter crop area would have been 9.35 rather than 8.38 million ha, a 0.97 million ha reduction, only 14% of which can be attributed to direct conflict effects.

"Agriculture is the primary source of food, fuel, and raw materials and is vital to any country’s economy. Farmers, the backbone of agriculture, primarily rely on instinct to determine what crops to plant in any given season. They are comfortable following customary farming practices and standards and are oblivious to the fact that crop yield is highly dependent on current environmental and soil conditions. Crop recommendations involve multifaceted factors such as weather, soil quality, crop production, market demand, and prices, making it crucial for farmers to make well-informed decisions. An improper or imprudent crop recommendation can affect them, their families, and the entire agricultural sector. Modern technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science have emerged as efficient solutions to combat issues like declining crop production and lower profits. This research proposes a Smart Crop Recommendation framework that leverages machine learning to empower farmers to make informed decisions about optimal crop selection. The framework consists of two phases: crop filtration and yield prediction. Crops are filtered in the first phase using an artificial neural network based on local input parameters. The second phase estimates yield for filtered crops, considering the season, farm area, and location data. The final recommendation provides farmers with crops aimed at maximizing profit. The remarkable 99.10% accuracy of the framework is demonstrated through experimentation using artificial neural networks and the 0.99 R2 error metric for the random forest. The uniqueness of this framework lies in its distinctive focus on the farm level and its consideration of the challenges and various agricultural features that change over time.

"Purpose: The objective of this study is to build a crop insurance premium recommender model which will be fair to both crop insurance policy holders and crop insurance service providers. Theoretical Framework: The Nonparametric Bayesian Model (modified) is the name of the proposed model suggested by Maulidi et al. (2021) and it consists of six variables which are regional risk, cultivation time period, land area, claim frequency, discount eligibility (local variable) and premium. Discount eligibility variable is introduced to encourage right farming practices among farmers. Design/methodology/approach: Descriptive research method is used in this study as it is used to accurately represent the characteristics of a group of items. The population for this study is 943 respondents. The entire dataset is used for in-depth and accurate analysis. Five Artificial Intelligence models (Machine Learning models) are proposed for crop insurance premium prediction and they are Ada Boost Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor, Extra Trees Regressor, Support Vector Regressor and K-Neighbors Regressor. Among them Gradient Boosting Regression model has given the highest accuracy. Thus, Gradient Boosting Regression model is the most suitable model to be recommended for crop insurance premium prediction. Findings and Suggestions: Regional risk, land area, claim frequency and cultivation time period is the order of independent variables from highest to least in terms of regression coefficient. This relative importance helps Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) to suggest farmers that they should concentrate most on the regional risk or chances of crop failure in a particular region in which they are doing agriculture and least on the cultivation time period of a crop or the season in which a crop is cultivated. Two suggestions for future researchers are to extend this research work to other parts of Tamil Nadu and to apply hybrid machine learning techniques to the proposed model. Practical Implication: Unlike the existing formula-based traditional method used for calculating crop insurance premium, artificial intelligence models (machine learning models) can automatically learn the changes that take place with respect to the nature of variables in the proposed model and improve its accuracy based on new data. Hence, the crop insurance premium suggested by the most accurate model among the artificial intelligence models used in this study will be fair to both NBFCs and farmers. Here, fair means moderate. On the other hand, the crop insurance premium suggested by the existing formula-based method may not be fair in the long term as they cannot automatically learn the changes that take place with respect to the nature of variables in the proposed model and improve.

"Many areas of contemporary life need the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and the Internet of Things (IoT) for analysis and comprehension. The application of AI and ML in livestock farming has led to an improved understanding of animal behavior and discomfort, the prevention and management of diseases, and the efficiency of the farmer's economic choices. Digital twin technology is a particularly promising field that builds on AI and is already being utilized to increase efficiency and decrease costs in cattle livestock agriculture. A Digital Twin (DT) is a constant-update numerical copy of smart livestock environments. The proposed research is IoT, and Digital Twins in Livestock Farming (DTLF) might expand extensive Precision Livestock Farming (PLF), technology and tools use, and farm animal health and well-being.

"The majority of the food grain supply chain (FGSC) is run in a linear fashion, requiring substantial inputs that produce mostly inedible by-products, environmental damage and wastage. Moreover, population increase, declining food resources, shifting weather patterns, and dwindling supplies pose serious problems to the FGSC. Effective usage and consumption of resources to harmonize ecological, economic, and social elements is the need of the hour from the Agri 5.0 and circular economy (CE) perspective. Fortunately, modern technological developments like artificial intelligence (AI) might represent a paradigm change in this context. However, enablers for AI adoption haven't been studied sufficiently despite AI's popularity. Hence, the fundamental objective of this research is to identify and examine key enablers that facilitate rapid AI adoption in FGSC, empowering Agri 5.0 and CE in India.

"Agriculture is one of the most significant global economic activities responsible for feeding the world population of 7.75 billion. However, weather conditions and diseases impact production efficiency, reducing economic activity and the food sovereignty of economies worldwide. Thus, computational methods can support disease classification based on an image. This classification requires training Artificial Intelligence (AI) models on high-performance computing resources, usually far from the user domain. State of the art has proposed the concept of Edge Computing (EC), which aims to bring computational resources closer to the domain problem to decrease application latency and improve computational power closer to the client. In addition, EC has become an enabling technology for Smart Farms, and the literature has appropriated EC to support these applications. However, predominantly state-of-the-art architectures are dependent on Internet connectivity and do not allow diverse real-time classification of diseases based on crop leaf on mobile devices.

Artificial intelligence (AI) has been experiencing rapid progress in the last few years, and it is becoming an important tool to address the impact and challenges of an aging population. Therefore, this research introduces population aging and artificial intelligence into agricultural production, focusing on the effects of population aging on food security and the function played by artificial intelligence in it. From an empirical study conducted based on provincial panel data, the following conclusions arise. First, population aging in rural China has not negatively impacted food security, so there is no need to be overly pessimistic about the inevitable aging of the rural population. Second, AI has a favorable moderating function on the effects of population aging on food security. Third, the moderating effect of AI is heterogeneous.

One of which is the diseases affecting the fishes being cultured on their farm. Maintaining sustained Health of the fishes is essential, failing which, these farmers are liable to suffer heavy losses. Manual observation by the trained farmers, plays a key role at present, to maintain sustained observation to detect the onset of a disease in the fish farming pen or pond.

"Flower Harvesting AGROBOT is a new innovative idea which is developed in concern with Farm Labours, in order to reduce the work and time consumption of labours. As we are aware of the saying that 'Farmers are the backbone of our country' hence we come up with new innovative model which helps the farmers. Generally flower plants will be having the harmful thorns which harms the flower plucking labours while plucking the flowers. Using the AGROBOT we can reduce this risk and harmness. This AGROBOT has been trained with more than 400 flower images, so it can easily detect the flowers in the plants and also able to recognize the healthy flowers using camera. These identified flowers will be compared with sampled flower images in Raspberry Pi memory. In this process if any damaged or dry flowers occurs then it will avoids the plucking of such flowers and hence reduces the time.

Those that are already implemented in rice farming include diseases and pest detection, prediction and estimation, and automated intelligent systems. In the proposed idea section, ideas to increase production are explored. Using advanced technologies may not be suitable for Indonesia's rice farmers. One argument is to minimize the differences in rice yield in different areas or so what we called yield gap. Factors such as weather, water, and harvest date are those with most impacts on the yield gap. It is beneficial to have a model that can predict the optimal planting date of rice since that will maximize the factors before.

"The only technology that is currently mature enough to help us quickly recover losses in agriculture is digital technology. Digital transformation is increasingly referred to as the fourth industrial revolution, aimed at merging the real world with the virtual one, bringing advantages even in traditional sectors such as agriculture. Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are used to analyze large amounts of data collected from various sources in the field, as well as from farmers or beneficiaries of European funds for agricultural sector development. Specifically, they can analyze information gathered from soil sensors, weather stations, satellite images, or European funding applications, among others. This analysis provides farmers with valuable information to make informed decisions regarding seed selection, optimal timing, planting techniques, and resource allocation decisions. At the same time, AI-powered systems can learn from historical data and identify patterns, enabling more accurate predictions and recommendations. Machine learning algorithms can anticipate managerial decisions, detect potential problems, and suggest appropriate interventions to improve financial performance for the successful implementation of projects funded by European funds.",14,10.2478/picbe-2024-0156,"This paper discusses the role of digital technology, particularly AI algorithms, in analyzing agricultural data to enhance decision-making for farmers.

"The study was carried out to identify various socio-economic factors influencing adoption of AI technology in the crossbreeding system at the farm household level. The Tobit regression for a data set of 245 sample farmers from three districts of Assam was used. The results showed that the education of the household head, accessing support from government dairy development programme, number of years since farmers first knew about AI and proportion of net dairy income positively and significantly affect extent of adoption of AI; while factors such as, distance to nearest market and risk perception of the farmers on AI negatively and statistically significantly influence extent of adoption of AI. The findings of the study suggested a package of interventions for increasing the use intensity of AI technology. These included, more specifically, the extension support to the farmers, market linkage, conducting awareness programme and direct support to the farmers to reduce the cost of farming.",14,10.5958/2322-0430.2018.00166.X,"This paper investigates the socio-economic factors that influence the adoption of AI technology in crossbreeding systems among farmers in Assam, using Tobit regression analysis on survey data.

"This article provides a review of recent research on agricultural insurance (AI) in developing countries. Agricultural producers face a variety of significant risks; historically, only government-subsidized products have achieved widespread adoption. A recent contractual innovation, which links insurance payouts to realized weather rather than farmer indemnity, has spurred substantial research in the past decade. This review begins by describing the experience in developed economies and then turns to developing countries, covering the following topics: farmers' adoption of AI, how AI affects their decision to invest in risky assets, and the extent to which AI helps farmers smooth income and consumption. We conclude with suggestions for future research and practice related to AI in developing countries.",14,10.1146/annurev-economics-080315-015225,"This article reviews research on agricultural insurance (AI) in developing countries, focusing on its adoption by farmers and its impact on their investment decisions and income smoothing.
