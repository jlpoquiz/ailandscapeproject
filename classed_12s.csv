"This paper proposes the concept of artificial intelligence co-piloted auditing, emphasizing the collaborative potential of auditors and foundation models in the auditing domain. The paper discusses the future relationship and interactions of human auditors and AI, imagining an audit setup where auditors’ capabilities are enhanced through artificial intelligence across a variety of audit tasks. To exemplify the potential of this co-piloted audit paradigm, we illustrate a systematic fine-tuning approach to foundation models using Chain-of-Thought prompting. This study showcases how foundation models can work as collaborators flexibly with auditors, enabling the model to accurately identify transactions from instructions. This study provides a detailed description of the formulated prompt protocols and the corresponding responses generated by ChatGPT, ensuring reproducibility. We envision this work as an initial step towards the widespread implementation of co-piloted auditing, paving the way for more efficient, accurate, and insightful audit procedures. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.",12,10.1016/j.accinf.2024.100698,"This paper introduces the concept of artificial intelligence co-piloted auditing, highlighting the collaborative potential between human auditors and AI foundation models.

"Leveraging ubiquitous digital data, advanced hardware, and sophisticated software, Big Data Analytics (BDA) enables unprecedented in-depth examination of business processes. This paper investigates how the Big 4 accounting firms promote their use of technology-enabled analytics in auditing practices on their official websites. We find that all the Big 4 market their audit analytics as offering operational insights that add value for clients. Historically, auditors have sought to share valuable perspectives gained during engagements beyond verifying that clients are in compliance with accounting principles. However, providing these value-adding insights is transitioning from a supplementary benefit to an essential selling point of audits. This behavior likely stems from BDA technology's inherent duality–facilitating regulatory compliance and business intelligence. Incorporating artificial intelligence into audit firms’ technological arsenal will further enhance their ability to deliver client-valued insights. These developments necessitate further research into how the BDA application impacts auditor independence. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.",12,10.1016/j.accinf.2024.100697,"This paper investigates how the Big 4 accounting firms promote their use of Big Data Analytics (BDA) in auditing practices through their official websites.

"The present study aims to explore the factors influencing the utilization of Information audit in the context of Egypt and Jordan, with specific attention given to the role of artificial intelligence (AI). A sample of 443 respondents participated in the study, and data collection was carried out through a non-probability convenience and snowball sampling approach. The findings reveal that internal determinants are positively associated with the intention to adopt Information audit technologies, exhibiting a significant impact with a beta coefficient of +0.45 (P-value < 0.01), and the perceived benefits associated with their implementation. Moreover, the study underscores the critical influence of artificial intelligence, with dimensions such as cloud computing, data mining, and e-commerce enhancing the perceived advantages (β = 0.35, P-value < 0.01) and fostering the intent to use Information audit technologies (β = 0.22, P-value < 0.01). Additionally, there is a robust positive correlation between the intention to use Information audit technologies and their actual usage, where the presence of AI amplifies this association, indicated by a beta value of 0.48 (P-value < 0.01). This study significantly enriches the existing body of knowledge by delineating the determinants of Information audit usage, particularly within the Middle Eastern context, and highlights the pivotal role of artificial intelligence in shaping these dynamics. The study provides empirical evidence on the factors influencing the intention to use Information audit technologies, the perceived benefits associated with their usage, and the actual utilization of Information audit. Its originality lies in its focus on the underexplored Middle East region within the Information audit literature and its investigation of the influence of artificial intelligence on Information audit. The implications of this study are significant for practitioners, auditors, and policymakers operating within the Middle East region.

"In this study, we examine whether the use of artificial intelligence (AI) can reduce the effect of independence conflicts on audit firm liability. In two experiments, we manipulate (1) whether procedures are performed by a human auditor or with AI and (2) whether the audit firm was careful in maintaining the appearance of independence from the audit client. Results of both experiments indicate that the use of AI significantly reduces the impact of the appearance of independence conflicts on jurors' judgments of audit firm liability. When concerns relating to the appearance of independence conflicts are present, the use of AI helps maintain the perceived objectivity of the auditor, which results in jurors maintaining higher overall trust in the audit process.

"Purpose: This study aims to explore some perceptions related to the suggestion that external auditors will be replaced by audit technologies that use artificial intelligence (AI) tools to make audit judgements when performing the financial statement audits. Digital transformation is revitalising the technologies used by external auditors and their firms; thus, the authors seek to understand what challenges this creates for the auditing profession in Vietnam. Design/methodology/approach: Through the theoretical lens of new institutionalism theory, this study uses a qualitative approach involving 20 semi-structured interviews conducted with external auditors in Vietnam during 2022. This sample includes the global Big Four, global mid-tier and smaller local Vietnamese audit firms. Findings: The findings indicate that there is resistance or disagreement with the suggestion that in the future audit technologies using AI tools can replace humans (external auditors). The role of external auditors in the professional services sector will gradually be changed by audit technologies; however, external auditors are unlikely to be replaced by audit technologies that use AI tools based on the responses of the participants. Strict institutional rules that exist in Vietnam would prevent the replacement of (human) external auditors. In the future, external auditors may take on new roles as consultants, with unique skills in classifying and processing data for decision-making processes; however, they will not be completely replaced by technology in the audit space. Research limitations/implications: This study has limitations that it is based on the data collection from a single developing country, Vietnam; therefore, the generalisability of the findings is limited to Vietnam. Also, the authors sought insights into the future of external audits in Vietnam. Practical implications: This study highlights the changing role of auditors and institutions. Thus, policymakers, external auditors and auditees in other developing countries would find the findings helpful. Originality/value: This study provides new perspectives, particularly from local Vietnamese firms, about audit practices that emerge due to high-level technological advancements and then embed themselves into existing audit practices in an emerging economy.

"We manually collect data on auditors with artificial intelligence (AI) educational backgrounds comprising 8201 company-year observations of A-share listed companies in China between 2014 and 2020. We then develop an auditor individual-level setting to investigate the role of AI education in audit report timeliness. Results show auditors with AI educational backgrounds are negatively and significantly associated with audit report lag, indicating auditors with AI education can shorten annual audit report times by using programming, applied technology, and logical-thinking skills, thereby enhancing audit report timeliness. In addition, this timeliness effect is more pronounced in accounting firms with more branches and among state-owned enterprises, and higher-risk clients. Furthermore, AI education and Certified Public Accountant status can complementarily strengthen this effect, particularly in companies with higher client portfolio risk.

"Financial reconciliation (cross-checking independent sources of data) is a time-honored and widespread function in finance and audit. Its objectives are to ensure completeness, timeliness, and accuracy of recording of transactions. With the proliferation of data over recent decades, the ways in which reconciliation is approached have evolved. There are now a number of software products that promise to automate the process of detailed transaction matching. However, the 'state of the art' in these products is rules-based reconciliation. Rules-based systems in any domain tend to be brittle in that any change in the data streams causes the rules to have to be debugged and rebuilt, itself often a time-consuming process. And to make matters worse, this might be caused not just by data schema changes, but the contents of what is in the data fields themselves. Either of these can occur if a third party such as a bank changes its internal processes. In a sense, automated reconciliation is where machine translation was almost 70 years ago; IBM's 1954 Georgetown experiment approached Russian-to-English translation using rules, but it took another 4 decades for researchers in data-driven Artificial Intelligence (AI) to realize why machine translation did not initially live up to its promises and develop a truly robust methodology for machine translation based on unsupervised learning. It turns out that financial reconciliation can be cast as a machine translation problem based on unsupervised learning. To our knowledge, we are the first to propose this. Here, we demonstrate via experiments on real-life (albeit small-scale) financial data that this way of approaching the problem demonstrates promise in terms of accuracy, as well as solving the problem of lack of robustness inherent in rules-based approaches.  © 2020 ACM.",12,10.1145/3383455.3422517,"This paper proposes a new approach to financial reconciliation by framing it as a machine translation problem that utilizes unsupervised learning, addressing the limitations of current rules-based systems.

"Purpose: The advent of technology has propelled audit firms to incorporate AI-based audit services, bringing the relationship between audit clients and firms into sharper focus. Nonetheless, the understanding of how AI-based audit services affect this relationship remains sparse. This study strives to probe how an audit client's satisfaction with AI-based audit services influences their trust in audit firms. Identifying the variables affecting this trust, the research aspires to gain a deeper comprehension of the implications of AI-based audit services on the auditor-client relationship, ultimately aiming to boost client satisfaction and cultivate trust. Design/methodology/approach: A conceptual framework has been devised, grounded in the client-company relationship model, to delineate the relationship between perceived quality, perceived value, attitude and satisfaction with AI-based audit services and their subsequent impact on trust in audit firms. The research entailed an empirical investigation employing Facebook ads, gathering 288 valid responses for evaluation. The structural equation method, utilized in conjunction with SPSS and Amos statistical applications, verified the reliability and overarching structure of the scales employed to measure these elements. A hybrid multi-analytical technique of structural equation modeling and artificial neural networks (SEM-ANN) was deployed to empirically validate the collated data. Findings: The research unveiled a significant and positive relationship between perceived value and client satisfaction, trust and attitude towards AI-based audit services, along with the link between perceived quality and client satisfaction. The findings suggest that a favorable attitude and perceived quality of AI-based audit services could enhance satisfaction, subsequently augmenting perceived value and client trust. By focusing on the delivery of superior-quality services that fulfill clients' value expectations, firms may amplify client satisfaction and trust. Research limitations/implications: Further inquiries are required to appraise the influence of advanced technology adoption within audit firms on client trust-building mechanisms. Moreover, an understanding of why the impact of perceived quality on perceived value proves ineffectual in the context of audit client trust-building warrants further exploration. In interpreting the findings of this study, one should consider the inherent limitations of the empirical analysis, inclusive of the utilization of Facebook ads as a data-gathering tool. Practical implications: The research yielded insightful theoretical and practical implications that can bolster audit clients' trust in audit firms amid technological advancements within the audit landscape. The results imply that audit firms should contemplate implementing trust-building mechanisms by creating value and influencing clients' stance towards AI-based audit services to establish trust, particularly when vying with competing firms. As technological evolutions impinge on trustworthiness, audit firms must prioritize clients' perceived value and satisfaction. Originality/value: To the researcher's best knowledge, no previous study has scrutinized the impact of satisfaction with AI-based audit services on cultivating audit client trust in audit firms, in contrast to past research that has focused on the auditors' trust in the audit client.

"Purpose: In a virtual interconnected digital space, the metaverse encompasses various virtual environments where people can interact, including engaging in business activities. Machine learning (ML) is a strategic technology that enables digital transformation to the metaverse, and it is becoming a more prevalent driver of business performance and reporting on performance. However, ML has limitations, and using the technology in business processes, such as accounting, poses a technology governance failure risk. To address this risk, decision makers and those tasked to govern these technologies must understand where the technology fits into the business process and consider its limitations to enable a governed transition to the metaverse. Using selected accounting processes, this study aims to describe the limitations that ML techniques pose to ensure the quality of financial information. Design/methodology/approach: A grounded theory literature review method, consisting of five iterative stages, was used to identify the accounting tasks that ML could perform in the respective accounting processes, describe the ML techniques that could be applied to each accounting task and identify the limitations associated with the individual techniques. Findings: This study finds that limitations such as data availability and training time may impact the quality of the financial information and that ML techniques and their limitations must be clearly understood when developing and implementing technology governance measures.

"Recent literature shows that adopting an accounting information system (AIS) can lead to better decision-making, planning, efficiency and on-time management control, and organisational functionality. However, the impact of AIS implementation on role creation in the organisation is unclear. With the digital transformation of AIS and daily advances in machine learning and other innovative technologies, it is also unclear how these changes interact with human roles in organisations and which AIS components are considered essential. This paper addresses the above issues by applying the actor-network theory to examine the impact of deep machine learning modules in predicting the human actor roles in accounting information systems in organisations. We targeted 120 human actors and examined the influence of deep machine learning modules in predicting 11 personnel and professional features of human actors, based on multivariate statistical analysis. Our findings show that two human factors (familiarity with accounting information and time spent on becoming familiar with it) are the most influential elements that can predict the human actor roles in accounting information systems in organisations. So, human and non-human actors are both essential parts of an integrated AIS that must be considered. The current literature has focused on the AIS structure with less on the interaction between human and non-human actors. One of the main contributions of this study is providing evidence that AIS heavily relies on its human and non-human actors to form a coherent and united AIS network to promote AIS management strategies. The practical implication of the results is that investing in either technology or human resources alone is not enough to achieve the best productivity and performance in organisations. Instead, there must be a balance between human and non-human actors. © 2023 by the authors.",12,10.3390/jrfm16010037,"This paper investigates the interaction between human roles and deep machine learning modules within accounting information systems (AIS) using actor-network theory.

"Discourse proclaiming the advent of a fourth industrial revolution predicts significant disruption to various work domains in the near future. Auditing is one of the domains where bold claims about the potential of technology are being made, with technology expected to augment auditors' judgments and, in time, possibly automate them. Drawing on 44 in-depth interviews with auditors, regulators, and emergent artificial intelligence software providers, we question the prevailing narrative around technological change in auditing which suggests that ostensibly simple, low-level technical tasks are areas where little judgment is at play and thus are ripe for automation. We show that significant elements of deliberation, sensemaking, and reflexivity, arguably critical for the socialization of early career auditors into the profession, may be lost when automating areas of work perceived as low value, leading us to question what it means to apply judgment in auditing. Conversely, higher-level aspects of the audit process may be assisted by technology and augmented in different ways, yet new technological structures generate new areas of indeterminacy that pose new and yet unresolved demands on auditors' judgment.

To understand the impact of AI and ML, various factors influencing the use of AI and ML and the challenges were considered. Data were collected from 169 respondents spanning across all sectors in Oman using a structured questionnaire. The collected data were analyzed using correlation to determine the relationship between AI and ML-assisted auditing practices and professional skepticism and professional judgment. Results indicate that AI and ML-assisted auditing practices have a strong positive relationship with professional skepticism and professional judgment. This proves that AI andML have an impact on professional skepticism and professional judgment. Moreover, it helps in improving the detection of errors and material misstatements. Even though the advantages of AI and ML outweigh manual auditing, the complete replacement of human beings with AI and ML should be considered with caution. Hence, auditing must be carried out with the help of AI and ML along with human intervention in improving auditing efficiency.  © 2021 by authors.",12,10.13189/ujaf.2021.090527,"This paper investigates the impact of AI and ML on the professional skepticism and judgment of internal auditors, focusing on how these technologies improve audit efficiency.

"Purpose: With the help of “self-learning” algorithms and high computing power, companies are transforming Big Data into artificial intelligence (AI)-powered information and gaining economic benefits. AI-powered information and Big Data (simply data henceforth) have quickly become some of the most important strategic resources in the global economy. However, their value is not (yet) formally recognized in financial statements, which leads to a growing gap between book and market values and thus limited decision usefulness of the underlying financial statements. The objective of this paper is to identify ways in which the value of data can be reported to improve decision usefulness. Design/methodology/approach: Based on the authors' experience as both long-term practitioners and theoretical accounting scholars, the authors conceptualize and draw up a potential data value chain and show the transformation from raw Big Data to business-relevant AI-powered information during its process. Findings: Analyzing current International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) regulations and their applicability, the authors show that current regulations are insufficient to provide useful information on the value of data. Following this, the authors propose a Framework for AI-powered Information and Big Data (FAIIBD) Reporting. This framework also provides insights on the (good) governance of data with the purpose of increasing decision usefulness and connecting to existing frameworks even further. In the conclusion, the authors raise questions concerning this framework that may be worthy of discussion in the scholarly community. Research limitations/implications: Scholars and practitioners alike are invited to follow up on the conceptual framework from many perspectives. Practical implications: The framework can serve as a guide towards a better understanding of how to recognize and report AI-powered information and by that (a) limit the valuation gap between book and market value and (b) enhance decision usefulness of financial reporting.

"With technological advances, audit firms have been able to increase the level of decision support embedded within the firms’ audit support tools (Dowling et al., 2008). Large audit firms have been investing substantive resources into the utilization of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to take advantage of their past audit experience and industry knowledge (Kokina and Davenport, 2017; Appelbaum, 2017). During the initial stages of an audit, the engagement team will meet to update their understanding of the client through brainstorming sessions. Audit firms are required by SAS No. 99 and SAS No. 109 to use brainstorming sessions to evaluate risk factors and discuss the susceptibility of the entity’s financial statements to material misstatement, either as a result of error or fraud (AICPA, 2012). At present, the most commonly used decision support tool for audit plan brainstorming is the checklist (Bellovary and Johnstone, 2007), which has shown limitations (Dowling and Leech, 2007; Seow, 2011; Landis, 2008). To improve audit plan effectiveness, this study proposes an audit domain cognitive assistant system to provide interactive decision support for information retrieval and risk assessment in audit brainstorming session.

"Recent advances in technology have accelerated digitalization and intelligence in modern business. Particularly, the increasing use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in managerial accounting is expected to accurately measure corporate performance, provide intelligent analyses, and predict the future of a company. However, along with the benefits, ethical concerns of using AI also arise, such as deprofessionalization, data breach, and isolation among accountants. This paper explores the ethical impact of AI in managerial accounting at both pre- and post-adoption stages. Based on 47 interviews conducted with companies, an AI system vendor, and regulators, we found that data security, privacy, and misuse; accountability; accessibility; benefits and challenges; and transparency and trust of AI are among the most common ethical risks in the development and use of AI in managerial accounting.

"In today’s big-data era, enterprises are able to generate complex and non-structured information that could cause considerable challenges for CPA firms in data analysis and to issue improper audited reports within the required period. Artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled auditing technology not only facilitates accurate and comprehensive auditing for CPA firms, but is also a major breakthrough in auditing’s new environment. Applications of an AI-enabled auditing technique in external auditing can add to auditing efficiency, increase financial reporting accountability, ensure audit quality, and assist decision-makers in making reliable decisions. Strategies related to the adoption of an AI-enabled auditing technique by CPA firms cover the classical multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) task (i.e., several perspectives/criteria must be considered). To address this critical task, the present study proposes a fusion multiple rule-based decision making (MRDM) model that integrates rule-based technique (i.e., the fuzzy rough set theory (FRST) with ant colony optimization (ACO)) into MCDM techniques that can assist decision makers in selecting the best methods necessary to achieve the aspired goals of audit success.

"The implementation of the tasks of evaluating historical financial information, the control or audit of business activities are based primarily on professional judgments about the object of study of a professional accountant or auditor. Their findings are drawn on the review of documents, the use of audit evidence, risk assessment, etc. There is always a probability (and rather high) that professional judgment will be based on incomplete information (since the dynamics of information changes is extremely high today), on the misstatements (since it is impossible to trace all the changes in knowledge related to the object of study), regardless of the quality of the performance of these individuals. In addition, the auditor often takes subjective decisions (for example, when choosing individual elements for the assessment from the general population), which also affects the degree of objectivity of his assessments. Artificial intelligence is the tool that could handle the entire set of knowledge, track all changes in the significant and important information, as well as in the insignificant and unimportant (which, however, also has an effect on the object of analysis). It does not have a work schedule or other restrictions on the time of work, so the comparison and analysis of information can be carried out around the clock, and the speed of data processing is determined by the processing power of the information systems, on which it operates, and is stably high.

"Purpose: This paper aims to identify ethical challenges of using artificial intelligence (AI)-based accounting systems for decision-making and discusses its findings based on Rest's four-component model of antecedents for ethical decision-making. This study derives implications for accounting and auditing scholars and practitioners. Design/methodology/approach: This research is rooted in the hermeneutics tradition of interpretative accounting research, in which the reader and the texts engage in a form of dialogue. To substantiate this dialogue, the authors conduct a theoretically informed, narrative (semi-systematic) literature review spanning the years 2015–2020. This review's narrative is driven by the depicted contexts and the accounting/auditing practices found in selected articles are used as sample instead of the research or methods. Findings: In the thematic coding of the selected papers the authors identify five major ethical challenges of AI-based decision-making in accounting: objectivity, privacy, transparency, accountability and trustworthiness. Using Rest's component model of antecedents for ethical decision-making as a stable framework for our structure, the authors critically discuss the challenges and their relevance for a future human–machine collaboration within varying agency between humans and AI. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the literature on accounting as a subjectivising as well as mediating practice in a socio-material context. It does so by providing a solid base of arguments that AI alone, despite its enabling and mediating role in accounting, cannot make ethical accounting decisions because it lacks the necessary preconditions in terms of Rest's model of antecedents. What is more, as AI is bound to pre-set goals and subjected to human made conditions despite its autonomous learning and adaptive practices, it lacks true agency. As a consequence, accountability needs to be shared between humans and AI.

"Audit firms are investing billions of dollars to develop artificial intelligence (AI) systems that will help auditors execute challenging tasks (e.g., evaluating complex estimates). Although firms assume AI will enhance audit quality, a growing body of research documents that individuals often exhibit “algorithm aversion”—the tendency to discount computer-based advice more heavily than human advice, although the advice is identical otherwise. Therefore, we conduct an experiment to examine how algorithm aversion manifests in auditor judgments. Consistent with theory, we find that auditors receiving contradictory evidence from their firm's AI system (instead of a human specialist) propose smaller adjustments to management's complex estimates, particularly when management develops their estimates using relatively objective (vs. subjective) inputs.

The paper uses a data set from an interventionist case study of a machinery manufacturer. Findings: We examine an actual process of automating management accounting tasks. During this development process, surprisingly, calculation tasks remained more fit for humans than machines though, initially, they were thought to be programmable.

"Purpose: This paper aims to explore how the maieutic role of management accounting (MA) can be sustained in the context of MA digitalization. Design/methodology/approach: The paper begins with practitioners’ descriptions of the context that makes the MA support of non-routine decisions maieutic. To understand how the maieutic characteristics can be sustained in future MA digitalization, the authors then analyze the discourses these practitioners have about artificial intelligence (AI) in providing MA support. Findings: As a basis, the authors’ data show various maieutic characteristics within the use of MA answers in decision-making as well as within the MA process of generating such answers. The paper then identifies three MA digitalization discourses, namely, “computation,” “judgment” and human-AI “interaction” discourse, each with their unique agendas on how AI should be used. Originality/value: The paper is based on the premises that AI and digitalization are often discussed without sufficient understanding about the context being digitalized. The authors’ data suggest that MA support in non-routine decision-making is fundamentally maieutic, and AI – as it currently stands – is not expected to change this by providing perfect answers. The authors provide novel insights about maieutic MA support and the current discourses on using AI in MA support, and how digitalization does not necessarily compromise maieutic MA support but instead has the potential to sustain or even enhance it. © 2024, Vesa Tiitola, Tuomas Jalonen, Mirva Rantanen-Flores, Tuomas Korhonen, Johanna Ruusuvuori and Teemu Laine.",12,10.1108/QRAM-11-2022-0198,"This paper explores the impact of AI and digitalization on the maieutic role of management accounting (MA) in supporting non-routine decision-making.

"Automation—such as machine learning, robotic process automation, and artificial intelligence—is the next major technological leap in accounting and financial reporting, and I empirically study whether public firms’ use of automation technology improves their financial reporting, specifically focusing on the internal control environment. I document two critical inferences. First, I find evidence which suggests that automation improves financial reporting quality. Specifically, firms’ use of automation in the financial reporting process is associated with a reduction in internal control material weaknesses. This association is consistent in a levels analysis with firm and year fixed effects, in a changes analysis, and in a propensity score matched difference-in-differences analysis. Second, I find evidence which suggests that monitoring of the financial reporting process decreases after automation, likely because of a perception that automation reduces the need for monitoring vis-à-vis stronger internal controls. Specifically, automation is associated with higher external audit fees and audit committee meetings in the initial years after a firm implements automation but associated with lower external audit fees and audit committee meetings in subsequent years. I also find evidence which suggests that this decreased monitoring may be costly: when internal control failures do happen for firms with automation, the failures are more material, as proxied by stronger negative market reactions. In aggregate, my evidence provides nuanced insights regarding whether automation technology improves financial reporting. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.",12,10.1007/s11142-024-09822-y,"This paper empirically investigates the impact of automation technologies, including AI, on the quality of financial reporting and the internal control environment in public firms.

"This systematic literature review examines how researchers have evaluated the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Management Accounting (MA), focusing on process and impact evaluations. The findings of the nine recent research papers completed between 2019 and 2023 were incorporated in this review. The study followed a three-phase, structured process: planning the review, conducting it, and reporting the findings. The study utilized multiple databases to source relevant papers and applied stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria, followed by a thematic synthesis approach. The results showed that the reviewed articles highlighted four aspects of AI in MA process evaluation: technological acceptance and usability, ethical and security considerations, skills and competence, and the decision-making process. Two aspects were pinpointed under impact evaluation in the reviewed articles: enhancement of accounting practices and the evolution of roles and skills. Two important predictions that the papers repeatedly asserted were that AI adoption in MA is still in its early stages but will transform the field soon. It will dramatically enhance MA practices, creating new challenges and skills requiring urgent attention. Ethical and security considerations were also stressed in the reviewed articles. As AI algorithms are developing rapidly, the findings are limited to only giving a broad picture of the recent state of the field. However, this paper identified aspects of AI in MA evaluation that should contribute to setting evaluation criteria, which would be helpful for future assessments.

We examine this potential in the context of data analytic-driven audits mandated to reduce fraud, waste, and abuse in a government-sponsored healthcare program. To do so, we draw on semistructured interviews with healthcare providers (i.e., auditees) subject to healthcare audits. Our work shows how use of paraprofessional auditors guided by AI-enabled tools and analytics reflects a very different audit environment. Specifically, auditees’ experiences suggest paraprofessional auditors lack specific expertise and credentials to conduct data-driven audits, apply judgment in deference to technology, and disregard the impact of AI-driven decisions on the public interest.

"Recently artificial intelligence (AI) spring has been brought about by the needs from the aging world as well as advances of the deep learning technologies. Japan is the world's most aged country: 33 percent of its population were aged 60 years or over in 2017. The population aging and population decline contribute to a decline in growth potential. Recalling the growth accounting equation, productivity, neither capital nor labor, is strongly desired to increase. This success depends on how effectively AI makes use of capital and labor, especially labor. AI is expected to supplement human workforce rather than to take place of it. Because AI is not a natural person who has his or her autonomous will, its learning is under control of some natural person. This paper proposes a management framework for AI to supplement human workforce. By looking back the AI history, the proposed management framework integrates statistical knowledge derived from machine learning and deterministic expertise obtained from expert systems. To evaluate the effectiveness of this proposal, this paper analyses expert system and machine learning applications in auditing.

"How does artificial intelligence (AI) impact audit quality and efficiency? We explore this question by leveraging a unique dataset of more than 310,000 detailed individual resumes for the 36 largest audit firms to identify audit firms’ employment of AI workers. We provide a first look into the AI workforce within the auditing sector. AI workers tend to be male and relatively young and hold mostly but not exclusively technical degrees. Importantly, AI is a centralized function within the firm, with workers concentrating in a handful of teams and geographic locations. Our results show that investing in AI helps improve audit quality, reduces fees, and ultimately displaces human auditors, although the effect on labor takes several years to materialize. Specifically, a one-standard-deviation change in recent AI investments is associated with a 5.0% reduction in the likelihood of an audit restatement, a 0.9% drop in audit fees, and a reduction in the number of accounting employees that reaches 3.6% after three years and 7.1% after four years. Our empirical analyses are supported by in-depth interviews with 17 audit partners representing the eight largest U.S. public accounting firms, which show that (1) AI is developed centrally; (2) AI is widely used in audit; and (3) the primary goal for using AI in audit is improved quality, followed by efficiency. © 2022, The Author(s).",12,10.1007/s11142-022-09697-x,"This paper investigates the impact of AI on audit quality and efficiency by analyzing a dataset of over 310,000 resumes from major audit firms and conducting interviews with audit partners.

"Purpose: Algorithms, artificial intelligence (AI), machines, and all emerging digital technologies disrupt traditional auditing, raising many questions and debates. One of the central issues of this debate is the human-algorithms complex duality, which focuses on this investigation. This study aims to investigate the algorithms’ penetration in auditing activities, with a specific focus of a future scenario on the human-algorithms interaction in performing audits as intelligent teams. Design/methodology/approach: The research uses a qualitative reflexive thematic analysis, taking into consideration the academic literature, as well as professional reports and websites of the “Big Four” audit firms and internationally recognized accounting bodies. Findings: The results debate the complex duality between algorithms and human-based actions in the institutional settings of auditing activities by highlighting the actual stage of algorithms, machines and AI emergence in audit and providing real-life examples of their use in the audit. Furthermore, they emphasize the strengths and weaknesses of algorithms compared to human beings. Based on the results, a discussion on the human-algorithms interaction from the lens of the Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) approach concludes that the Auditor-Governing-the-Loop may be a possible scenario for the future of the auditing profession.

"Purpose: This study aims to examine whether clients’ degree of digitalization and audit firms’ expertise in information technology (IT) influence audit quality (AQ). Design/methodology/approach: Data of Chinese A-share firms listed on the primary board of the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges from 2011 to 2019 are taken as the sample. All the data are obtained from the China Stock Market and Accounting Research. Clients’ digitalization is determined using the keywords “AI technology,” “blockchain,” “cloud computing,” “big data technology” and “digital technology.” Auditor firm’s digital expertise is determined by the proportion of higher IT expertise. As the proxy for AQ, this study uses audit fees, given that its quantum reflects the effort auditors expend that in turn affects the AQ. Findings: A fixed-effect regression model shows that clients with high digitalization attain AQ. This study also finds a significant and positive coefficient of audit fees, indicating that AQ is high in the same situation if an audit firm’s IT is mature and developed. Furthermore, results confirm the moderating effect of clients’ digitalization and auditors’ expertise and on AQ. Auditors’ expertise in IT mitigates the audit risk and increase AQ.

"Compliance management for procurement internal auditing has been a major challenge for public sectors due to its tedious period of manual audit history and large-scale paper-based repositories. Many practical issues and potential risks arise during the manual audit process, including a low level of efficiency, accuracy, accountability, high expense and its laborious and time consuming nature. To alleviate these problems, this paper proposes a continuous compliance awareness framework (CoCAF). It is defined as an AI-based automated approach to conduct procurement compliance auditing. CoCAF is used to automatically and timely audit an organisation’s purchases by intelligently understanding compliance policies and extracting the required information from purchasing evidence using text extraction technologies, automatic processing methods and a report rating system. Based on the auditing results, the CoCAF can provide a continuously updated report demonstrating the compliance level of the procurement with statistics and diagrams. The CoCAF is evaluated on a real-life procurement data set, and results show that it can process 500 purchasing pieces of evidence within five minutes and provide 95.6% auditing accuracy, demonstrating its high efficiency, quality and assurance level in procurement internal audit. © 2020 by the authors.

"Purpose: The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) in the accounting landscape marks a significant shift, promising gains in efficiency and accuracy but also eliciting concerns about job displacement (JD) and broader socio-economic implications. This study aims to provide an in-depth understanding of how AI’s integration in accounting contributes to JD, reshapes decision-making processes and reverberates across economic and social dimensions. It also offers evidence-based policy recommendations to mitigate adverse outcomes. Design/methodology/approach: Leveraging a cross-sectional survey disseminated through Facebook, this research used snowball sampling to target a diverse cohort of accounting professionals. The collected data were subjected to meticulous analysis through descriptive and regression models, facilitated by SmartPLS 4 software. Findings: The analysis revealed a significant correlation between AI’s increasing role in accounting and a heightened rate of JD. This study found that this displacement is not isolated; it has tangible repercussions on decision-making paradigms, economic well-being, professional work dynamics and social structures. These insights corroborate existing frameworks, including, but not limited to, theories of technological unemployment and behavioural adjustments. Research limitations/implications: Although providing valuable insights, this study acknowledges limitations such as the restricted sample size, the cross-sectional nature of the survey and the inherent biases of self-reported data. Future research could aim to extend these initial findings by adopting a longitudinal approach and potentially integrating external data sources. Practical implications: As AI technology becomes increasingly ingrained in accounting practices, there is an urgent need for coordinated action among stakeholders. Policy recommendations include focused efforts on talent retention, investment in upskilling programs and the establishment of support mechanisms for those adversely affected by AI adoption. Originality/value: By synthesising a range of theoretical perspectives, this study offers a comprehensive exploration of AI’s multi-dimensional impacts on the accounting profession. It stands out for its nuanced examination of JD and its economic and social implications, thereby contributing to both academic discourse and policy formulation.
