"The accurate estimation of construction waste (CW) is vital for promoting sustainable construction practices. Traditional estimation approaches rely on manual calculations that consider factors such as floor area, building type, and other relevant parameters. Empirical equations are then employed to estimate the quantity of CW generated, but the accuracy of these strategies is typically low. However, machine learning (ML) algorithms have made significant breakthroughs in estimation accuracy, exceeding 90%. This paper investigates trained ML models that can be employed in CW estimation, using a Tabuk city, Saudi Arabia, as a case study. The models undergo rigorous validation and testing through a variety of evaluation metrics such as residuals, mean square error, root mean square error, and coefficient of determination (R2-score). The R2-score values, ranging from 0.88 to 0.98 for both the training and testing datasets, demonstrate that ML algorithm models can make reliable and accurate predictions of CW quantities. Furthermore, these results indicate that utilizing these algorithms can help in developing efficient techniques for managing CW, leading to reduced environmental, economic, and societal effects. The potential applications for these ML algorithms in the construction sector are extensive and mark a promising step forward in promoting sustainability and implementing effective waste management practices within the industry in Saudi Arabia and beyond.

"Project management methods and practice address project success and the well-known “iron triangle” targeting time, cost, and quality trade-off have great importance in this process. Quality optimization, including safety and sustainability, plays a key role in construction project management choices. Since the relationship between quality, time and cost can be different from case to case, an application of artificial intelligence (AI) has been proposed for this purpose. The objective of the research work in this chapter is to demonstrate that AI applications can help project managers the trade-off between time, cost, and quality objectives. A comprehensive approach concerning three estimates of time, cost, and quality of project activities is proposed to optimize project performance in construction. The proposed approach implements a genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize project performances, with the aim of creating a decision support system for construction project managers. Genetic algorithm is an AI application that creates a learning optimization process that discards worse solutions and re-introduces better solutions to search for an optimal or sub-optimal solution. Therefore, time, cost, and quality trade-off can be performed by a multi-objective genetic algorithm that evaluates the effectiveness of various combinations, selecting better solutions with an iterative process. Therefore, the most suitable balance between the three project targets can be achieved. A simple case study of a deep renovation project of two residential is presented to evaluate the proposed approach with a sample application. This study contributes to the understanding of AI applications for construction management. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",0,10.1007/978-3-031-25498-7_14,"This paper proposes an AI application using a genetic algorithm to optimize the trade-offs between time, cost, and quality in construction project management.

"Literature has increasingly recognized that manufacturing companies should implement a synergic bundle of solutions to fully exploit the potential of Industry 4.0 (I4.0), rather than opting for a scattered technological adoption. Enabling I4.0 technologies, such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and additive manufacturing, can be implemented through various combinations to achieve different impacts on a company's performance. But what are the possible ways of combining I4.0 technologies into bundles, and do these ways actually help to achieve a performance that outperforms the adoption of single technologies? This study aims to identify the potential patterns of the technological complementary of I4.0 by considering enabled applications and performance outcomes. We interviewed 13 Italian experts in the I4.0 field, and then combined the obtained information with secondary data collected from more than 150 I4.0 use cases, as well as from websites, reports and press releases. By adopting a systems theory lens, the results of the analysis have allowed us to identify the specific performance effects of both scattered and joint technological adoptions in different application areas. Interestingly, specific examples of I4.0 complementarities emerged, namely full, hybrid and platform complementarity. This study contributes to the growing research on I4.0 outcomes by extending the concept of technological complementary within the I4.0 context.

"The empowerment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in manufacturing has drawn considerable attention, yet a holistic understanding of AI's effects on manufacturers' resilience and performance remains elusive. Our research leverages organizational information processing theory to explore the impact of three AI types – cognitive insights, process automation, and cognitive engagement – on manufacturers' resilience and performance. Our findings unveil that AI-driven process automation and cognitive engagement significantly influence both planned and adaptive resilience among manufacturers, while AI for cognitive insights predominantly elevates planned resilience without substantial effects on adaptive resilience. Moreover, our study establishes a positive link between planned and adaptive resilience and manufacturers' operational performance. By enhancing the comprehension of AI's implications for organizational resilience, our research yields crucial managerial insights and fresh perspectives for industry practitioners. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",0,10.1016/j.ijpe.2024.109175,"This research examines the effects of different types of AI on manufacturers' resilience and performance, utilizing organizational information processing theory.

"The mining industry contributes to the expansion of the global economy by generating vital commodities. For continuous production, the industry relies significantly on machinery and equipment, which, as a result of greater modernization, are becoming increasingly complex, with a variety of systems and subsystems. However, maintaining the machinery and equipment used in the mining industry can be complex and costly. To improve the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) technologies for equipment maintenance and to determine the best maintenance strategies, a systematic literature review was conducted to summarise the current state of research on equipment-related predictive maintenance (RP) in the mining industry. The review provides an overview of maintenance practices in the mining sector and examines PdM methodologies and processes used in other industries that may be applicable to the mining industry. In addition, this study discusses the different PdM architectures, processes, phases, and models (statistical and ML-based) used in creating a PdM plan.

"Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly discussed as an innovation enabler for the enhancement of circular economy (CE) approaches in industries. The further deployment of intelligent technologies is considered to be very promising particularly in remanufacturing, which can be regarded as an implementation approach of CE at a firm level. AI’s potential to contribute to advancements in remanufacturing can be traced back to these modern technologies’ extended capacities of supporting and assisting humans during rather manual processes which are regarded as more common in remanufacturing than in traditional linear production. As a result, we argue that in future application scenarios, humans are going to interact more often with AI agents who may direct and assist humans’ behaviour and decision-making processes. We assume that a better understanding of the specific dynamics and novel aspects of these kind of newly emerging human-AI systems is a key prerequisite for sustainable process innovation, particularly in remanufacturing organisations. However, empirical-based contributions about humans’ behavioural changes in interaction with AI agents have so far been rather rare and limited, especially in the field of remanufacturing and CE. In this article, we seek to contribute to this gap in research by exploring the interaction between shop floor workers and an AI agent based on a case study research approach at a plant of a German automotive supplier that is remanufacturing used parts. We conducted semi-structured interviews among the shop floor workers who are involved in a joint decision-making task with an AI agent. We interpret the findings of our qualitative data in the light of related research in the field of AI in CE, AI implementation in organisation and human-AI interaction literature. In summary, our analysis reveals 13 behavioural patterns that shop floor workers reported on referring to their interaction with the AI agent. The behavioural patterns are systemised into a cognitive, emotional and social dimension of a competence framework. These findings shall contribute to a more specific understanding about how humans interact with AI agents at work, while considering the specific context variables of the interaction paradigm and the AI agent’s role during joint decision-making in a human-AI system. Implications for literature in the field of human-AI interaction as well as AI implementation in organisations with a particular focus on CE are discussed. © 2023 The Author(s).

"This study develops a model supported by the dynamic capability theory to analyze the role of artificial intelligence-enabled dynamic capability in environmental performance and the mediation of a data-driven culture. We collected data from supply chain managers in France and the USA. The data was analyzed and validated through classical structural equation modeling using the lavaan R package. The results suggest that artificial intelligence-enabled dynamic capability positively affects the two countries' data-driven culture and environmental performance. Contrary to our expectations, we found the effect of data-driven culture on environmental performance to be not significantly different from zero for the USA sample. Moreover, while the data-driven culture for the French sample partially mediates the relationship between artificial intelligence-enabled dynamic capability and environmental performance, only a direct link between artificial intelligence-enabled dynamic capability and environmental performance could be verified for the USA Case. Our study advances the emerging literature on artificial intelligence-enabled dynamic capability, bringing originality by showing that in an artificial intelligence-enabled dynamic capability context, data-driven can vary according to both the country's national culture hosting the firms/supply chains and the dynamics and changes of such environment.

The model is used for failure prediction, and is able to dynamically adapt to changes in the operating and environmental conditions of assets. The model is implemented for a thermal solar power plant, focusing on critical elements of these plants: Heat transfer fluid pumps. We affirm that this type of model can be easily automated within the plant's remote monitoring system. Using this model we can dynamically assign reference values for warnings and alarms and provide predictions of asset degradation.

"The business goal of interpreting seismic data has always been addressed by the high-level experts engaged. The authors applied a computer vision approach to interpret seismic data. The expert task of interpreting seismic data has become partially automated via machine learning techniques utilized to classify the images used by the authors. The methods of transformation of seismic traces through spectral decomposition were used to obtain the data set. In the previous works of the authors, methods of spectral decomposition via continuous wavelet transformation were created, and this also laid the foundation of this study. Use of artificial neural networks of deep learning has enabled the authors to meet the goal of image classification. In this regard, it is important to note that the business policy related to information dissemination imposed certain limitations on the computing capacity used and the number of the data labeled. The solution found for the use of trained artificial neural networks and image augmentation helped us to successfully cope with the goal, in spite of the limitations. The results obtained allow us to identify geological units with a test accuracy of 90% rendering to the F1-score measure.

"The competitive environment in the global market makes most countries look for better ways to solve their problems. Food waste is the largest concern facing the food security of the world. Not paying attention to process of pomegranate wastes, such as separating the peel from the other parts and ignoring the cost of using artificial intelligence for pest control in gardens and the cost of maintaining the processed products are the gaps of previous researches. To cope with this challenge, recent studies have presented sustainable closed-loop supply chains (SCLSCs) as a strategic approach and a competitive advantage. The present study distinguishes itself from other studies by using the artificial intelligence technology in a supply chain along with the reverse logistics section, i.e., waste recycling. This paper proposes a design for a CLSC pomegranates. The corresponding logistics network is designed for several periods and covers manufacturers, distribution centers, customers, factories, recycling centers (compost centers), and compost end user (compost markets). Using reverse logistics, the wasted pomegranates are also converted into recycled products including ethanol, as an automotive fuel and a renewable energy, and a type of compost processed as an organic fertilizer.

"Maritime transportation is one of the essential drivers of the global economy as it enables both lower transportation costs and intermodal operations across multiple forms of transportation. Maritime ports are essential interfaces that support cargo handling between sea and hinterland transportation. Besides, in this area, environmental protection is becoming extremely important. Global warming, air pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions are all having a detrimental influence on the environment and will most likely continue to do so for future generations. Hence, there is a growing need to promote environmental sustainability in maritime-based transportation. The application of machine learning (ML), as one of the main subdomains of artificial intelligence (AI), can be considered a component within the process of digital transformation to advance green activities in maritime port logistics. Thus, this article presents the results of a systematic literature review of the recent literature on machine learning for promoting environmentally sustainable maritime ports.

"BSTRACT. Demand forecasting is one of the biggest challenges of post-pandemic logistics. It appears that logistics management based on demand prediction can be a suitable alternative to the just-in-time concept. This study aims to identify the effectiveness of AI-based and statistical forecasting models versus practice-based models for SMEs and large enterprises in practice. The study compares the effectiveness of the practice-based Prophet model with the statistical forecasting models, models based on artificial intelligence, and hybrid models developed in the academic environment. Since most of the hybrid models, and the ones based on artificial intelligence, were developed within the last ten years, the study also answers the question of whether the new models have better accuracy than the older ones. The models are evaluated using a multicriteria approach with different weight settings for SMEs and large enterprises. The results show that the Prophet model has higher accuracy than the other models on most time series. At the same time, the Prophet model is slightly less computationally demanding than hybrid models and models based on artificial neural networks. On the other hand, the results of the multicriteria evaluation show that while statistical methods are more suitable for SMEs, the prophet forecasting method is very effective in the case of large enterprises with sufficient computing power and trained predictive analysts. © 2022, Centre of Sociological Research.

"Conversion of oil palm mesocarp fibers (MF) into fermentable sugar through catalytic pretreatment coupled with enzymatic hydrolysis is a promising solution for biomass valorization. However, lack of understanding of the complicated conversion process and optimization of critical reaction conditions limits the efficacy of the sugar production (SP). In this study, we aim to develop an online framework incorporating orthogonal experimental design and machine learning (ML) algorithm to optimize important conditions and identify their interaction impacts on overall sugar yield from MF. The results show that both solid reduction (SR) and sugar conversion (SC) increase to 73.85% and 51.91% from ML-based optimization with relative errors of 20.58%±0.70% and 7.50%±3.68% from experimental validation, respectively, after two rounds of online learning. Model-based interpretation suggests that substrate and catalyst concentrations are two negatively related conditions with both SR and SC, while the solid concentration has a piecewise linear folded relationship.

"Research background:The climate crisis is one of the greatest challenges the world is facing in the 21st century. The global response to this problem must comprise transitions in land and ecosystems, energy, urban, infrastructure, and industrial systems and a transformation in enterprise and risk management. With the global pressure to fight climate change and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, the innovative potential of Industry 4.0 technologies (blockchain, Big Data analytics, the Internet of Things, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, 3D additive manufacturing and technology platforms) has been subject to enormous interest among researchers and practitioners. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated technology investment and digital transformation in many business areas, potentially including sustainability risk management. Purpose of the article: The purpose of this paper is to explore the scope of Industry 4.0 technology implementation in sustainability risk management and its financial impact. Methods: Based on the survey research, the authors verified if enterprises implementing Industry 4.0 technologies during the last five years are benefiting from their investment depending on the number of technologies. Due to the ordinal measurement scale of the analyzed variables, the verification of hypotheses was carried out using the Mann-Whitney U test. Findings & value added: In the opinion of the managers surveyed, the number of Industry 4.0 technologies implemented in the sustainability risk management process does not affect the enterprise’s aggregate Financial Performance Indicator, individual financial indicators (ROA, ROE, OPM, NPM and FLR) and the enterprise’s ability to manage financial risk. This study contributes to the literature on the technological transformation of the sustainability risk management process and its financial importance.

"In a circular economy, recovering materials from end of life (EoL) products without an appropriate estimation of the cost and revenue may result in unnecessary economic loss. Although research has been carried out on the economic analysis of value recovery from EoL products, few quantitative approaches have examined generalized revenue-cost models. To fill this gap, this study proposes an empirical model to identify economic feasibility of product recycling by integrating machine learning and the Sherwood principle. A boundary that differentiates profitable and non-profitable EoL products for material recycling is quantified and visualized. It is envisioned that the proposed method can be adopted in other circular economy domains for better decision-making. © 2020",0,10.1016/j.resconrec.2020.105232,"This study proposes an empirical model that integrates machine learning with the Sherwood principle to assess the economic feasibility of recycling end-of-life products, focusing on quantifying the boundary between profitable and non-profitable recycling efforts.

"Joint cost management is a decisive factor for sustainable collaboration in supplier-buyer dyads. For both parties the establishment of an accurate cost estimation (CE) framework supports managing suppliers' costs as well as manufacturer's quotation costing. Grounded on resource dependence theory and following a design science research approach, this study introduces a multi-perspective CE system inspired by statistical learning, deep learning, decision making, and multi-agent theory. We evaluate our system by a single case and computer simulation study, using empirical data coming from observations and archives at a large Bavarian original equipment manufacturer (OEM). The results indicate that our CE approach allows to select the most significant cost-drivers and predict total costs of parts and assemblies with high accuracy. This supports the supplier in efficiently managing its costs. In making the CE blackbox model transparent using a combination of model agnostic post-hoc explainable artificial intelligence approaches we foster user acceptance for both suppliers and OEMs. All CE artifacts are ensembled in a multi-agent system to automatically manage costs with suppliers and furthermore, as a model extension, can lead to a collaborative price agreement.

"Due to expected positive impacts on business, the application of artificial intelligence has been widely increased. The decision-making procedures of those models are often complex and not easily understandable to the company’s stakeholders, i.e. the people having to follow up on recommendations or try to understand automated decisions of a system. This opaqueness and black-box nature might hinder adoption, as users struggle to make sense and trust the predictions of AI models. Recent research on eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) focused mainly on explaining the models to AI experts with the purpose of debugging and improving the performance of the models. In this article, we explore how such systems could be made explainable to the stakeholders. For doing so, we propose a new convolutional neural network (CNN)-based explainable predictive model for product backorder prediction in inventory management. Backorders are orders that customers place for products that are currently not in stock. The company now takes the risk to produce or acquire the backordered products while in the meantime, customers can cancel their orders if that takes too long, leaving the company with unsold items in their inventory. Hence, for their strategic inventory management, companies need to make decisions based on assumptions. Our argument is that these tasks can be improved by offering explanations for AI recommendations. Hence, our research investigates how such explanations could be provided, employing Shapley additive explanations to explain the overall models’ priority in decision-making. Besides that, we introduce locally interpretable surrogate models that can explain any individual prediction of a model. The experimental results demonstrate effectiveness in predicting backorders in terms of standard evaluation metrics and outperform known related works with AUC 0.9489. Our approach demonstrates how current limitations of predictive technologies can be addressed in the business domain. © 2022, The Author(s).",0,10.1007/s12525-022-00599-z,"This paper explores the development of an explainable AI model using convolutional neural networks for predicting product backorders in inventory management, addressing the challenge of model interpretability for stakeholders.

"Sustainable consumption and production is a critical issue in the chemical industry due to increasing public concerns on environmental and safety issues. Organizations are urged to improve the quality of chemical products while minimizing the environmental impacts during production. In current practice, chemists and formulators have to determine both the ingredients to be used and the machine parameter settings during product development and production. Without appropriate operations strategies for managing sustainable consumption and production, a significant portion of the ingredients, toxic materials and pollutants are wasted or emitted during the trial-and-error processes when developing chemical products. In addition, inappropriate machine parameter settings, such as blending speed and blending temperature, result in inefficient energy use. Motivated by these issues, this paper describes a recursive operations strategy (ROS) model for achieving sustainable consumption and production in the chemical industry. The ROS model first identifies the business strategy, and then defines operations strategies by assessing the competitive priorities and policies with the use of artificial intelligence, including case-based reasoning and fuzzy logic, so as to manage the operations functions. The effectiveness of the model is verified by means of a case study. The results indicate that the model can provide direct guidelines for the users to develop products based on previously developed products. By so doing, the number of trials for testing various ingredient formulae can be reduced, minimizing the ingredient waste. The proposed model is also capable of achieving continuous improvement and determining the optimal production process conditions for avoiding unnecessary energy consumption. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",0,10.1016/j.ijpe.2016.07.011,This paper presents a recursive operations strategy (ROS) model that utilizes artificial intelligence to enhance sustainable consumption and production in the chemical industry by optimizing ingredient selection and machine parameters.

"Digital twin (DT), machine learning, and industrial Internet of things (IIoT) provide great potential for the transformation of the container terminal from automation to intelligence. The production control in the loading and unloading process of automated container terminals (ACTs) involves complex situations, which puts forward high requirements for efficiency and safety. To realize the real-time optimization and security of the ACT, a framework integrating DT with the AdaBoost algorithm is proposed in this study. The framework is mainly composed of physical space, a data service platform, and virtual space, in which the twin space and service system constitute virtual space. In the proposed framework, a multidimensional and multiscale DT model in twin space is first built through a 3D MAX and U3D technology. Second, we introduce a random forest and XGBoost to compare with AdaBoost to select the best algorithm to train and optimize the DT mechanism model. Third, the experimental results show that the AdaBoost algorithm is better than others by comparing the performance indexes of model accuracy, root mean square error, interpretable variance, and fitting error. In addition, we implement empirical experiments by different scales to further evaluate the proposed framework. The experimental results show that the mode of the DT-based terminal operation has higher loading and unloading efficiency than that of the conventional terminal operation, increasing by 23.34% and 31.46% in small-scale and large-scale problems, respectively.

"Production planning and scheduling optimisation for underground mining operations has continued to attract significant attention over the last decades. This has been necessitated by the growing need for operations to meet their shareholder's expectations sustainably under increasingly challenging operational dynamics. Several studies have been undertaken to utilise mathematical programming models such as mixed-integer programming, heuristics and simulation algorithms including combinations of these techniques for production scheduling optimisation with some notable achievements noted in extant literature. However, the limited reach of standalone mathematical optimisation models under increasing volumes of input data spurred by the booming information technology (IT) platforms has become more apparent and pertinent for increased scholarly attention. The growing emergence of big data, driven by the industrial digitisation and automation has seen an increased appetite for data-driven optimisation planning and scheduling largely in manufacturing and operations management. However, the scarcity of discussion in this novel and fast-evolving area in the underground mining space presents a glaring blind spot that appeals for thoughtful conversations to narrow that gap.

"With the increase in waste streams, industrial sorting has become a major issue. The main challenge is to minimise sorting errors to avoid serious recycling problems and significant quality degradation of the final recycled product. Making use of near infrared (NIR) technology, some industrialists have already designed sorting machines able to discriminate between several types of plastics with good reliability. However, these devices are not suited to dark plastics, which are very common in WEEE (Waste Electronic and Electrical Equipment). In order to overcome this obstacle, mid-wavelength infrared (MIR) technology can be used instead of NIR. Nevertheless, the new spectral range is poorer in terms of wavelength for some plastics of interest (2712−5274nm), which makes the sorting task harder in an industrial context where spectrum identification is subject to imprecision and uncertainty. This article shows the benefit of combining this promising optical technology with a cautious machine learning procedure to optimise recycling. When the information provided by the device regarding a plastic fragment to be sorted is insufficient to discriminate between candidate materials, the proposed procedure, taking advantage of the belief functions theory, blows the fragment into a container dedicated to more than one specific material. This cautious sorting enables the containers dedicated to the specific materials to contain less impurities, which leads to higher-quality secondary raw materials. The proposed sorting procedure is illustrated and compared with a more conventional approach using real industrial data. © 2020",0,10.1016/j.resconrec.2020.105258,"This paper addresses the challenge of industrial sorting of plastics, particularly dark plastics in WEEE, by combining mid-wavelength infrared technology with a machine learning procedure to optimize recycling processes.

"This article examines the theoretical and practical implications of artificial intelligence (AI) integration in supply chain management (SCM). AI has developed dramatically in recent years, embodied by the newest generation of large language models (LLMs) that exhibit human-like capabilities in various domains. However, SCM as a discipline seems unprepared for this potential revolution, as existing perspectives do not capture the potential for disruption offered by AI tools. Moreover, AI integration in SCM is not only a technical but also a social process, influenced by human sensemaking and interpretation of AI systems. This article offers a novel theoretical lens called the AI Integration (AII) framework, which considers two key dimensions: the level of AI integration across the supply chain and the role of AI in decision-making. It also incorporates human meaning-making as an overlaying factor that shapes AI integration and disruption dynamics. The article demonstrates that different ways of integrating AI will lead to different kinds of disruptions, both in theory and in practice. It also discusses the implications of AI integration for SCM theorizing and practice, highlighting the need for cross-disciplinary collaboration and sociotechnical perspectives. © 2023 The Author.

"Food waste is a significant problem within public catering establishments in any normal situation. During spring 2020 the Covid-19 pandemic placed the public catering system under greater pressure, revealing weaknesses within the system and generation of food waste due to rapidly changing consumption patterns. In times of crisis, it is especially important to conserve resources and allocate existing resources to areas where they can be of most use, but this poses significant challenges. This study evaluated the potential of a forecasting model to predict guest attendance during the start and throughout the pandemic. This was done by collecting data on guest attendance in Swedish school and preschool catering establishments before and during the pandemic, and using a machine learning approach to predict future guest attendance based on historical data. Comparison of various learning methods revealed that random forest produced more accurate forecasts than a simple artificial neural network, with conditional mean absolute prediction error of <0.15 for the trained dataset. Economic savings were obtained by forecasting compared with a no-plan scenario, supporting selection of the random forest approach for effective forecasting of meal planning. Overall, the results obtained using forecasting models for meal planning in times of crisis confirmed their usefulness. Continuous use can improve estimates for the test period, due to the agile and flexible nature of these models. This is particularly important when guest attendance is unpredictable, so that production planning can be optimized to reduce food waste and contribute to a more sustainable and resilient food system. © 2021 The Author(s)",0,10.1016/j.seps.2021.101041,"This study evaluates a machine learning forecasting model to predict guest attendance in public catering establishments during the Covid-19 pandemic, aiming to optimize meal planning and reduce food waste.

"A large variety of models have been developed in the last two decades aiming at supply chain (SC) stress-testing and resilience. New digital and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies allow to develop novel approaches and tools in this area for the transition from standalone models to intelligent decision-support systems (DSSs). However, the literature lacks concepts and guidelines for the design of such systems. In this paper, we offer a generalized decision-making framework for using digital twins in SC stress-testing and resilience analysis as well as delineate how digital twins can contribute to theory development in SC resilience and viability. We position our proposed approach as an intelligent digital twin (iDT) – a human–AI system which visualizes physical SCs in digital form, collects and processes data for modelling using analytics methods, mimics human decision-making rules, and creates new knowledge and decision-making algorithms through human–AI collaboration. We conclude that the iDT supports monitoring, disruption prediction (early signals), event-driven responses, learning, and proactive thinking, integrating proactive and reactive approaches to SC resilience. The iDT helps to make the unknown known and so contributes to the development of a proactive, adaptation-based view on SC resilience and viability.

"The growing environmental business uncertainties have forced companies to focus on developing more flexible supply chains. Digital transformation has been considered a key means to achieving such flexibility, but the literature lacks empirical evidence about how digital technologies effectively contribute to it. Thus, this study aims to analyze how Smart Supply Chain (i.e., a supply chain enabled by digital transformation) contributes to supply chain flexibility and operational performance in environments surrounded by customer and supplier uncertainty. We adopt the organizational information-processing theory to explain the fit between information needs to reduce these uncertainties through more supply chain flexibility (sourcing, delivery, and manufacturing) and information capabilities provided by three main dimensions of the Smart Supply Chain (digital transformation strategy, digital base technologies, and digital front-end technologies). We relate these information-processing fit between Smart Supply Chain and flexibility with the boundary conditions of environmental uncertainty and operational performance improvements. Such relationships are analyzed through moderation and mediation regression tests based on 379 manufacturing companies surveyed. Our findings show that Smart Supply Chain has a statistical association with operational performance through the sequential mediating role of the three supply chain flexibility dimensions. We also found that environments with high customer uncertainty increase the use of base technologies (IoT, cloud, big data, AI, and blockchain) to reach delivery flexibility and support manufacturing flexibility. When companies face high supplier uncertainty, they use front-end technologies (i.e., robotics, 3D printing, simulation, and augmented reality) to increase sourcing flexibility.

"Alongside many studies on greening efforts for supply chain activities, there is a research gap in understanding the emergence and adoption of green supply chain innovation (GSCI) in this digital-enabled Industry 4.0 era. This study defines GSCI as innovation practices by manufacturers that apply emergent digital technologies to integrate environmental concerns into supply chain management activities. GSCI is evolving as a new paradigm of green supply chain management (GSCM) to elevate its five underlying implementation dimensions. Manufacturing enterprises can benefit from digital technology applications to enhance efficiency of environmental outcomes of their GSCM activities, including internal environmental management, green purchasing, customer cooperation, inventory recovery, and eco-design. The GSCI concept gains growing attention in research and practice with popular digital technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, cloud computing, and big data analytics increasingly adopted by manufacturers to improve their GSCM. So far, the literature lacks studies on GSCI to examine the concept, investigate the practices, explain the adoption motivations, consolidate and extend the knowledge on its adoption and diffusion.

"This study attempts to understand the role of artificial intelligence-driven big data analytics capability in humanitarian relief operations. These disasters play an important role in mobilizing several organizations to counteract them, but the organizations often find it hard to strike a fine balance between agility and resilience. Operations Management Scholars’ opinion remains divided between responsiveness and efficiency. However, to manage unexpected events like disasters, organizations need to be agile and resilient. In previous studies, scholars have adopted the resource-based view or dynamic capability view to explain the combination of resources and capabilities (i.e., technology, agility, and resilience) to explain their performance. However, following some recent scholarly debates, we argue that organizational theories like the resource-based view or dynamic capability view are not suitable enough to explain humanitarian supply chain performance. As the underlying assumptions of the commercial supply chain do not hold true in the case of the humanitarian supply chain. We note this as a potential research gap in the existing literature. Moreover, humanitarian organizations remain sceptical regarding the adoption of artificial intelligence-driven big data analytics capability (AI-BDAC) in the decision-making process. To address these potential gaps, we grounded our theoretical model in the practice-based view which is proposed as an appropriate lens to examine the role of practices that are not rare and are easy to imitate in performance. We used Partial Least Squares (PLS) to test our theoretical model and research hypotheses, using 171 useable responses gathered through a web survey of international non-governmental organizations (NGOs). The findings of our study suggest that AI-BDAC is a significant determinant of agility, resilience, and performance of the humanitarian supply chain. Furthermore, the reduction of the level of information complexity (IC) on the paths joining agility, resilience, and performance in the humanitarian supply chain. These results offer some useful theoretical contributions to the contingent view of the practice-based view. In a way, we have tried to establish empirically that the humanitarian supply chain designs are quite different from their commercial counterparts. Hence, the use of a resource-based view or dynamic capability view as theoretical lenses may not help capture true perspectives. Thus, the use of a practice-based view as an alternative theoretical lens provides a better understanding of humanitarian supply chains.

"Businesses are rapidly incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) into operations, particularly to manage regret bias. Based on a game with three financing options (bank financing, guarantee financing and direct financing), we investigate how AI influences financing preferences among e-commerce supply chain participants, which involve one capital-constrained and regretful SME, one e-commerce platform, and a bank. Firstly, our findings reveal that the impact of AI is not a clear-cut matter. AI may not consistently boost platform profitability under guarantee financing, platform needs to consider the production scale effect brought by AI against the potential default risk. Similarly, in direct financing, SME must strike a balance between the increase in output resulting from AI development and the potential impact of platform adjusting interest rates. Secondly, from the perspective of financing strategy space, it's evident that AI can be a positive force in encouraging all supply chain participants to enjoy platform financing services. Specifically, SME prefers direct financing over guarantor financing when the unit regret bias cost and production cost is low but the commission fee is high. Platform is more inclined to provide direct financing if unit production cost is low and unit commission fee is high. Otherwise, bank financing is preferred. As regret bias cost diminish, the strategy space for bank financing contracts. For the whole supply chain, all three types of financing may be options. Guarantee and direct financing gradually become more popular as SME uses AI at higher levels. Moreover, conclusions remain robust when SME is fully credit-constrained or platform is fully financially constrained. These results not only underscore the critical role of AI in regret bias and financial management but also shed light on the innovative possibilities in financing within the e-commerce supply chain. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",0,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103649,"This paper examines how AI influences financing preferences among participants in an e-commerce supply chain, particularly in managing regret bias.

"Civil engineering design problems are inherently complex, characterized by iterative processes, multiple criteria, and time-consuming manual design work. Traditional methods often struggle to rapidly reach optimal designs, lacking guarantees of achieving optimality. With the advent of recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), this study attempts to answer the research question: How AI algorithms can expedite the civil engineering design process, enhancing efficiency and accuracy in reaching optimal solutions with fewer resources. The research employs a Markov decision process-based AI framework, integrating configuration design and refinement in a unified approach. The methodology begins with the Markov decision-making process to mathematically model the design process, followed by reinforcement learning for automatic design and refinement of solutions. Applied to a planar truss bridge design problem, the AI design agent produced feasible truss designs under various constraints efficiently, demonstrating superior capability and flexibility. The results indicate an average improvement of 12% in accuracy and 88% in computational efficiency over traditional methods.

"Integrated project delivery (IPD) has gained traction as a collaborative approach to managing complexity and uncertainty in large industrial capital projects. While IPD emphasizes team integration and process alignment to drive better outcomes, the lack of standardized benchmarks to evaluate its performance relative to traditional methods persists as a barrier. To bridge this gap, this study developed a practical, and unbiased Project Success Framework (PSF) for IPD on industrial projects. A mixed methods research approach including subject matter experts’ survey, research charrette, and validation survey was conducted to build and validate the PSF. In addition, this study proposed a machine learning (ML)-based application tool embedding PSF to enhance the practicality and applicability of PSF. The machine learning-based application tool was validated by comparing the results with the PSF suggested in this research. The PSF developed in this study allows researchers and practitioners to empirically evaluate the integrated project delivery’s efficacy on key industrial project outcomes. In addition, it offers a method to compare project delivery methods across diverse projects, aiding organizations in precise selection using empirical evidence for optimal results.

"Intrusion behavior in hazardous areas is one of the major causes of construction safety accidents including falls from height and strikes by objects. Implementing automatic and preassessment of intrusions to enhance safety performance is of great importance in construction areas. Traditional behavioral safety management mainly relies on manual observation, which makes it difficult to accurately identify detailed changes in behavioral posture, while the results of risk analysis are susceptible to bias due to subjective factors. The emergence of artificial intelligence techniques and computer vision has provided new solutions for human behavior detection in recent years. Accurate vision-based skeleton extraction helps capture detailed behavioral information. Current studies generally focus on intrusion after the occurrence and rarely select metrics considering complex human motion features. It is difficult to accurately assess the potential intrusion risk, resulting in inefficient ex-ante safety management outcomes. This paper presents a novel intrusion assessment approach by integrating human kinematics to extract risk indicators and apply objective assessment methods for risk quantification. An indoor experiment with control groups was conducted by employing skeleton detection technology with safety knowledge to demonstrate its feasibility and effectiveness. The risk levels of the different activities were compared through a control group experimental analysis. The results show that a satisfying accuracy of intrusion assessment can be achieved for different workers. Appropriate warning and intervention methods can be implemented to mitigate the occurrence or reduce the severity of intrusions, thus reducing safety incidents on construction sites. © 2024 American Society of Civil Engineers.",0,10.1061/JCEMD4.COENG-13638,This paper proposes a novel approach for assessing intrusion risks in construction sites by integrating human kinematics and computer vision techniques to enhance safety management.

"Worker safety and productivity and the factors that affect them, such as ergonomics, are essential aspects of construction projects. The application of ergonomics and the identification of the connections between workers and assigned tasks have led to a decrease in worker injuries and discomfort, beneficial effects on productivity, and a reduction in project costs. Nevertheless, workers in the construction area are often subjected to awkward body postures and repetitive motions that cause musculoskeletal disorders, in turn leading to delays in production. As a systematic and widely used procedure that generates a final document or form, physical demand analysis (PDA) assesses the health and safety of workers engaged in construction or manufacturing activities and proactively evaluates ergonomic risks. However, to gather the necessary information, traditional PDA methods require ergonomists to spend significant time observing and interviewing workers. To increase the speed and accuracy of PDA, this study focuses on developing a systematic PDA framework to automatically fill a posture-based PDA form and address the physiological aspects of task demands. In contrast to the traditional observation-based approach, the proposed framework uses a motion capture (MOCAP) system and a rule-based expert system to obtain joint angles and body segment positions in different work situations, convert the measurements to objective identification of activities and their frequencies, and then automatically populate the PDA forms. The framework is tested and validated in both laboratory and on-site environments by comparing the generated forms with PDA forms filled out by ergonomists. The results indicate that the MOCAP-/AI-based automated PDA framework successfully improves the performance of PDA in terms of accuracy, consistency, and time consumption. Ultimately, this framework can aid in the design of job tasks and work environments with the goal of promoting health, safety, and productivity in the workplace. © 2024 American Society of Civil Engineers.",0,10.1061/JCEMD4.COENG-13811,This study develops an automated framework for physical demand analysis (PDA) using motion capture and AI to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of assessing worker safety and productivity in construction.

"Purpose: There is a growing body of conceptual work considering the potential of AI in supply chain and procurement, and there is great interest in AI among managers. But, according to a recent study, digital strategies for procurement are often missing or not satisfactory. Literature offers conflicting guidance on possible adoption areas for AI in core procurement processes. Given the need for better digital strategies for procurement and the need to further develop the understanding of adoption potential, the purpose of this paper is to explore actual adoption levels, experienced benefits, readiness levels and barriers to implementation in industry. This informs nuanced, not hyped, managerial consideration and identifies further research opportunities. Design/methodology/approach: Leveraging items used in literature to study adoption of other technologies, the authors conduct the first empirical exploration of actual adoption levels of AI in procurement. The authors do so by collecting survey responses in three manager workshops, and the authors use the workshops to seek manager input in the interpretation of findings and the identification of implications for managers and researchers. Findings: There appears to be less consideration given to AI in procurement than interest in the topic might imply. Adoption levels are generally low, implying that there is a lot of room for the development of consideration, use cases and possible pilots by managers and researchers. The authors find procurement benefits of AI adoption to be broader than costs and productivity alone, including visibility and innovation. But, readiness appears to be at relatively low levels with factors commonly considered in literature, such as executive support and willingness to invest, less relevant than less widely considered elements such as human sense making and supplier readiness.

"The ongoing revolution in industrial production- Industry 4.0, is driven by transformative technologies such as the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), single-board computers, and 5G communication. As the trend towards IIoT continues, an increasing number of industrial drive systems and their fleets are being connected to the cloud. This enables the manufacturers to perform condition monitoring (CM) and streamlined maintenance activities. At the heart of these drive systems are Power Electronics Systems (PESs), which operate at high switching frequencies (10 kHz–1 MHz) to efficiently transfer electrical power and deliver it to a load in a controlled manner. However, due to their functionalities and the presence of semiconductor switches, PESs are susceptible to failure, necessitating effective condition monitoring (CM) for fault detection and improved lifetime. Link to this issue, to enable CM based on high-frequency data, an industrial site with multiple electric drives is required to record data up to 15TB/week. Therefore, there is a demand from industrial partners to establish intelligent communication between a fleet of physical systems and the cloud to reduce transmission, storage, and bandwidth costs, as well as to enable real-time fault detection and learning from fleet operations. This paper proposes an intelligent edge–cloud computing methodology to address the challenge of high-frequency data monitoring for PESs, focusing on novelty detection and selective data transmission to reduce transmission costs. The methodology involves developing a novel edge–cloud framework that incorporates a neural network-based novelty detector for selective data transmission from physical systems to the cloud. The proposed methodology is evaluated through hardware tests, demonstrating a significant reduction in data transmission (94%) and potential cost savings of up to €5.9k/year for a single remote system. 95.6% detection accuracy of the PQ phase is obtained during experimental tests over 590 samples. Thus, this paper contributes to the vision of the smart grid and IIoT by analyzing the Power Quality (PQ) monitoring problem of a three-phase grid and showcasing the capability of the proposed framework in terms of novelty detection and data transmission cost reduction. To conclude, the proposed intelligent edge–cloud computing methodology offers a promising solution for effective condition monitoring of PESs, with potential cost savings and improved fault detection capabilities.

"Machine learning can be effectively used to generate models capable of representing the dynamic of production processes of small and medium-sized enterprises. These models enable the estimation of key performance indicators, and are often used for optimizing production processes. However, in most industrial applications, modeling and optimization of production processes are currently carried out as separate tasks, manually in a very costly and inefficient way. Automated machine learning tools and frameworks facilitate the path for deriving models, reducing modeling time and cost. However, optimization by exploiting production models is still in infancy. This work presents a methodology for integrating a fully automated procedure that embraces automated machine learning pipelines and a multi-objective optimization algorithm for improving the production processes, with special focus on small and medium-sized enterprises. This procedure is supported on embedding the generated models as objective functions of a reference point based non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm, resulting in preference-based Pareto-optimal parametrizations of the corresponding production processes. The methodology was implemented and validated using data from a manufacturing production process of a small manufacturing enterprise, generating highly accurate machine learning-based models for the analyzed indicators.

"Pre-programmed welding robots significantly improved the efficiency and quality of the welds in large batch production. In small and medium batch production, the robots need appropriate sensors to perform well and adapt to the changes and uncertainties in a noisy welding environment. Vision-based sensors enabled by machine learning are making it possible to sense in process previously not measurable. One challenge is developing artificial intelligent models capable of real-time seam tracking, particularly in fillet joints where visual analysis is hindered by non-perpendicular camera angles and arc reflections. In this paper, we propose a vision system that enables automated seam tracking with a collaborative robot. The vision-based deep learning classification model detects the tacks, where the seam is not visible. It is based on a keypoint detection deep learning model that addresses the challenges in distorted and noisy images of fillet joints between the pipes and flanges during the real-time Gas Metal Arc Welding to track the location of the seam in non tack images. The system is optimized for real time seam tracking by proposing the appropriate input image size. Multiple images and multiple points are also considered to provide a controllable signal of the location of the seam with less errors and outliers. Our proposed model can track the seam with more than 80 percent accuracy for errors less than 0.3 mm in fillet joints. The high accuracy of the proposed method would result in fewer flaws and defects and reduced rework, resulting in significant cost saving in manufacturing.

"This research investigates growth inhibitors for smart services driven by condition-based maintenance (CBM). Despite the fast rise of Industry 4.0 technologies, such as smart sensoring, internet of things, and machine learning (ML), smart services have failed to keep pace. Combined, these technologies enable CBM to achieve the lean goal of high reliability and low waste for industrial equipment. Equipment located at customers throughout the world can be monitored and maintained by manufacturers and service providers, but so far industry uptake has been slow. The contributions of this study are twofold. First, it uncovers industry settings that impede the use of equipment failure data needed to train ML algorithms to predict failures and use these predictions to trigger maintenance. These empirical settings, drawn from four global machine equipment manufacturers, include either under- or over-maintenance (i.e., either too much or too little periodic maintenance). Second, formal analysis of a system dynamics model based on these empirical settings reveals a sweet spot of industry settings in which such inhibitors are absent.

"Purpose: The objective of this paper is to develop a condition-based maintenance (CBM) scheme for pneumatic cylinders. The CBM scheme will detect two common types of air leaking failure modes and identify the leaky/faulty cylinder. The successful implementation of the proposed scheme will reduce energy consumption, scrap and rework, and time to repair. Design/methodology/approach: Effective implementation of maintenance is important to reduce operation cost, improve productivity and enhance quality performance at the same time. Condition-based monitoring is an effective maintenance scheme where maintenance is triggered based on the condition of the equipment monitored either real time or at certain intervals. Pneumatic air systems are commonly used in many industries for packaging, sorting and powering air tools among others. A common failure mode of pneumatic cylinders is air leaks which is difficult to detect for complex systems with many connections. The proposed method consists of monitoring the stroke speed profile of the piston inside the pneumatic cylinder using hall effect sensors. Statistical features are extracted from the speed profiles and used to develop a fault detection machine learning model. The proposed method is demonstrated using a real-life case of tea packaging machines. Findings: Based on the limited data collected, the ensemble machine learning algorithm resulted in 88.4% accuracy. The algorithm can detect failures as soon as they occur based on majority vote rule of three machine learning models. Practical implications: Early air leak detection will improve quality of packaged tea bags and provide annual savings due to time to repair and energy waste reduction.

"This paper presents a novel approach to the strategic planning of the supply chain for lime cultivation. The uncertainty associated with lime production due to factors such as transportation, crime, and water availability, among others, represents different challenges. To address these challenges, the authors propose the use of machine learning tools coupled with deterministic optimization to obtain optimal solutions for the supply chain for future years. This paper highlights the use of justice schemes to ensure an equitable distribution of lime production between farmers and learning machines to quantify the insecurity impact on lime production in Michoacan. The problem can be solved using a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model that focuses on maximizing economic benefits, minimizing the use of irrigation water in crops, and minimizing Carbon Dioxide Equivalent (CO2eq) emissions within the supply chain.

"Food waste is responsible for severe environmental, social, and economic issues and therefore it is imperative to prevent or at least minimize its generation. The main cause of food waste is poor demand forecasting and so it is essential to improve the accuracy of the tools tasked with these forecasts. The present work proposes four models meant to help food catering services predict food demand accurately and thus avoid overproducing or underproducing. Each model is based on a different machine learning technique. Two baseline models are also proposed to mimic how food catering services estimate future demand and to infer the added value of employing machine learning in this context. To verify the impact of the proposed models, they were tested on data from the three different canteens chosen as case studies. The results show that the models based on the random forest algorithm and the long short-term memory neural network produced the best forecasts, which would lead to a 14% to 52% reduction in the number of wasted meals. Furthermore, by basing their decisions on these forecasts, the food catering services would be able to reduce unmet demand by 3% to 16% when compared with the forecasts of the baseline models. Thus, employing machine learning to forecast future demand can be very beneficial to food catering services. These forecasts can increase the service level of food services and reduce food waste, mitigating its environmental, social, and economic consequences. © 2023 The Author(s)",0,10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.140265,"This paper proposes four machine learning models to improve demand forecasting for food catering services, aiming to reduce food waste by enhancing prediction accuracy.

"Amidst recent supply chain disruptions triggered by pandemics and crises, the imperative of bolstering supply chain security and resilience is escalating. Central to this endeavor is the augmentation of risk-taking capabilities among enterprises at supply chain nodes. Rapid advances in artificial intelligence (AI), coupled with the burgeoning concentration within supply chains present promising avenues for enhancing corporate risk-taking capacity (CRTC). However, a conspicuous gap exists in the relationship between enterprise AI transformation, supply chain concentration, and CRTC. This study constructs a panel simultaneous equation model to contrast the direct impact of corporate AI transformation on CRTC with its indirect influence, facilitated by the reduction of supply chain concentration (Scii). The results indicate that the overall effect of corporate AI transformation on CRTC is positive. In the indirect path, an increase in supply chain concentration effectively enhances CRTC, and firms exhibiting higher CRTC also show a preference for supply chains with centralized configurations. All of these interactions involve heterogeneity in property rights and firm life cycle stages. This study broadens the understanding of factors influencing CRTC at the supply chain level and sheds light on the policy implications of enterprise AI transformation.

"Demand forecasting plays a pivotal role in modern Supply Chain Management (SCM). It is an essential part of inventory planning and management and can be challenging at times. One of the major issues being faced in demand forecasting is insufficient forecast accuracy to predict the expected demand and fluctuation in actual vs. the predicted demand results in fore-casting errors. This problem is further exaggerated with slow-moving and intermittent demand items. Every organization encounters large proportions of items that have small ir-regular demand with long periods of zero demand, which are known as intermittent demand Items. Demand for such items occur sporadically and with considerable fluctuation in the size of the demand. Forecasting of the intermittent demand entails the prediction of demand series that is characterized by the time interval between demand being significantly greater than the unit forecast period. Because of this there are multiple periods of no demand in the intermittent demand time series. The challenge with these products with low irregular demand is that these items need to be stocked and replenished at regular interval irrespective of the demand cycle, thus adding to the cost of holding the inventory. Since the demand is not continuous, Traditional Forecasting models are unable to provide reliable estimate of required inventory level and replenishment point. Forecast errors would resulting in obsolescent stock or unfulfilled demand. The current paper presents a simple yet powerful approach for generating a demand forecasting and replenishment process for such low volume intermittent demand items to come up with a recommendation for dynamic re-order point, thus, improving the inventory performance of these items. Currently, the demand forecast is generally based on past usage patterns. The rise of Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) has provided a strong alternative to solve the problem of forecasting Intermittent Demand. The intention is to highlight that machine learning algorithm is more efficient and accurate than traditional forecasting method. As we move forward to industry 4.0, the digital supply chain is considered as the most essential com-ponent of the value chain wherein the inventory size is controlled, and the demand predicted. © 2024 A.

"Background: The decision-making process in the operational context of enterprises is an integral aspect of how they function, and in this area, precise demand forecasting plays a key role. The use of accurate forecasting models not only meets customer expectations but also enables efficient resource allocation and operational cost optimization. In the long term, such actions contribute to increasing the organization's competitiveness in the market. In recent years, there has been a growing trend in the use of advanced analytical technologies, including machine learning, for demand forecasting purposes. This scientific paper focuses on a comparative analysis of demand forecasting effectiveness using the generative language model GPT in relation to the auto ARIMA algorithm. Methods: A case study analysis for a selected manufacturing organization was conducted based on twelve diversified operational references, for which the supply chain mechanisms are heterogeneous. In the research process, a classification into four reference groups was established, based on the time required to complete the ordering process. Forecast generation was carried out using the auto.arima() algorithm in the R programming environment, as well as through the ChatGPT language model versions 3-5. The forecast results were subjected to comparative analysis, in which weighting was applied for different forecast accuracy indicators, including the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and the number of precisely predicted daily forecasts. Results: The study showed that ChatGPT is more reliable in forecasting compared to ARIMA. However, integrating ChatGPT into the existing systems in the company can be problematic, mainly due to limitations in data operations. Despite this, ChatGPT has the potential to improve the accuracy of inventory management plans both in the short and long term.

However, existing ABC classification methods operate as black-box AI processes that only provide assignments of the items to the different ABC classes without providing further managerial explanations. The multi-criteria nature of the inventory classification problem makes the utilization and the interpretation of item classes difficult, without further information. Decision makers usually need additional information regarding important characteristics that were crucial in determining the managerial classes of the items because such information can help managers better understand the inventory groups and make inventory management decisions more transparent. To address this issue, we propose a two-phased explainable approach based on eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) capabilities. The proposed approach provides both local and global explanations of the built ABC classes at the item and class levels, respectively. Application of the proposed approach in inventory classification of a firm, specialized in retail sales, demonstrated its effectiveness in generating accurate and interpretable ABC classes. Assignments of the items to the different ABC classes were well-explained based on the item’s criteria. The results in this particular application have shown a significant impact of the sales, profit, and customer priority as criteria that had an impact on determining the item classes. © 2023 by the authors.",0,10.3390/jtaer18020044,"This paper proposes an explainable AI approach to enhance the multi-criteria ABC classification model for inventory management, addressing the limitations of existing black-box methods.

"Technological advancements aim to facilitate more optimal supply chain flows. Despite advancements, delays brought by traffic enforcement contact apprehensions disrupt the supply chain's efficiency, thus facilitating implied losses. Although companies cannot control the traffic, the government can optimize traffic flow and enforce traffic laws with minimal disruptions to supply chain delivery agents. A method of optimizing traffic flow while maintaining an uncompromised traffic law enforcement initiative is through an automated no-contact apprehension policy (NCAP). This enforces an AI-based system to detect traffic violations and link them to the license plate information of a motor vehicle. In these systems, an LPR module is essential. This study investigates using a neural network-based LPR architecture for traffic control and management. A MATLAB digital twin simulation is used to model a supply chain flow. The simulation compares and contrasts the supply chain flow in two cases: one where traffic enforcement is conducted in-person, while the other using NCAP. Simulation results suggest that more deliveries can be made when the government enforces an NCAP system. © 2023 IEEE.",0,10.1109/HNICEM60674.2023.10589240,This study examines the use of an AI-based automated no-contact apprehension policy (NCAP) to optimize traffic flow and its impact on supply chain efficiency.

"In last mile delivery, to manage delivery default risks and ensure delivery completion, reserve personenel are placed. This is due to driver procurement having to be planned and executed about one-month ahead, when delivery demands could only be roughly predicted. Although reserve drivers occasionally work as final defense, it regularly lowers driver utility, and a method to place reserve drivers balancing delivery default risk and driver utility is required. Previous work tackled this problem by stochastic staffing problem approaches, but there existed a limit in feature modelling and result interpretability, which created a gap in algorithms and procurement manager decision making. The proposed method aims to fill this gap, by taking a transdisciplinary approach of traditional scheduling, probability modelling, and explainable AI. In doing so, a flow of first creating a staffing schedule based on fixed staffing number demands, and then determining a fixed number of reserve personnel required for each staffing window, was designed. A probablity distribution of required personnel number per delivery is calculated in doing so, and this distribution is used as a easy to understand decision support tool for delivery managers.

Data fusion combines multiple sources of data, such as sensor and business data, to improve machine-based predictions. The framework analyses AI applications, prediction during inspection, and data fusion methods, and addresses challenges in integrating business data into predictions. It demonstrates how data fusion improves prediction quality and stability in inspection. The framework is applied and evaluated in a case study from the automotive sector, showing an increase in good-quality predictions based on sensor data, leading to improved resource efficiency and circularity. This framework can be applied to any sector seeking sustainable manufacturing (SM).  © The Author(s) 2023.",0,10.1504/IJSM.2022.134562,"This paper proposes a framework for enhancing circularity in production through data fusion methods in product inspection, addressing the integration of AI applications into the product life cycle.

"Maintaining accurate inventory records remains a central problem for managing retail operations. Discrepancies between the physical and recorded stock lead to poor reordering decisions and the resulting over or understocking of products, which in turn increases waste and lost sales, respectively. In this study, we revisit this classic inventory management problem by investigating whether novel machine learning algorithms provide an improvement over established practices. Specifically, we explore the application of deep learning as a work routine to identify and correct ‘impactful’ inventory record errors - those that affect future reordering decisions - by leveraging product level, store level, and inventory quality data. © 2022, Academy of Management.

"Using compressed air in industrial processes is often accompanied by a poor cost-benefit ratio and a negative impact on the environmental footprint due to usual distribution inefficiencies. Compressed air-based systems are expensive regarding installation and lead to high running costs due to pricey maintenance requirements and low energy efficiency due to leakage. However, compressed air-based systems are indispensable for various industrial processes, like handling parts with Class A surface requirements such as outer skin sheets in automobile production. Most of those outer skin parts are solely handled by vacuum-based grippers to minimize any visible effect on the finished car. Fulfilling customer expectations and simultaneously reducing the running costs of decisive systems requires finding innovative strategies focused on using the precious resource of compressed air as efficiently as possible. This work presents a sim2real reinforcement learning approach to efficiently hold a workpiece attached to a vacuum suction cup cluster. In addition to pure energy-saving, reinforcement learning enables those agents to be trained without collecting extensive data beforehand. Furthermore, the sim2real approach makes it easy and parallelizable to examine numerous agents by training them in a simulation of the testing rig rather than at the testing rig itself. The possibility to train various agents fast additionally facilitates focusing on the robustness and simplicity of the found agents instead of only searching for strategies that work, making training an intelligent system scalable and effective. The resulting agents reduce the amount of energy necessary to hold the workpiece attached by more than 15% compared to a reference strategy without machine learning and by more than 99% compared to a conventional strategy. © 2022, Publish-Ing in cooperation with TIB - Leibniz Information Centre for Science and Technology University Library.

"In order to remain competitive in a rapidly evolving, digital and connected world, production companies are faced with the task of delivering high quality individual products in shorter production times and fewer costs. In this sense, the major obstacle in front of the companies is the occurring problems in production. Shop floor management (SFM) is a central concept of the lean methodology, which aims to empower employees with the responsibility for the effective and long-term solution of problems and supports this point of view with daily meetings. However, due to the increasing diversity of variants in production, process activities and requirements have become more complex for employees. In this framework, the problem-solving methods have become a cause of extra stress for the employees and, as a consequence, the implementation of failure management systems is not feasible.

"Digital twin and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are considered key enablers for Industry 4.0 and sustainable intelligent manufacturing. The usage of digital twins in manufacturing processes leads to an enhancement in process understanding due to the continuous processing and evaluation of production data. Hence, when properly implemented, it empowers the ability to increase the agility, traceability, and resilience of production systems. Despite these merits, the scalability and fidelity of digital twins at the manufacturing field level are limited by heterogeneous data sources as well as modeling uncertainties, e.g., due to coarse approximation and imprecise parameter identification. This study proposes a novel approach to overcome these deficiencies by exploiting machine learning on aggregated data throughout the product development process. A procedure is established to contextualize metadata sources from the construction, planning, manufacturing, and quality stages into a quality feature-based digital thread. On this basis, a hybrid approach for quantifying modeling uncertainties across the model chain is developed by incorporating the production domain knowledge into AI techniques. As a result, the digital twin takes into account disturbances from the physical manufacturing environment and estimates the reliability of the modeled outcomes. An exemplary implementation of this concept is demonstrated by using a cutting-edge digital process twin for machining quality monitoring.  © 2022 IEEE.",0,10.1109/DASC/PiCom/CBDCom/Cy55231.2022.9928016,"This study proposes a novel approach to enhance the scalability and fidelity of digital twins in manufacturing by integrating machine learning with aggregated data across various stages of product development.

"Although large companies have progressed in digital transformation (DT) of factories using Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI), small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have not progressed enough. However, considering the efficiency and value creation of the entire supply chain, it is important to promote a smart factory in not only large companies but also SMEs. This study examines the success factors and mechanisms based on the case studies of Japanese SMEs that have successfully implemented smart factories. Then, its characteristics are compared with those of large companies. Specifically, in SMEs, where the top management and the factory floor are in close proximity, if the purposes and vision of DT are clear and the top management understands its possibilities and limitations, successful experiences can spread throughout the company through trial and error using an in-house system optimized for the factory floor.

"Purpose of the paper This paper studies the impact of digital technologies on the world of the future and implications for the Management of Technology (MOT). The deployment of digital technologies (e.g. social media, virtual communication infrastructure including Internet-of-things for hyper-connectivity, 3D printing, cloud services, big data analytics and artificial intelligence) in various industries and in the public sector is transforming innovation and competition rapidly. The paper examines two questions: (1) How do digital technologies transform industries and create the world of the future? (2) What are the implications for MOT? The paper draws on the literature on digitalization (Kagerman et al., 2013; Frank et al., 2019), ecosystem theory (Chertow, 2001; Holling, 1996; Iansiti and Richards, 2006), smart manufacturing, and Industry 4.0, which relies on digital technologies such as the Internet-of-Things (IOT), artificial intelligence to improve decision making and save costs (OECD, 2019), cloud services, big data and analytics to gather, store and analyze data in real time for decision making in various applications (Wang et al., 2015; Frank et al., 2019). These technologies enable digital transformation from physical to cyber-physical systems and accelerate the creation of linkages across entities - individuals, companies and nations. The paper also uses the definition of Management of Technology (MoT) by Botha (2020) and Bennett (2020) who note that MoT in the digital era involves the integration of science, engineering and management to augment intelligence in technology based organizations to create socio-technical ecosystems that provide dynamic benefits over time. Knowledge gained by interfacing with these socio-technical ecosystems enables the growth of the body of knowledge for MoT. This paper examines how MoT professionals need to adapt to build organizational and institutional mastery of emerging technologies. Design/Methodology/Approach The paper studies how digital transformation at organizational and industrial ecosystem levels is creating the world of the future. Scenario planning is used to develop four scenarios about future worlds. Designing a sustainable and desirable future requires Management of Technology experts to examine such scenarios as they provide the context for helping organizations and individuals envision how to meet the demands of the future. The scenarios are used to derive implications for the field of MoT. Findings The scenarios suggest that there may be differences across socio-technical ecosystems depending on differences in the use of digitalization - some future worlds may be at the technological frontier while others may lag. Implications for MoT professionals are also presented. Research limitations A limitation of the paper is that the impact of digital transformation is examined primarily through scenario planning and only four scenarios are presented. Practical implications The paper contributes insights on how to facilitate digital transformation that can help MoT experts and policy makers to prepare for the transformation arising from digital technologies. Originality/value of the paper The paper contributes to the MoT literature by delineating potential scenarios arising from the diffusion of digital technologies and applying literature on industrial ecosystems to the challenge of enabling socio-economic transformation.

Increasing the efficiency of MRO, as well as reducing MRO cost, is one of the main ways to reduce LCC. In modern aviation technology complexity of Avionics and its maintenance increase. Traditional methods of failure prediction are difficult to apply in complex technical systems which make it necessary to reduce MRO interval.

By comparing the performance of four machine learning (ML) algorithms, i.e., multiple linear regression (MLR), polynomial regression (PR), support vector regression (SVR), and backpropagation-artificial neural network (BP-ANN), it was found that machine learning models are superior in identifying the optimization of process parameters (pH and time) which lead to maintain key product quality indexes in the penetration procedure and binding procedure. Out of the four ML models, the BP-ANN algorithm and SVR algorithm are proven to have good predictive ability. Thus, we systematically optimized the chrome tanning process for energy saving, with key product quality as the constraints. The optimal process parameters, namely pickling pH of 2.86, penetration time of 90 min, pH after basifying of 4.08, and binding time of 90 min, were generated by solving the optimization models of the chrome tanning process via the genetic algorithm (GA) with powerful global optimization capability. Finally, it was validated that the optimized process was highly reliable by evaluating the wet blue product performances, such as the evenness of chrome distribution, thermal stability, surface reactivity, morphology, as well as physical and mechanical properties. Notably, compared to conventional chrome tanning, the optimized process will save 8353.33 kgce of energy and reduce 87295.6 kgCO2 of CO2 emission in an average tannery with an annual production capacity of 300,000 standard sheets of upper cowhide leather. This approach can precisely optimize conventional leather-making process, providing a fesible way to achieve energy-saving and low-carbon leather production. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",0,10.1016/j.jclepro.2024.142464,"This paper proposes an AI-assisted method to optimize the chrome tanning process in the leather-making industry, focusing on reducing CO2 emissions and improving energy efficiency.

"This research observes the relationship between industry 4.0 technologies (i.e., Internet of Things or IoT, machine learning, blockchain technology, and big data) and supply chain performance (SCP) with the mediating role of technological intensity in manufacturing firms using a resource-based view (RBV). Marketing strategy alignment is used as a moderator between technological intensity and SCP. The PLS-SEM is used, and 340 responses are used for the final analysis, collected using a simple random sampling technique. Multiple regressions were used to test hypotheses. IoT, blockchain technology, and technological intensity improve SCP. In contrast, machine learning and big data do not directly influence SCP. IoT, machine learning, big data, and blockchain technology significantly determine technological intensity. Besides, technological intensity significantly mediates industry 4.0 technologies and SCP. Finally, marketing strategy alignment strengthens the relationship between technological intensity and SCP.

"Non-return valve (NRV) is one of the key components in determining the consistency of the quality of the products molded by injection molding machine. Wear on the NRV affects the quality of the molded product. Nevertheless, detecting wear on the NRV can be challenging and disassembly of the machine is the only diagnostic method, which can have a negative impact on productivity. In this paper, a data-driven fault diagnosis method is proposed, which uses Stacked Auto Encoder (SAE) to analyze the pressure, torque, and displacement signals of the injection molding machine and combined with XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) to diagnose the faults of the NRV. The experimental results indicate that the SAE-XGBoost method accurately predicts NRV failures. Compared to using only XGBoost for prediction, the accuracy has improved from 97.5% to 99.6%. Eventually, the SAE-XGBoost model is integrated into the control program of the injection molding machine in the form of functional modules. Throughout the production process, the model adeptly monitors and identifies the production profile, promptly dispatching warning messages to users when diagnosing NRV wear. This facilitates intelligent diagnosis of the service status of injection molding machine components, which will have a positive influence on improving the production efficiency and intelligence of injection molding machines. The results of this study represent a synergistic application of artificial intelligence and time-domain statistical features in the realm of fault diagnosis for injection molding machines.

"Despite the increasing interest in understanding the relations between firms' digitalization and their environmental sustainability, they are still poorly understood as research on this hot topic is nascent and empirical evidence is sparse and fragmented. In this study, we delve into the relations between different digital data-driven technologies (DTs) used for gathering and storing (smart devices and cloud computing), analyzing (Big Data and Artificial Intelligence), and sharing data (Blockchain) and environmental sustainability in micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs). These firms, despite their relevance in the business landscape and their heterogeneity, are understudied in this area. Thus, we also examine the moderating role of firm size to understand the inherent diversity of MSMEs in the use of DTs and the development of the sustainability oriented practices. Empirical results from a large-scale representative sample of European enterprises show that the adoption of DTs for data gathering and analysis is positively associated with sustainability-oriented actions in MSMEs.

"Manufacturing companies are introducing innovative ways to facilitate the sustainable transition of their customers’ operations. The emerging literature on digital servitization proposes numerous factors, such as the use of advanced artificial intelligence analytics, orientation toward outcomes, and aligning ecosystem partnerships, which can potentially influence the sustainable performance of industrial customers. However, there is currently a lack of understanding regarding how these factors interact to result in sustainable outcomes. Hence, this study seeks to shed light on these complex relationships by identifying viable smart solution strategy configurations for achieving customer sustainable performance. Drawing on a dataset of 180 Swedish manufacturing firms, this study uses a configurational comparative method—namely, fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis—to identify the impact of different configurations of “AI-driven optimization,” “outcome orientation,” “value co-creation,” and “ecosystem orchestration” conditions on the realization of customer sustainable performance. This study has identified five smart solution strategies that empower manufacturers to realize sustainable performance for their customers. Among the five configurational strategies identified, the first configurational strategy appears to be the most prominent, as it is based on an outcome-based approach in which the firm uses its technological expertise and its ecosystem partnerships to take over customer operations.

"Purpose: Reverse logistics services are designed to move goods from their point of consumption to an endpoint to capture value or properly dispose of products and materials. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based reverse logistics will help Micro, Small, and medium Enterprises (MSMEs) adequately recycle and reuse the materials in the firms. This research aims to measure the adoption of AI-based reverse logistics to improve circular economy (CE) performance. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, we proposed ten hypotheses using the theory of natural resource-based view and technology, organizational and environmental framework. Data are collected from 363 Indian MSMEs as they are the backbone of the Indian economy, and there is a need for digital transformation in MSMEs. A structural equation modeling approach is applied to analyze and test the hypothesis. Findings: Nine of the ten proposed hypotheses were accepted, and one was rejected. The results revealed that the relative advantage (RA), trust (TR), top management support (TMS), environmental regulations, industry dynamism (ID), compatibility, technology readiness and government support (GS) positively relate to AI-based reverse logistics adoption. AI-based reverse logistics indicated a positive relationship with CE performance. For mediation analysis, the results revealed that RA, TR, TMS and technological readiness are complementary mediation.

"In the publishing industry, it is vital to comprehend customers’ needs and take their pleasure into account. Thus, publishing houses (PHs) must effectively address the necessity to increase profitability as well as minimize the waiting time of the printing requests in the queue. Although some researchers have studied publishing industries’ management, there is still a lack of research modeling PHs as a practical queueing system that reflects their performance precisely. Moreover, most models have not considered the machine learning technique for predicting the circulation of books integrated with a queueing model and mathematical programming. Furthermore, no study has modeled the PH as a M[X]/M/1 queueing system to practically improve the system. To fill these gaps, this paper develops a novel bi-objective mathematical model with a bulk arrival queueing system and a machine learning technique to minimize the total cost and maximize the resource utilization rate. Also, different machine learning classifier algorithms are implemented to estimate the circulation for each publishing product. Owing to the model’s bi-objective character, an enhanced LP-metrics method is presented.

"The uncertain and rapidly changing environment raises deep concerns about supply chain resilience (SCRe). Particularly in the small and medium enterprises (SMEs) settings, the lack of resources of SMEs becomes more pressure when considering SCRe. Although the literature on supply chain management and SCRe is increasing, understanding how artificial intelligence (AI) adoption can contribute value to SCRe needs further study. In this article, we aim to bridge the gap by examining an integrated framework of factors conceptually assumed to enable SCRe improvement. Grounded in information processing theory and dynamic capabilities view perspective, conceptually, AI has a relationship with SCRe; simultaneously, dynamic capabilities (DCs) mediate this relationship, and open innovation (OI) moderates the influence of AI on DC. The findings of this study suggest that, in the face of disruption and an uncertain environment, AI is a strategic tool for firms to improve DC and, ultimately, SCRe.

"The dynamic and volatile nature of fashion supply chains (FSCs) has drawn increasing attention from academia and the corporate sector. Fashion products, characterized by short lifecycles, impulse buying, and an unpredictable demand, necessitate that FSC partners rapidly offer on-trend products to capture the real-time demand in the shortest time window. To achieve this, FSC partners must embrace technological innovations, collaborate, and establish partnering relations, and share real-time information. Failure to do so will result in obsolete inventory and financial markdowns. In this article, we focus on identifying risk categories in FSC, such as social, environmental, economic, operational, reputational, market, product, disruption, complexity, and workforce, along with relevant mitigation strategies. A survey questionnaire is distributed to six fashion companies in the U.K., employing the fuzzy group analytical hierarchy process for pairwise comparisons to assess the importance of each risk category. Fuzzy failure modes and effect analysis is used to analyze the impact of each risk mitigation strategy on the risk factors. This study supports the extant empirical research in which resource sharing is an effective risk mitigation strategy for fashion risk management.

"More than 60 waste incineration plants (WIPs) are active across Germany. WIPs have various levels of automation, but they still rely on manual operations by human operators. Human operators tend to rely on a few operational levers and infrequent interventions to manage the complex combustion process. Consequently, the combustion process is managed rather inefficiently, and steam outputs and emission levels are not optimal. This article investigates how reinforcement learning (RL) can help enhance process automation and, thus, optimize the combustion process, e.g., by making more frequent and diverse interventions. An RL agent is trained via trial and error with a reward function that includes the optimization criteria. Since the actual equipment, i.e., the real WIP, cannot be used as the training environment, a digital twin is built using original plant data and a neural network. The RL agent is then trained in this offline environment with the deep Q-network algorithm. First, our work demonstrates that a digital twin of a WIP can be built in a data-driven way. Second, we show that the RL agent outperforms the human operator. Thus, the application of RL might benefit the plant operator in financial terms and the environment in terms of reduced emission levels.  © 1988-2012 IEEE.",0,10.1109/TEM.2022.3201434,"This paper explores the use of reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance the automation of waste incineration plants by optimizing the combustion process through more frequent interventions.

"This study aims to assess the economic resilience of manufacturing firms through a combination of output-oriented data envelopment analysis (DEA) and machine learning techniques. The research draws on economic resilience factors identified in the literature and focuses on three categories: economic-related factors (financial flexibility, microeconomic market, macroeconomic stability), production-related factors (restoration of production, backup inventories, resource pooling/sharing), and management-related factors (diversification of activities, good governance (management), relocation). Using DEA, a mathematical approach, the study computes and analyzes the contributions of various components to economic resilience. The results of DEA normalization indicate that the highest weighted criteria are financial flexibility, good governance (management), and resource pooling (sharing).

"Purpose: The integration of Lean Six Sigma (LSS) and Industry 4.0 (I4.0) is in the nascent stage and promises to achieve new optimums in operational excellence. This study aims to empirically examine the enablers, barriers, benefits and application of I4.0 technologies in LSS and I4.0 integration. Design/methodology/approach: A pilot survey was chosen as an appropriate methodology, as LSS and I4.0 integration is still budding. The survey targeted senior quality management professionals, quality managers, team leaders, LSS Black Belts and operations managers to collect the relevant research data. The questionnaire was sent to 200 respondents and received 53 valid responses. Findings: This study reveals that “top management support” is an essential enabler for LSS and I4.0 integration. The most significant barrier was “poor understanding of data analysis” and “lack of top management support”. The findings further illustrated that LSS and I4.0 integration resulted in greater efficiency, lower operational costs, improved productivity, improved customer satisfaction and improved quality. Regarding I4.0 technology integration at different phases of LSS, the authors noticed that big data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) are the most prominent technologies used in all phases of LSS implementation. Research limitations/implications: One of the limitations of this study is the sample size. LSS and I4.0 are emerging concepts; hence, obtaining a larger sample size is difficult. In addition, the study used non-parametric tests to analyse the data. Therefore, future studies should be conducted with large sample sizes across different continents and countries to understand differences in the key findings. Practical implications: The outcomes of this study can be useful for organisational managers to understand the enablers and barriers before integrating LSS and I4.0 for adoption in their organisations. Secondly, it helps to convince top management and human resource personnel by providing a list of benefits of LSS and I4.0 integration.

"The article attempts to overcome the lack of protectionism policy underlying the existing approach to managing sustainable business development, which is due to the fact that such a policy limits the influence of the external environment on business, as well as eliminates its incentives to adaptation and reduces business flexibility. The research methodology is based on the use of the method of regression analysis. Based on the representative international statistics by IMD and the UN for 2021 (60 countries), we use regression analysis to determine the dependence of the indicators of the sustainable development of the business—GDP and SDG 9—on the factors of protectionism and the use of Big Data and analytics based on AI. The reliability of the econometric modeling results is verified by determining their correspondence to the Gauss–Markov theorem. The key conclusion is that change management based on smart technologies contributes to sustainable business development, expressed in an increase in GDP and the result of SDG 9 implementation. The significance of the managerial aspect of the article is that, using the progressive methodology of SAP–LAP, we compile a SAP–LAP model of change management based on smart technologies for sustainable business development, which makes it possible to increase its flexibility and adaptability. The main result of this paper consists in the substantiation of the critical role of the flexibility of business as the main condition for its sustainable development. The paper’s novelty lies in the development of a new approach to the management of the sustainable development of the business, which specific feature is change management based on smart technologies—which ensures increased flexibility of the business.

"In recent years, Machine Learning (ML) applications for manufacturing have reached a high degree of maturity and can be considered a suitable tool for improving production performance. In addition, ML applications can be used in many other production areas to enhance sustainability within the manufacturing process. One area is storing and transporting bulk materials in metal Intermediate Bulk Containers (IBC). These IBCs are currently used solely for their primary purpose of storage and transportation of raw and finished goods. Hence, while in use, IBCs are often a black box, not providing additional value to manufacturers. Equipping IBCs with sensor technology can provide such value: new data can be generated along the entire supply chain and production processes, taking the sustainability of production to a new level. Within the research project smart.CONSERVE, we use this additional data, for example, to monitor the stored food's critical characteristics or to establish predictive maintenance for IBCs. Thus, storing produced goods in defective IBCs can be avoided, and wasting resources can be prevented. This publication describes how smart IBCs in the food industry can increase supply chain visibility and reduce food waste. To illustrate this, we present possible data-related use cases enabled by smart IBCs, provide insights into how these use cases can be transferred to other industries, and exemplify the many opportunities for manufacturers to develop new smart services and ML applications based on the collected data – and how this can support manufacturers in achieving higher levels of sustainability. © 2023, Publish-Ing in cooperation with TIB - Leibniz Information Centre for Science and Technology University Library.

"Due to the worsening climate change drastic changes in the transportation sector are necessary. Crucial factors for sustainable energy supply are reliable and economical energy storage systems. Associated with that is the development of giga factories with a capacity of up to 1000 GWh in 2030 in Europe (currently 25 GWh) for the production of battery cells especially for the automotive sector, which is one of the largest emitters of greenhouse gases in Europe. In addition to the required investments, high scrap rates due to unknown interdependencies within the process chain represent a central challenge within battery cell production. Another key challenge in series production is the product tracking along the value chain, which consists of continuous, batch and discrete processes. Because of its complexity the battery cell production industry is predestined for Industry 4.0 applications in order to meet the current challenges and to make battery cell production more efficient and sustainable. Digital twins and the use of AI algorithms enable the identification of previously unknown cause-effect relationships and thus a product improvement and increased efficiency. In this paper, the digital twin of a battery cell production will be developed. For this purpose, general requirements for the field of battery cell production are first determined and relevant parameters from the literature as well as from a production pilot line are defined.

"The operation of CNC milling is expensive because of the cost-intensive use of cutting tools. The wear and tear of CNC tools influence the tool lifetime. Today’s machines are not capable of accurately estimating the tool abrasion during the machining process. Therefore, manufacturers rely on reactive maintenance, a tool change after breakage, or a preventive maintenance approach, a tool change according to predefined tool specifications. In either case, maintenance costs are high due to a loss of machine utilization or premature tool change. To find the optimal point of tool change, it is necessary to monitor CNC process parameters during machining and use advanced data analytics to predict the tool abrasion. However, data science expertise is limited in small-medium sized manufacturing companies. The long operating life of machines often does not justify investments in new machines before the end of operating life. The publication describes a cost-efficient approach to upgrade legacy CNC machines with a Tool Wear Prediction Upgrade Kit. A practical solution is presented with a holistic hardware/software setup, including edge device, and multiple sensors. The prediction of tool wear is based on machine learning.

"This paper contributes to the literature on the adoption of disruptive technologies for the transition to more sustainable societies by mapping businesses' uptake in the Italian region of Piedmont from the perspective of innovation ecosystems. Despite their relevance for sustainability and competitiveness, evidence on the European Union indicates major weaknesses in the adoption of crucial disruptive technologies, recommending a stronger focus on the local and regional levels. This could be achieved via the perspective of innovation ecosystems so as to identify and strengthen industrial synergies in technology adoption, but current systematic research in this vein is limited by a lack of consistent and publically available data. Aiming to fill this gap, this study developed a highly scalable approach to map business actors and their uptake of emerging technologies. First, textual information on over 17,000 organizations operating in Piedmont was retrieved from the social network LinkedIn. Second, elementary text-mining techniques were used to verify their engagement with 5G Networks, Advanced Robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Autonomous Drive, Blockchain, and Drones. Third, uptakes within and across industries were statistically assessed. This identified 1273 businesses pertaining to 115 different sectors that already engaged with at least one of the abovementioned technological innovations, displayed some industrial synergies and complementarities, and confirmed key barriers to their uptake.

"IBM has deployed its Predictive Analytics for Server Incident Reduction (PASIR) solution to more than 360 information technology (IT) environments worldwide since 2013. These environments, covering sectors from banking to travel to e-commerce, are serviced by IBM support groups. Incidents occurring on servers, including problem descriptions and resolutions, are documented in client account-specific ticket management systems. PASIR uses machine learning to classify the incident tickets within an IT environment and identify high-impact incidents that involve server outages by using the respective ticket descriptions and resolutions. It then correlates these high-impact tickets with server properties and utilization measurements to identify problematic server configurations. Finally, for such configurations, PASIR uses statistical multivariate analysis and simulation methods to prescribe improvement and modernization actions. In this paper, we present the results achieved from deploying this solution. We describe the PASIR approach, from ticket classification to the recommendations of remediation actions (e.g., hardware and software upgrades).

"Advanced Manufacturing or Industry 4.0 concepts bring new advances and challenges to current industrial processes. Such concepts are not always well understood and their results in terms of production performance may not be clear. This work proposes a comparison between a traditional manufacturing process and an advanced manufacturing process, both modelled by a multiagent society. In the traditional manufacturing simulation, the agents follow the defined times of each process, including the maintenance times. In the advanced manufacturing simulation, the decision about when to stop a piece of equipment for maintenance is defined by the agent according to data received from sensors and the definitions of the process. The results indicate a significant improvement in equipment usage and consequently higher production in the same time interval. The process simulation clearly indicates that the application of advanced manufacturing concepts in industry is relevant in order to increase the efficiency of production processes. Among the main concepts introduced in advanced manufacturing models are the Internet of Things (IoT), Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs), and Artificial Intelligence (AI). The models generated are computationally simulated using an agent-based simulation method from the software AnyLogic.

"Changing customer demands lead to increasing product varieties and decreasing delivery times, which in turn pose great challenges for production companies. Combined with high market volatility, they lead to increasingly complex and diverse production processes. Thus, the susceptibility to disruptions in manufacturing rises, turning the task of Production Planning and Control (PPC) into a complex, dynamic and multidimensional problem. Addressing PPC challenges such as disruption management in an efficient and timely manner requires a high level of manual human intervention. In times of digitization and Industry 4.0, companies strive to find ways to guide their workers in this process of disruption management or automate it to eliminate human intervention altogether. This paper presents one possible application of Machine Learning (ML) in disruption management on a real-life use case in mixed model continuous production, specifically in the final assembly. The aim is to ensure high-quality online decision support for PPC tasks. This paper will therefore discuss the use of ML to anticipate production disruptions, solutions to efficiently highlight and convey the relevant information, as well as the generation of possible reaction strategies.

"As the economic manufacturing of high-quality products becomes an increasingly crucial competitive factor, corresponding quality assurance measures are gaining a growing interest. Even though research interest and industrial demand are both high, there is a large gap between methological approaches and practical applicability that needs to be closed. In this paper we therefore present a practical framework for advanced quality-based process control (AQPC) in interlinked manufacturing processes. Machine learning algorithms are used to predict the expected product quality based on recorded process parameters. That information then serves as an input for the derivation of optimal control decisions.

"Purpose: Recent disruptions have sparked concern about building a resilient and sustainable manufacturing supply chain. While artificial intelligence (AI) strengthens resilience, research is needed to understand how cloud adoption can foster integration, collaboration, adaptation and sustainable manufacturing. Therefore, this study aimed to unleash the power of cloud adoption and AI in optimizing resilience and sustainable performance through collaboration and adaptive capabilities at manufacturing firms. Design/methodology/approach: This research followed a deductive approach and employed a quantitative method with a survey technique to collect data from its target population. The study used stratified random sampling with a sample size of 1,279 participants working in diverse manufacturing industries across California, Texas and New York.

"Interorganizational collaboration and the use of new digital technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), big data analytics, internet of things (IoT), or blockchain technology, are regarded as key enablers in implementing sustainability and circular economy-oriented practices. While this is reflected in a few conceptual and case studies, statistical analyses on the topic are rare. No study so far has focused on collaboration, and digital technologies have only been studied in isolation. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of interorganizational collaboration practices on a firm's circular economy practices and on outcomes (sustainability performance and economic performance), as well as the potentially facilitative role of new digital technologies on both. The research is based on a deductive approach, using a random sample of 112 Austrian manufacturing companies. The study employs partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM), features a multiple-respondent design, and uses the dynamic capabilities view as a theoretical foundation. The study finds that interorganizational collaboration practices have a strong positive effect on the implementation of sustainability and CE practices, while the use of new digital technologies and general dynamic capabilities do not. The use of digital technologies positively affects only interorganizational collaboration, while general dynamic capabilities serve as an antecedent for both the use of digital technologies and interorganizational collaboration. Regarding the outcomes of CE implementation, the study finds a positive impact on firm-level sustainability and economic performance. From a theoretical point of view, the study provides a new perspective on the prerequisites for successful CE implementation, highlights the importance of collaboration, and contextualizes the role of new digital technologies and dynamic capabilities. From a practical point of view, based on the positive outcomes found, the study supports arguments in favor of company engagement in CE activity.

"Artificial intelligence (AI) approaches, such as deep learning models, are increasingly used to determine risks in construction. However, the black-box nature of AI models makes their inner workings difficult to understand and interpret. Deploying explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) can help explain why and how the output of AI models is generated. This article addresses the following research question: How can we accurately identify the critical factors influencing tunnel-induced ground settlement and provide counterfactual explanations to support risk-based decision-making? We apply an XAI approach using counterfactual explanations to help understand decision-making surrounding risks when considering control ground settlement. Our approach consists of a: 1) construction of Kernel principal components analysis-based deep neural network (DNN) model; 2) generation of counterfactual explanations; 3) analysis of risk prediction and assessment factors' importance, necessity, and sufficiency. We apply our approach to the San-yang road tunnel project in Wuhan, China. The results demonstrate that the KPCA-DNN model better predicted ground settlement based on high-dimensional input features than the baseline model (i.e., AdaBoost and RandomForest). The bubble chamber pressure→ cutter-head speed→ equipment inclination is also identified as the primary risk path. Our findings indicate that using counterfactual explanations enables transparency and trust in AI-based risk models to be acquired.

"Purpose: The artificial intelligence (AI) based total productive maintenance (TPM) condition based maintenance (CBM) approach through Industry 4.0 transformation can well predict the breakdown in advance to eliminate breakdown. Design/methodology/approach: Meeting the customer requirement as per the delivery schedule with the existing resources are always a big challenge in industries. Any catastrophic breakdown in the equipment leads to increase in production loss, damage to machines, repair cost, time and affects delivery. If these breakdowns are predicted in advance, the breakdown can be addressed before its occurrence and the demand supply chain can be met. TPM is one of the essential operational excellence tool used in industries to utilize the existing resources of a plant in a optimal way.

"Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based applications have been rising across the healthcare supply chain. Successful AI implementation requires proper collaboration among healthcare supply chain members. However, high investment associated with AI innovation often impedes collaboration. In this context, disruption caused by the disasters like pandemics and epidemics can add more complexity. This issue has not received substantial scholarly attention. Here, we design a multi-level AI-enabled healthcare supply chain by incorporating a three-level supply chain structure with a healthcare product manufacturer, a distributor, and a procurement agency, where the manufacturer and distributor invest in AI innovation. Here, we adopt wholesale price (W) and cost-sharing (C) contracts-based mechanisms considering four scenarios WW, WC, CW, and CC, to devise the three-level AI-enabled healthcare supply chain members’ collaboration and coordination strategies with and without disruption. Adopting a Stackelberg game-theoretic approach, we determine the supply chain members’ optimal AI innovation efforts, prices, and profits for all scenarios. We demonstrate the dominance of one scenario over other for the supply chain members’ decisions and profits and propose a scenario ranking framework.

"This article investigates the adoption patterns of Industry 4.0 (I4.0) technologies in the automotive component sector and links I4.0 adoption to competitive strategies. Analysis of survey data concerning 288 automotive suppliers reveals that most firms currently focus on implementing real-time collection and analysis of production data (i.e., the Internet of Things, Big Data, and Artificial Intelligence), while other technologies, such as additive manufacturing and blockchain, are infrequently adopted. I4.0 adoption is associated with a simultaneous strategic emphasis on cost, quality, and delivery, thus suggesting automotive suppliers look at I4.0 as a mean to overcome performance tradeoffs. Findings also confirm that small- and medium-sized firms are less likely to adopt I4.0.

"The grid management strategy is an innovation of the grid time management mode. Its essence is to divide the management objectives into geographical micro-regional units according to certain standards. Through the grid-based management information system, the information exchange between units and the integration of business activities are realized, thus forming a seamless management system and finally realizing the optimal configuration of management resources. Although the definition, function and mode of grid management and other key issues have not been clearly and universally clarified, grid management is being applied to public life at a highly rapid pace and has achieved relatively obvious results. Yet, few studies apply grid management to enterprise management. On this basis, this study uses machine learning and Strengths, Weaknesses Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT) Analysis (also known as strong and weak crisis, strengths and weaknesses analysis) to analyse enterprise grid innovation management. Six enterprises are selected for investigation and feasibility conclusions are drawn. After the adoption of grid management measures, the work efficiency of the six enterprises and the tacit understanding of employees of each enterprise both show significant improvements. The resource integration of each enterprise is higher than 70%.

"Due to the growing number of variants and smaller batch sizes manufacturing companies have to cope with increasing material flow complexity. Thus, increasing the difficulty for production planning and control (PPC) to create a feasible and economic production plan. Despite significant advances in PPC research, current PPC systems do not yet sufficiently meet the industry’s requirements (e.g., decision quality, reaction time, user trust). However, recent progress in the digitalization of production systems results in an increased amount of data being collected, thus enabling the use of data-intensive applications technologies, e.g., machine learning (ML). ML provides new possibilities for PPC to handle increasing complexity caused by rising numbers of product variants paired with smaller lot sizes. At the same time, ML can increase the decision quality and reduce the reaction time to disturbances in the production system, e.g., machine breakdowns. Partly, ML models, e.g., artificial neural networks (ANN), are perceived as black-box models, resulting in reduced user’s trust in the decision proposed by an ML-based PPC system. The approach presented in this publication aims at a more functional and user-friendly PPC system by leveraging multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), an accomplished approach within the field of ML-based production control, and approaches for explaining decisions made by reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. With the help of MARL, short reaction time and high decision quality can be realized. Subsequently, the developed MARL system is combined with methods from the field of explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to increase the users’ trust.

"Processing carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) to generate oxygen (O 2 ) is one of the challenges in developing life support systems for human presence in space. Algae is known for growing its biomass through photosynthesis, producing O 2 , and fixing CO 2 400 times more efficiently than trees. Algae cultivation in a controlled environment requires maintaining proper conditions to extend healthy culture growth and life cycles. Terrestrially, relatively large facilities (raceway ponds) cultivate algae. This is not adequate for the integration into spacecraft or buildings due to mass and volume constraints. These large terrestrial systems do not fully utilize artificial intelligence (AI), based on data analysis, to achieve optimal growth. Hypergiant developed a small-scale bioreactor prototype as a commercial and open-source platform, focused on addressing life support systems in space and the growing concern of climate change. This autonomous system is grouped into several design aspects such as mechanical, electronics, sensors, and data monitoring. Sensor clusters collected measurements about the biological and environmental status. Then, AI algorithms utilized these data, such as the concentration of O 2 and CO 2 , pH, turbidity, temperature, and optical density to automatically adjust the cultivation environment by cascade control. In this study, we formulate the CO 2 absorption process model and define input and output parameters. We also present the results of testing an optical density sensor developed in-house. The results indicated that the optical density sensor has high accuracy and repeatability over a range of light intensities, capable of measuring a dense algal culture. The desktop dashboard presented the integrated platform, including input measurement data from the sensor array and resulting automatic output controls. Additional applications, including terrestrial use, and future work with this platform are included.

"Forecasting of demands of perishable goods is cru-cial in planning production schedules to satisfy customer needs on time, and to lower the profit losses of over or under stocks. Collaboration with one of local the supermarket chains provided a reasonable foundation for this academic study to optimize the forecasting of deliveries of perishable goods for food supply chains. By carefully analyzing its logistics operations and real-time data of short-shelf life product deliveries, it is discovered that the current supply management of the stores is solely based on prior managerial experiences, taking into consideration the spoilage, stock-out rates, and holiday seasons. Sudden change in demand causes problems to managers who struggle with keeping up with unpredictable frequency, type, and quantity of goods delivered to a particular place from an assigned warehouse.

"Due to the rise of new information and communication technologies manufacturing companies have access to huge amounts of power consumption data which are measured by sensors and processed by information systems. One of the most promising applications of extracting value out of the collected data is the detection of anomalies in process data from industrial machines and equipment. Many research and industry use cases apply machine learning (ML) techniques for anomaly detection. These techniques enable manufacturing companies to optimize their manufacturing processes but also to be more energy efficient and therefore have an impact for sustainable manufacturing. Most of the ML applications use central server infrastructures for data collection from different sources to process and analyse it for further usage. Nevertheless, privacy concerns and security risks motivate manufacturers to store the collected sensitive data from the production line locally. Therefore, suppliers of industrial machines (e.g. robots, machine tools) do not have the possibility, to store and analyse the data in the cloud, where data from all the machines of the supplier in different companies could be analysed and used for ML applications. One of the new paradigm shifts in ML is the concept of federated learning (FL) which enables local devices to use ML without sending data to a central server. This paper introduces an architecture for using the concepts of FL in manufacturing processes enabling machine suppliers to use ML for optimizing machine processes in a collaborative manner. Therefore, the more general federated learning concept is extended for industrial machinery and equipment using the industrial communication framework OPC-UA.

"Because of the characteristics of high temperature, high pressure, flammability, explosion and high risk, safety accidents occur frequently in petroleum industry. In order to avoid and prevent safety accidents, it is necessary to promote the construction of safety culture in petroleum industry. With the progress of science and technology, some intelligent technologies (such as artificial intelligence, virtual reality, augmented reality, etc.) have become an indispensable means for the construction of safety culture. Safety culture has experienced fatalism, empiricism, systematism and essentialism, and its connotation has been constantly enriched and innovated. Essentialism, in the final analysis, emphasizes the prevention and prevention of safety accidents, and holds that safety science and technology is the prerequisite to ensure safe production. Artificial intelligence (AI), virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) are the representatives of the most advanced productive forces, and their mature application scenarios in the construction of safety culture are more and more, such as intelligent hazard identification, emergency drilling, safety knowledge dissemination and so on. Artificial intelligence is a science that studies the laws of human intelligence activities and can simulate some human behaviors. Intelligent robots that store safety knowledge and safety laws and regulations can publicize and train safety production knowledge and warn unsafe behavior through machine learning and natural language processing.

"The lives of U.S. soldiers in combat depend on complex weapon systems and advanced technologies. In combat conditions, the resources available to support the operation and maintenance of these systems are minimal. Following the failure of a critical system, technical support personnel may take days to arrive via helicopter or ground convoy-leaving soldiers and civilian experts exposed to battlefield risks. To address this problem, the U.S. Army Communications Electronics Command (CECOM) developed a suite of systems, Virtual Logistics Assistance Representative (VLAR), with a single purpose: to enable a combat soldier to maintain critical equipment. The CECOM VLAR team uses an operations research (OR) approach to codifying expert knowledge about Army equipment and applying that knowledge to troubleshooting equipment diagnostics in combat situations. VLAR infuses a classic knowledge-management spiral with OR techniques: from socializing advanced technical concepts and eliciting tacit knowledge, to integrating expert knowledge, to creating an intuitive and instructive interface, and finally, to making VLAR a part of a soldier's daily life. VLAR is changing the Army's sustainment paradigm by creating an artificial intelligence capability and applying it to equipment diagnostics. In the process, it has generated a sustainable cost-savings model and a means to mitigate combat risk.

The study investigates the impact of BDA capabilities, solid IT infrastructure, managerial views, and AI-apprehensions on the effectiveness of risk alert tools using a questionnaire-based survey of 420 managerial personnel and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) via SMART PLS. The work proposes the concept of AI-Apprehensions as a moderating variable, which is a relatively unexplored field. According to the findings, while BDA capabilities and IT infrastructure considerably improve the effectiveness of risk alert tools, AI-apprehensions can negate these advantages.

"Artificial intelligence and machine learning are key technologies for purchasing organizations worldwide and their usage is still in a nascent stage. This systematic review offers an overview of the state-of-the-art literature and practice, where 46 works meeting the inclusion criteria were interactively classified in 11 use case clusters. The work follows the content analysis approach where the material evaluation was empirically enriched with 20 interviews to assess the cluster's business value and ease of implementation through triangulation. This is the first systematic review in the area of operations and supply chain management utilizing the Computer Classification System as the de facto standard in computer science for clarity in the terminology of these emerging technologies. In matching the literature search with the interview results, a mismatch was found between the reviewed literature and the expert's assessments. For instance, the cluster cost analysis deserves higher research attention as well as supplier sustainability. Moreover, there seems to be a gap in the operational area, which many believe to be first considered due to data availability.

"With a plethora of digital technologies, and some having high capital and running costs, it is critical to know which of these give architectural, engineering, and construction (AEC) firms a comparative advantage. Comparative advantage is measured using these metrics: higher project quality (Y1), productivity (Y2), ability to win tenders (Y3), and reputation (Y4), compared to AEC firms' nearest competitors. This study investigated which specific digital technologies give rise to a comparative advantage for adopters in the AEC sector. The research design was an online survey using a structured questionnaire. Data were collected from AEC professionals in Singapore. The research found that the adoption of five digital technologies is significantly associated with higher project quality, productivity, and reputation compared to AEC firms' nearest competitors. These 'super technologies' are cloud-based technology, design for manufacturing and assembly (DfMA), Internet-of-Things (IoT), robotic technology, and artificial intelligence (AI). The study discovered some digital technologies that are not correlated with any comparative advantage metrics. The contribution to knowledge is the creation of the digital technology adoption model that potential adopters may use to help them decide which specific digital technologies to adopt to achieve comparative advantage. For firms that are already adopting digital technologies, the adoption model serves as a benchmarking tool to measure comparative advantage. The implication for practice is for potential adopters to zoom in on the 'super technologies' and eschew those that do not provide comparative advantages.  © 2023 American Society of Civil Engineers.",0,10.1061/JCEMD4.COENG-13743,"This study examines which digital technologies provide a comparative advantage to architectural, engineering, and construction (AEC) firms, using an online survey to collect data from professionals in Singapore.

"Our research reveals the continued and evolving role of the human factor in decision making in digitalized retail supply chains. We compare managerial roles in a pre- and post-COVID era through conducting in-depth interviews of 25 executives spanning the retail supply chain ecosystem. We use grounded theory to develop four main contributions. First, we find that the involvement of managerial judgment is found to be progressively greater moving up the retail supply chain, away from the customer and the demand signal. Second, integration of analytics and judgment is now the primary method of decision making, and we identify elements needed for success. Third, we develop an essential framework for a successful integration process. Fourth, we isolate the necessary components of a successful process for analytics/artificial intelligence (AI) implementation.

"Purpose: Poor performance remains a challenge for the construction industry worldwide. One of the key performance indicators of the construction industry is the timely delivery of projects. Despite the recent methodological and technological advances in the field, project-overrun remains a significant challenge for the industry. This paper seeks to propose practical solutions that allow overcoming the challenges and promote the opportunities for improving the performance of the construction projects in Dubai. Design/methodology/approach: This study focussed on the construction projects in Dubai; therefore, this research adopted a sequential mixed approach in two stages. The first stage involved face-to-face interviews with seven carefully selected construction professionals. Their answers were analysed to provide with the literature study “the informed-basis for the development of the online questionnaire”. The second stage involved an online survey administrated to 425 carefully selected construction organisations working in Dubai. Accordingly, a meticulous analysis for the prime causes of project overruns has also been undertaken. This analysis assisted proposing the most suitable solutions-based technologies that enabled alleviating overruns in the construction projects. Findings: The findings revealed that, there was a consensus agreement on the formidable opportunities for improving the performance of the construction industry in general and in particular in Dubai. These opportunities are intrinsically linked with the adoption of the latest technologies such as building information modelling, augmented reality, virtual reality and the artificial intelligence (AI). Whereas, adopting AI has already assisted two public authorities to release No Objection Certificates and work permits effectively within one day instead of 14 working days, which has saved 90% of the time and cost. Likewise, adoption of the AI has assisted delivering the construction project with a 9% of time saving and a 6% of cost saving due to embracing an automated system that enabled them to instantly detect and report the delays, once occurred. Research limitations/implications: The main limitation of this study is that the study was limited to the construction industry in the Emirate of Dubai. Therefore, future research could target the whole United Arab Emirates construction industry to propose the practical solution on the country level. Practical implications: The literature study is replete with solutions, which tend to be theoretical more than practical. Therefore, the proposed practical recommendations will significantly assist the construction industry to improve its suboptimal performance to rescind the sovereignty of the irrelevant involvements. The research recommended establishing independent entity to lead the change in the construction industry; this entity will have the power of enacting rules and legislations. Furthermore, this independent entity will have the power and authority of dictations and impose sanctions on the non-committed organisations that are reluctant to adopt the recommended technologies and approaches.

"Anaerobic digestion (AD) of tannery effluents generated by beamhouse processes is limited by ammonia and sulfur species. High sulfate concentrations in beamhouse effluents (BHE) promote sulfidogenesis during AD, and the hydrogen sulfide that is generated inhibits methanogenesis. The feasibility of using a novel integrated biological system that comprised of hybrid linear flow channel reactor/s (HLFCR/s) and an anaerobic sequential batch reactor (AnSBR) connected in series mainly for the pre-treatment and recovery of elemental sulfur (S0) and methane (CH4) was investigated. The application of single-stage and two-stage HLFCR topology operating at 8 and 4 days’ hydraulic retention times (HRT), respectively, produced effluents that were ideal for AD. Single-stage HLFCR (8-days HRT) recovered 21% of the inlet sulfur and the downstream effluent treatment in continuously mixed AnSBR at 50 rpm achieved 238 mL CH4/gCODadded). The full-scale application of the system at a local medium sized tannery treating 2258 m3 of BHE would produce a floating sulfur biofilm with 33% S0, 3420 m3 of CH4, 50 m3 of irrigation water and 31 tonnes of biofertiliser. The sale of recovered resources and potential savings from a 72% reduction in electricity demand and 62% in sludge disposal had a potential revenue of US$5559.

"This study analyses the impact of digitalization on the Buyer Supplier relationship (BSR) in the context of Industry 4.0. An empirical qualitative research methodology was employed, with semi-structured interviews conducted with 23 procurement specialists from service sector organizations in India to obtain empirical data. A qualitative content analysis was then conducted to arrive at common patterns and ideas. The study found that procurement specialists perceive that digitalization has an overall positive impact on buyer supplier relationship. However, it is important to exercise diligence during the implementation of any digital tools to restrict dissatisfaction, and human touch is essential in certain areas like negotiation and conflict management. Additionally, data analysis can provide strategic advantages, but the quality of input data must be considered. The study highlights the positive and negative impacts of digitalization on BSR and provides implications for research and corporate practice.

"The purpose of the paper is to investigate the functions of artificial intelligence in supply chain management. In recent years, artificial intelligence framework has accomplished human-like performances in various previously considered computationally impossible tasks. Better access to large amounts of information, improved algorithms, and advanced hardware systems have led to artificial technology development. Artificial technology has supported business organisations to enhance their data collection abilities with the rapid advancement of different tools. If a product depends on supplies from multiple suppliers, disruptions can have subsequent effects. Organisations must redesign supply chains, improve flexibility, and re-evaluate the relationship with suppliers to reduce systematic risks.

"A defining feature of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic was a pervasive and palpable collapse of sense-making in individuals and organisations. A key factor underlying this chaos was the inability of humans to make sense of the big and noisy data environment. Such big data environments are especially amenable to interpretation by Artificial intelligence. In this study, a theoretical framework has been developed for the use of AI for sense-making in survival supply chains. The proposed framework, ‘The Cognitive Model of Survival Supply Chains’, is articulated as consisting of scan, store, interpret, execute, and learn as its purposive components. This framework is presented as a scaffolding to organise extant knowledge, identify gaps, synthesise new knowledge, and guide future research and practice.

"Owing to the development of artificial intelligence, smart manufacturing has extensively been investigated, which has rapidly increased manufacturing productivity. The most prevalent smart manufacturing application using machine learning is product quality enhancement through surface and dimensional defect detection. Various sensors, such as stereoscopic, 2D, or 3D lasers as well as structured light sensors, have been used to perform precise thickness measurements. These sensors are expensive and they require a large space for installation in a factory, which consumes time and energy. Moreover, micro-scale dimensional measurement equipment is much more expensive and easily damaged by environmental changes such as temperature and humidity. In the beginning, we introduce a single image-based 3D measurement system using depth estimation that makes dimensional anomaly detection easy and fast. This is important for green technology because the proposed method can reduce condemned or inferior goods by detecting anomalies early and save raw materials and energy consumption. The existing method is deep learning based depth estimation. However, it is difficult for conventional depth estimation methods to predict 3D measurement directly because of the difference between depth estimation and 3D measurement. That is because inputs are discontinuous dimensional values with homogeneous textures. Conventional depth estimation is a regression task that assumes inputs are continuous. To circumvent this problem, we propose a magnifier loss. In addition, to overcome the object’s homogeneity and meet the micro-scale dimensional precision requirement, this paper proposes a novel magnifier transformation function that magnifies the homogeneous textures and micro-scale dimensional value changes. This method achieves better quantitative performance than a conventional computer vision method, stereo-matching approaches, and even a structured light sensor, which is known to be one of most accurate and expensive sensors for a 3D measurement system. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Korean Society for Precision Engineering.",0,10.1007/s40684-022-00434-y,"This paper presents a novel single image-based 3D measurement system using depth estimation to enhance product quality in smart manufacturing by detecting dimensional anomalies.

"In this paper, we propose a site-wide lead advisor, which is an artificial intelligence-based prediction and set-point recommendation engine, by combining the use of machine learning with optimization techniques. It provides operational set-point recommendations to continuously improve site-wide operations for throughput measured in additional barrels of oil produced per day. A key contribution and differentiator is the utilization of sensor data to continuously learn the behavior of all the subsystems of an oil-producing plant and use this within an optimization framework to provide advisory control in near real time. This is novel in that it does not require a model of the plant to be provided as input. The predictive model is learned automatically and continuously from data.

"Sales and Operations Planning (S&OP ) is a process that aims to align dimensioning efforts in a company, based on one integrated plan and with clear decision milestones. The alignment is cross-functional and connects different operations functions with each other to set an overall delivery ability. There are always challenges connecting different functions in a company which most S&OP practitioners agree with, still, that is one of the things that the S&OP -process should bridge. Digital solutions such as Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and other more or less sophisticated tools have contributed to an improved cross functional communication over time.

"In our contribution, we consider how the Digital Twin of the production system can be combined with Artificial Intelligence methods. The result of these considerations should be a hybrid production management system, which can be used for decision support as well as for self-control.

On the other hand, Artificial Intelligence is taking over some elements and tasks with automatic control (independent of human interaction). If the result is out of tolerance or if a random sample of the result is audited, the decision support system is validating the Artificial Intelligence result for execution (by human interaction).

"Cost estimation may become increasingly difficult, slow, and resource-consuming when it cannot be performed analytically. If traditional cost estimation techniques are usable at all under those circumstances, they have important limitations. This article analyses the potential applications of data science to management accounting, through the case of a cost estimation task posted on Kaggle, a Google data science and machine learning website. When extensive data exist, machine learning techniques can overcome some of those limitations. Applying machine learning to the data reveals non-obvious patterns and relationships that can be used to predict costs of new assemblies with acceptable accuracy. This article discusses the advantages and limitations of this approach and its potential to transform cost estimation, and more widely management accounting. The multinational company Caterpillar posted a contest on Kaggle to estimate the price that a supplier would quote for manufacturing a number of industrial assemblies, given historical quotes for similar assemblies. Hitherto, this problem would have required reverse-engineering the supplier’s accounting structure to establish the cost structure of each assembly, identifying non-obvious relationships among variables.

"Purpose: The main purpose of this paper is to propose a methodological approach and a decision support tool, based on prescriptive analytics, to enable bulk ordering of spare parts for shipping companies operating fleets of vessels. The developed tool utilises Machine Learning (ML) and operations research algorithms, to forecast and optimize bulk spare parts orders needed to cover planned maintenance requirements on an annual basis and optimize the company’s purchasing decisions. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed approach consists of three discrete methodological steps, each one supported by a decision support tool based on clustering and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. In the first step, clustering is applied in order to identify high interest items. Next, a forecasting tool is developed for estimating the expected needs of the fleet and to test whether the needed quantity is influenced by the source of purchase. Finally, the selected items are cost-effectively allocated to a group of vendors. The performance of the tool is assessed by running a simulation of a bulk order process on a mixed fleet totaling 75 vessels. Findings: The overall findings and approach are quite promising Indicatively, shifting demand planning focus to critical spares, via clustering, can reduce administrative workload. Furthermore, the proposed forecasting approach results in a Mean Absolute Percentage Error of 10% for specific components, with a potential for further reduction, as data availability increases. Finally, the cost optimizer can prescribe spare part acquisition scenarios that yield a 9% overall cost reduction over the span of two years. Originality/value: By adopting the proposed approach, shipping companies have the potential to produce meaningful results ranging from soft benefits, such as the rationalization of the workload of the purchasing department and its third party collaborators to hard, quantitative benefits, such as reducing the cost of the bulk ordering process, directly affecting a company’s bottom line. © 2021, OmniaScience.

"New trends in the management of production costs are associated with the development of Machine learning, taking into account the human factor. They often use a bifurcation procedure that assigns costs to one of two categories. For this, training of pattern recognition is applied. Systems engineering allows for more sophisticated partition learning models that categorize costs into one of four categories (quartering). For this, two bifurcation training models are integrated. Such quartering is used by the management of the company to stimulate personnel responsible for costs. However, if the management is not aware of the minimum costs, undesirable activity of the personnel is possible. In this case, personnel, as an active element, chooses costs so as to maximize own incentives. For this reason, the real costs of the company may be higher than the minimum. Therefore, traditional machine supervised learning algorithms for pattern recognition can be ineffective. To solve this problem in the face of uncertainty, a mechanism has been proposed that includes a procedure for training of quartering with the help of instructions from a trainer, as well as a procedure for stimulating. Sufficient conditions for the synthesis of such a mechanism are found, under which the costs are minimal. The use of this mechanism is illustrated with the example of training of quartering and incentives to reduce the cost of re-equipment of locomotives. © 2020 IEEE.",0,10.1109/SUMMA50634.2020.9280681,"This paper discusses the application of machine learning techniques to manage production costs, focusing on a bifurcation procedure that categorizes costs and integrates training models to enhance cost management.

"Increasing supply chain performance in an uncertain environment is a challenge for every industry, predominantly, healthcare sector. To address such issues, there is an urgent need for healthcare organizations like hospitals to build new capabilities. We suggest using organizational information processing theory (OIPT) as theoretical foundation for developing research model that investigates how healthcare 4.0 technologies (big data analytics, artificial intelligence and blockchain) enhance hospital supply chain processes and thereby the performance. According to our analysis of survey data from around 255 hospital managers in Indian hospitals, the three hospital supply chain processes, viz., operations, innovations, and risk management, and the supply chain performance are significantly impacted by these healthcare 4.0 technologies. Additionally, hospital supply chain operations and innovations partially mediate the association between healthcare 4.0 technologies and performance. We also found, the interaction between healthcare 4.0 technologies and hospital supply chain operations is moderated by type of healthcare organizations (private, and public hospitals). In addition to extending and validating the OIPT in context of digital hospital supply chains, these findings offer healthcare professionals empirical evidence to further maximize the benefits of healthcare 4.0 technologies for sustained hospital supply chain performance and integrate digital supply management into health system development. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.",0,10.1016/j.techfore.2024.123256,"This paper investigates how healthcare 4.0 technologies, including artificial intelligence, enhance supply chain processes and performance in hospitals, using organizational information processing theory as a framework.

"The urge for greater agri-food supply chain efficiency (AFSCE) has been gaining in prominence increasingly, spurred on by escalating logistics costs and advances in industry 4.0 technologies (e.g artificial intelligence AI). The latter significant contributions in logistics have led academics to point their attention more to AI utility in operations management. Drawing on dynamic capability view (DCV) and organizational information-processing theories, this study aims to examine the effect of AI based technologies on reducing wastes and minimizing afri-food supply chain costs, hence increasing organization profitability. It also analyzes how outbound logistics and distribution network efficiency (DNE) (warehousing, transportation, packaging, etc.) mediates the relationship between AI and AFSCE. This research investigates the moderating impact of AI adoption impediments (AIAI) on the mediating correlation between AI, DNE and AFSCE as well. Using Partial Least Square-Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) approach, conceptual model and hypothesis were analyzed and tested with 348 responses collected from executives and managers in the Moroccan agri-food industry.

"Nonconformance (NCR) has long been a subject of research interest for its potential to extrapolate information leading to a more productive environment in construction projects. Despite a variety of traditional attempts, a systematic understanding of how machine learning (ML) approaches can contribute to proactively detecting the severity of NCRs remains limited. This study aims to develop a data-driven ML framework to predict the cost impacts of NCRs (high severity versus low severity) in construction projects. To accomplish this aim, the random forest (RF) algorithm reinforced with a metaheuristic hyperparameter-tuning strategy, namely the gravitational search algorithm (GSA), is adopted for the binary classification problem. Furthermore, this study incorporates the Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) ensuring transparent interpretations into the GSA-RF predictive framework to tackle the inherent black-box nature of the ML rationale. The results reveal that the proposed model detects the severity of NCRs in terms of their cost impact with an overall AUROC value of 0.776 for the preseparated and blinded testing set. This indicates that the proposed model can be used confidently for newly introduced datasets from real-life cases. In addition, the SHAP analysis results emphasized the role of season, inadequate application procedure, and NCR type in detecting the severity of NCRs.

"Purpose: In a volatile agricultural postharvest market, producers require more personalized information about market dynamics for informed decisions on the marketed surplus. However, this adaptive strategy fails to benefit them if the selection of a computational price predictive model to disseminate information on the market outlook is not efficient, and the associated risk of perishability, and storage cost factor are not assumed against the seemingly favourable market behaviour. Consequently, the decision of whether to store or sell at the time of crop harvest is a perennial dilemma to solve. With the intent of addressing this challenge for agricultural producers, the study is focused on designing an agricultural decision support system (ADSS) to suggest a favourable marketing strategy to crop producers. Design/methodology/approach: The present study is guided by an eclectic theoretical perspective from supply chain literature that included agency theory, transaction cost theory, organizational information processing theory and opportunity cost theory in revenue risk management. The paper models a structured iterative algorithmic framework that leverages the forecasting capacity of different time series and machine learning models, considering the effect of influencing factors on agricultural price movement for better forecasting predictability against market variability or dynamics. It also attempts to formulate an integrated risk management framework for effective sales planning decisions that factors in the associated costs of storage, rental and physical loss until the surplus is held for expected returns. Findings: Empirical demonstration of the model was simulated on the dynamic markets of tomatoes, onions and potatoes in a north Indian region. The study results endorse that farmer-centric post-harvest information intelligence assists crop producers in the strategic sales planning of their produce, and also vigorously promotes that the effectiveness of decision making is contingent upon the selection of the best predictive model for every future market event. Practical implications: As a policy implication, the proposed ADSS addresses the pressing need for a robust marketing support system for the socio-economic welfare of farming communities grappling with distress sales, and low remunerative returns. Originality/value: Based on the extant literature studied, there is no such study that pays personalized attention to agricultural producers, enabling them to make a profitable sales decision against the volatile post-harvest market scenario. The present research is an attempt to fill that gap with the scope of addressing crop producer's ubiquitous dilemma of whether to sell or store at the time of harvesting. Besides, an eclectic and iterative style of predictive modelling has also a limited implication in the agricultural supply chain based on the literature; however, it is found to be a more efficient practice to function in a dynamic market outlook. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",0,10.1108/BIJ-12-2021-0780,This study designs an Agricultural Decision Support System (ADSS) to assist crop producers in making informed marketing decisions in a volatile postharvest market.

"Poor visibility of extreme weather (EW)-induced risks and their relationships in the cocoa supply chain induces inefficient risk management and is detrimental to the resilience of the supply chain. On the basis of the resource-based view, emerging technologies can form critical organizational resources to manage these EW-induced risks effectively. Therefore, this article focuses on EW-induced supply chain risks and how artificial intelligence (AI) helps to mitigate them. First, a cognitive mapping approach is used to identify EW-induced risks, their direct links, EW occurrences, and AI capabilities that might mitigate their negative impacts. Second, the best-worst method (BWM) is adopted to rank these EW-induced risks. BWM results suggest that EW-induced risks are prominent in the midstream supply chain, followed by upstream and downstream. EW-induced transportation, farm, and demand risks are the most prevalent of the 11 risk factors, while psychological stress, market share risk, and customer dissatisfaction are the least prominent. This finding reveals that although the EW-induced risks have the greatest impact on local firms, they will be transferred to upstream and downstream firms. Furthermore, a data requirement-based evaluation of AI algorithms and a conceptual framework are developed for a systematic approach to selecting and designing an AI system for managing EW-induced supply chain risks. This study empirically discloses the multilevel relationships between AI capabilities and EW-induced supply chain risks, which can help supply chain professionals effectively manage EW-induced risks through AI.  © 1988-2012 IEEE.",0,10.1109/TEM.2023.3289258,"This paper examines how artificial intelligence can mitigate extreme weather-induced risks in the cocoa supply chain, utilizing cognitive mapping to identify risks and the best-worst method to rank them.

"I apply a novel machine-learning based ""weather index"" method to daily storelevel sales data for a national apparel and sporting goods brand to examine short-run responses to weather and long-run adaptation to climate. I find that even when considering potentially offsetting shifts of sales between outdoor and indoor stores, to the firm's website, or over time, weather has significant persistent effects on sales. This suggests that weather may increase sales volatility as more severe weather shocks become more frequent under climate change. Consistent with adaptation to climate, I find that sensitivity of sales to weather decreases with historical experience for precipitation, snow, and cold weather events, but - surprisingly - not for extreme heat events. This suggests that adaptation may moderate some but not all the adverse impacts of climate change on sales.

"The COVID-19 pandemic-driven financial crisis grew significant interest among firms to adopt supply chain finance (SCF) to optimize working capital for the financial stability of the supply chain. However, it is impractical for firms with a diverse and extensive supplier base to strategize the SCF solutions for individual suppliers by assessing their financial risk.

"It is a goal that manufacturing companies strive towards on a regular basis, and it involves enhancing the efficiency and productivity of maintenance operations. It is especially vital to avoid unforeseen breakdowns, which may result in costly charges and production losses if they do not occur in advance. While the execution of an acceptable management plan affects maintenance productivity, it also affects the adoption of proper procedures and tools to help in the assessment processes in this field. This difficulty, among other things, affects a company's capacity to achieve high performance with the equipment it employs, as well as the judgement process and the design of the firm's maintenance plan. In order to achieve this goal, the aim of this paper is to exemplify how intelligent systems can be used to enhance judgement techniques in the implementation of the lean maintenance perspective, allowing for an advancement in the functional capabilities of the industry's technological infrastructure.

"This study investigates the role of human intervention in artificial intelligence/machine learning (AIML)-driven predictions. By doing so, we distinguish between three different types of human-AIML collaboration: automation, adjustable automation, and augmentation. We theorize that prediction uncertainty and time horizon represent two critical determinants of forecast accuracy.

Our findings show that human intervention complements AIML-driven forecasts most effectively (augmentation) in predictions with long time horizons and low uncertainty. However human intervention is least likely to contribute to the effectiveness of AIML predictions (automation) in environments with short time horizons and high uncertainty.

"Purpose: Failed deliveries (i.e. deliveries not accomplished due to the absence of customers) represent a critical issue in B2C (Business-to-consumer) e-commerce last-mile deliveries, implying high costs for e-commerce players and negatively affecting customer satisfaction. A promising option to reduce them would be scheduling deliveries based on the probability to find customers at home.

"Industries are utilising Artificial Intelligence (AI) and digital technologies to facilitate asset management. Increased implementation of AI and digital technologies requires new concepts to facilitate and simplify the Human- System-Interaction (HSI) in industrial contexts. One of the concepts for improving the HSI is by enabling a multi-space environment that integrates the physical space and the virtual space. Such a multi-space environment, materialised as metaverse, aims to augment the interaction between liveware, software, and hardware. In industry, the concept of metaverse can be used to facilitate various industrial processes, such as asset management, operation, and maintenance. One of the main challenges when enabling a metaverse in industrial contexts is the aspect of visualisation of physical and virtual assets. Asset visualisation can be supported through various emerging technologies such as gaming technology, Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and eXtented Reality (XR). In this paper, the applicability of such advanced technologies i.e., eXtended Reality (XR) have been reviewed for the asset management within various industrial domains. To carry out this research work, literature review has been conducted related to available XR technologies and their applications within the industries. It has been found that these technologies are available, but not applied in industrial asset management.

"Lenovo Research teamed with members of the factory operations group at Lenovo’s largest laptop manufacturing facility, LCFC, to replace a manual production scheduling system with a decision-making platform built on a deep reinforcement learning architecture. The system schedules production orders at all LCFC’s 43 assembly manufacturing lines, balancing the relative priorities of production volume, changeover cost, and order fulfillment. The multiobjective optimization scheduling problem is solved using a deep reinforcement learning model. The approach combines high computing efficiency with a novel masking mechanism that enforces operational constraints to ensure that the machine-learning model does not waste time exploring infeasible solutions. The use of the new model transformed the production management process enabling a 20% reduction in the backlog of production orders and a 23% improvement in the fulfillment rate. It also reduced the entire scheduling process from six hours to 30 minutes while it retained multiobjective flexibility to allow LCFC to adjust quickly to changing objectives.

"Improving airport collaborative decision making is at the heart of airport operations centers (APOCs) recently established in several major European airports. In this paper, we describe a project commissioned by Eurocontrol, the organization in charge of the safety and seamless flow of European air traffic. The project’s goal was to examine the opportunities offered by the colocation and real-time data sharing in the APOC at London’s Heathrow airport, arguably the most advanced of its type in Europe. We developed and implemented a pilot study of a real-time data-sharing and collaborative decision-making process, selected to improve the efficiency of Heathrow’s operations. In this paper, we describe the process of how we chose the subject of the pilot, namely the improvement of transfer-passenger flows through the airport, and how we helped Heathrow move from its existing legacy system for managing passenger flows to an advanced machine learning–based approach using real-time inputs. The system, which is now in operation at Heathrow, can predict which passengers are likely to miss their connecting flights, reducing the likelihood that departures will incur delays while waiting for delayed passengers. This can be done by off-loading passengers in advance, by expediting passengers through the airport, or by modifying the departure times of aircraft in advance. By aggregating estimated passenger arrival time at various points throughout the airport, the system also improves passenger experiences at the immigration and security desks by enabling modifications to staffing levels in advance of expected surges in arrivals. The nine-stage framework we present here can support the development and implementation of other real-time, data-driven systems.

"Due to fast-paced technical development, companies are forced to modernise and update their equipment, as well as production planning methods. In the ordering process, the customer is interested not only in product specifications, but also in the manufacturing lead time by which the product will be completed. Therefore, companies strive towards setting an appealing but attainable manufacturing lead date. Manufacturing lead time depends on many different factors; therefore, it is difficult to predict. Estimation of manufacturing lead time is usually based on previous experience. In the following research, manufacturing lead time for tools for aluminium extrusion was estimated with Artificial Intelligence, more precisely, with Neural Networks.

We conceptualize an entirely different approach to analyzing the risk profiles of supplier performance under uncertainty by utilizing the data analytics capabilities in digital manufacturing. Digital manufacturing peculiarly challenge the supplier selection by the dynamic order allocations, and opens new opportunities to exploit the digital data to improve sourcing decisions. We develop a hybrid technique, combining simulation and machine learning and examine its applications to data-driven decision-making support in resilient supplier selection. We consider on-time delivery as an indicator for supplier reliability, and explore the conditions surrounding the formation of resilient supply performance profiles. We theorize the notions of risk profile of supplier performance and resilient supply chain performance. We show that the associations of the deviations from the resilient supply chain performance profile with the risk profiles of supplier performance can be efficiently deciphered by our approach.

"The growing importance of humanitarian operations has created an imperative to overcome the complications currently recorded in the field. Challenges such as delays, congestion, poor communication and lack of accountability may represent opportunities to test the reported advantages of emergent disruptive technologies. Meanwhile, the literature on humanitarian supply chains looks at isolated applications of technology and lacks a framework for understanding challenges and solutions, a gap that this article aims to fill. Using a case study based on the flood of Tabasco of 2007 in Mexico, this research identifies solutions based on the use of emergent disruptive technologies. Furthermore, this article argues that the integration of different technologies is essential to deliver real benefits to the humanitarian supply chain. As a result, it proposes a framework to improve the flow of information, products and financial resources in humanitarian supply chains integrating three emergent disruptive technologies; Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain and 3D Printing.

"Purpose: An emerging theme in the practitioner literature suggests that the supply chain of the future – enabled especially by developments in ICT – will be autonomous and have predictive capabilities, bringing significant efficiency gains in an increasingly complex and uncertain environment. This paper aims to both bridge the gap between the practitioner and academic literature on these topics and contribute to both practice and theory by seeking to understand how such developments will help to address key supply chain challenges and opportunities. Design/methodology/approach: A multi-disciplinary, systematic literature review was conducted on relevant concepts and capabilities. A total of 126 articles were reviewed covering the time period 1950-2018. Findings: The results show that both IoT and AI are the technologies most frequently associated with the anticipated autonomous and predictive capabilities of future supply chains. In addition, the review highlights a lacuna in how such technologies and capabilities help address key supply chain challenges and opportunities.

"Purpose: COVID-19 has pushed many supply chains to re-think and strengthen their resilience and how it can help organisations survive in difficult times. Considering the availability of data and the huge number of supply chains that had their weak links exposed during COVID-19, the objective of the study is to employ artificial intelligence to develop supply chain resilience to withstand extreme disruptions such as COVID-19. Design/methodology/approach: We adopted a qualitative approach for interviewing respondents using a semi-structured interview schedule through the lens of organisational information processing theory. A total of 31 respondents from the supply chain and information systems field shared their views on employing artificial intelligence (AI) for supply chain resilience during COVID-19. We used a process of open, axial and selective coding to extract interrelated themes and proposals that resulted in the establishment of our framework. Findings: An AI-facilitated supply chain helps systematically develop resilience in its structure and network. Resilient supply chains in dynamic settings and during extreme disruption scenarios are capable of recognising (sensing risks, degree of localisation, failure modes and data trends), analysing (what-if scenarios, realistic customer demand, stress test simulation and constraints), reconfiguring (automation, re-alignment of a network, tracking effort, physical security threats and control) and activating (establishing operating rules, contingency management, managing demand volatility and mitigating supply chain shock) operations quickly.

"This research contributes to the debate about the relevance of Industry 4.0 technologies in improving environmental performance in the manufacturing industry. We employed a qualitative–quantitative approach in which 19 Italian operations managers were interviewed and 260 managers responded to an online questionnaire. The effects of various technologies were ranked using ordinal regression. Comments and suggestions gave context to the quantitative results. Sensors, radio-frequency identification, artificial intelligence and analytics were found to be most relevant in improving environmental performance, whereas simulation software contributed moderately. Additive manufacturing, cobots, robots, automated mobile robots and automated guided vehicles had a negative effect, augmented reality had no effect and other technologies indirectly affected environmental performance. We also found a lack of knowledge and application as well as scepticism about technologies such as artificial intelligence and augmented reality.

"Digitalization of the supply chain (SC) has received plenty of attention from practitioners and researchers in recent years to address the challenges of the business environment and assist firms in achieving a circular SC. Implementing circularity in business operations is a practice of achieving sustainability which is of utmost significance for achieving sustainable development goals established by the United Nations. This study empirically examines the relation among flexibility, AI–IoT adoption, and SC firm performance under the circular economy (CE) environment based on resource orchestration theory (ROT), an integrated version of the extended-resource-based view, and dynamic capability theory (DCT). Data were collected from Indian manufacturing firms through a questionnaire-based survey and examined using “structural equation modeling (SEM).” The study results show that information flexibility and organizational flexibility have the highest impact on AI–IoT adoption. Organizational flexibility shows full mediation with AI–IoT, which would influence the SC firm performance directly. The analysis also indicates that CE will affect the relation between organizational flexibility and AI–IoT adoption.

"The Industry 4.0 (I4.0) revolution has led to rapid digital transformation, automation of manufacturing processes and efficient decision-making in business operations. Despite the potential benefits of I4.0 technologies in operations management reported in the extant literature, there has been a paucity of empirical research examining the intention to adopt I4.0 technologies for managing risks. Risk management identifies, assesses, and introduces responses for risks to avert crises. This study combines institutional theory, the resource-based view and the technology acceptance model to develop a novel behavioural model examining the adoption of big data, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and blockchain for risk management from the operations manager's perspective, which has never been examined in the literature. The model was tested for each I4.0 technology using data collected from 117 operations managers in the UK manufacturing industry which were analysed using structural equation modelling.

"Purpose: The research study aims to investigate green supply chain management (GSCM) elements as part of a complete system. It aims to understand the special properties of the GSCM system under the moderating effects of product complexity and purchasing structure. Design/methodology/approach: A thorough literature review led to the building of the conceptual framework. Six constructs were identified using systems theory. These constructs include green supply chain technological dimensions (particularly, Artificial Intelligence (AI) based), green supply chain strategy, green supply chain process, product complexity, purchasing structure, and firm performance. The instrument was scientifically developed for gathering survey responses using complete design test methods. The conceptual model was eventually tested based on survey data collected from 250 automotive components and allied manufacturers in the emerging economy of South Africa. Findings: The results indicate that GSCM technological dimensions (AI-based) positively influence GSCM strategy. Further, GSCM strategy was found to positively influence the GSCM process. The GSCM processes have significant effects on environmental performance, social performance, and financial performance. The product complexity has a significant moderation effect on the paths GSCM strategy and GSCM process.

"While the circular economy (CE) attracts attention from scholars and practitioners, the concept has been challenged by claims that the CE may be seen as a vague concept, or a new label for old green management practices. We propose a new approach to study the effects of the CE on company performance: circular product design (CPD). Consequently, this work investigates how Industry 4.0 technologies and stakeholder pressure influence CPD and, in turn, impact on company performance. Data were obtained from firms which develop products in the electric–electronic and equipment (EEE) sectors in Brazil. Our research results indicate that (i) the application of Industry 4.0 technologies favors CPD, in particular artificial intelligence and big data analytics; (ii) pressure from stakeholders can encourage the adoption of circular strategies, specially from suppliers because they are responsible for developing and delivering smart components; and (iii) although the literature may be seen as controversial, there is a positive relationship with regard to the impacts of CE adoption on market performance.

"Purpose: This paper compares impact of Industry 4.0 / emerging information and communication Technologies (ICTs), for example, Internet of things (IOT), machine learning, artificial intelligence (AI), robotics and cloud computing, on 22 organisational performance indicators under nine combinations of Lean Six Sigma (LSS) and quality management systems (QMS). Design/methodology/approach: Survey of 105 Indian organisations was done about their experience of using QMS, Lean Six Sigma and emerging ICTs. Respondents included both manufacturing and service enterprises of different scales and sectors. The responses collected were compared, and statistically significant difference among them was evaluated using chi-square test. Findings: The study confirmed statistically significant difference among 20 organisational performance indicators under different combinations of QMS, LSS and ICTs. These indicators include quality performance, delivery performance, sales turnover, inventory level and so forth. However, for two indicators, namely, absenteeism and throughput, significant difference in responses was not established. Research limitations/implications: All possible combinations of QMS, LSS, only LSS tools and ICTs were not studied because of either theoretical impossibility (e.g. using LSS without LSS tools) or practically rare situations (e.g. organisations using ICTs and LSS without QMS). Furthermore, the impact from different sequences of implementing QMS, LSS and ICTs can be studied.

"The ability of project managers to make reliable cash flow predictions enhances project cost flow control and management. Reliable cash flow prediction over the course of a construction project puts the project manager in a better position to identify potential problems and develop appropriate strategies to mitigate the negative effects of such on overall project success. Therefore, managers should monitor project progress using cash flow data, which has unique characteristics, as time series data. However, the complex, mutable nature of construction projects currently requires significant reliance on experience and expert opinions to predict cash flow on an ongoing basis. Recent studies have indicated good potential for using artificial intelligence to reduce reliance on human input in cash flow prediction processes. The Evolutionary Fuzzy Support Vector Machine Inference Model for Time Series Data (EFSIMT), an artificial intelligence hybrid system focusing on the management of time series data characteristics which fuses fuzzy logic (FL), weighted support vector machines (weighted SVMs) and a fast messy genetic algorithm (fmGA), represents a promising alternative approach to predicting cash flow.

"With the rise of cruise services, energy consumption and emission of the maritime area are increasing. Due to the negative effect of greenhouse gases, many policies have been issued in the world to save energy and reduce emission. Adhering to the principle of energy conservation and emission reduction, an artificial neural network model with strong nonlinear fitting ability is introduced to explore the dynamic sailing data, and predict the fuel consumption for cruise ships based on automatic identification system data. Considering the constraints of station arrival time and the uncertainty of sailing speed and load during sailing, which can obtain the change rule from the historical voyage data, the objective function is to minimize the fuel consumption of a voyage. The established artificial neural network model is embedded into these four improved particle swarm optimization algorithms (GPSO, LPSO, MCPSO and SIPSO) with global search capability to optimize the sailing speed between stations, achieving the economic and environmental protection of a voyage. This method is applied to a real case study of Norwegian waters. By comparing the optimization results of these four algorithms, the total fuel consumption is potential to reduce from 97.4 t to 86.6 t of a voyage with the help of multi-swarm cooperative particle swarm optimization algorithm when its inertia weight is 0.7. It demonstrates that the method can be used as a tool to plan the sailing speed of cruise ships in advance. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",0,10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.01.032,"This paper presents an artificial neural network model to predict fuel consumption for cruise ships using dynamic sailing data, aiming to minimize fuel usage while considering various constraints.

We answer this question by providing a brief review of the evolution of technologies and operations management (OM) over time. Because terms such as “Industry 4.0” do not have a precise definition, we focus on more fundamental issues raised by Industry 4.0 emerging technologies for research in OM. We propose a theory of disruptive debottlenecking and the SACE framework by classifying emerging technologies in terms of the functionalities they enable: sense, analyze, collaborate, and execute. Subsequently, we review the nascent but rapidly growing literature at the interface between digital technologies and OM.

"We develop a data-driven decision model to improve process quality in manufacturing. A challenge for traditional methods in quality management is to handle high-dimensional and nonlinear manufacturing data. We address this challenge by adapting explainable artificial intelligence to the context of quality management. Specifically, we propose the use of nonlinear modeling with Shapley additive explanations to infer how a set of production parameters and the process quality of a manufacturing system are related. Thereby, we contribute a measure of process importance based on which manufacturers can prioritize processes for quality improvement. Grounded in quality management theory, our decision model selects improvement actions that target the sources of quality variation. The decision model is validated in a real-world application at a leading manufacturer of high-power semiconductors. Seeking to improve production yield, we apply our decision model to select improvement actions for a transistor chip product. We then conduct a field experiment to confirm the effectiveness of the improvement actions. Compared with the average yield in our sample, the experiment returns a reduction in yield loss of 21.7%. Furthermore, we report on results from a postexperimental rollout of the decision model, which also resulted in significant yield improvements.

For use in this considerably large service management industry, this article provides verification in the application of decision tree-based machine learning algorithms for optimal maintenance decision-making. The motivation for this research arose from discussions held with a large agricultural equipment manufacturing company interested in increasing the uptime of their expensive machinery and in helping their dealer network. Design/methodology/approach: We propose a general strategy for the design of predictive maintenance systems using machine learning techniques. Then, we present a case study where multiple machine learning algorithms are applied to a particular example situation for an illustration of the proposed strategy and evaluation of its performance. Findings: We found progressive improvements using such machine learning techniques in terms of accuracy in predictions of failure, demonstrating that the proposed strategy is successful. Research limitations/implications: This approach is scalable to a wide variety of applications to aid in failure prediction.

"The product-service system (PSS) business model has received increasing attention in equipment maintenance studies, as it has the potential to provide high value-added services for equipment users and construct ethical principles for equipment providers to support the implementation of circular economy. However, the PSS providers in equipment industry are facing many challenges when implementing Industry 4.0 technologies. One important challenge is how to fully collect and analyse the operational data of different equipment and diverse users in widely varied conditions to make the PSS providers create innovative equipment management services for their customers. To address this challenge, an active preventive maintenance approach for complex equipment is proposed. Firstly, a novel PSS operation mode was developed, where complex equipment is offered as a part of PSS and under exclusive control by the providers. Then, a solution of equipment preventive maintenance based on the operation mode was designed. A deep neural network was trained to predict the remaining effective life of the key components and thereby, it can pre-emptively assess the health status of equipment. Finally, a real-world industrial case of a leading CNC machine provider was developed to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach. Higher accuracy for predicting the remaining effective life was achieved, which resulted in predictive identification of the fault features, proactive implementation of the preventive maintenance, and reduction of the PSS providers’ maintenance costs and resource consumption.

"This paper presents a machine learning assisted computational workflow to optimize a CO2-WAG project considering both hydrocarbon recovery and CO2 sequestration efficacies. A compositional field-scaled numerical simulation model is structured to investigate the fluid flow dynamics of an on-going CO2-EOR project in the Farnsworth Unit (Texas, US). Artificial-neural-network (ANN) based proxy models are trained to predict time-series project responses including hydrocarbon production, CO2 storage and reservoir pressure data. The outputs of the proxy model not only serve for evaluating the objective function but also provide significant physical and economic constraints to the optimization processes. In this work, the objective function considers both the oil recovery and CO2 sequestration volume. Moreover, the project net present values (NPV) and reservoir pressure are employed to screen the optimum solutions. The proposed optimization workflow couples the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm and the ANN proxies to maximize the prescribed objective function. The results of this work indicate that the presented workflow is a more robust approach to co-optimize the CO2-EOR projects. Results show that the optimized case can store about 94% of the purchased CO2 within Farnsworth Unit. Comparing to the baseline case, the CO2 storage amount of the found optimal case increases by 21.69%, and the oil production improves 8.74%. More importantly, the improvements in CO2 storage and hydrocarbon recovery lead to 8.74% greater project NPV and 19.79% higher overall objective function value, which confirms the success of the developed co-optimization approach for CO2 sequestration and oil recovery.

"Problem definition: The beer game is widely used in supply chain management classes to demonstrate the bullwhip effect and the importance of supply chain coordination. The game is a decentralized, multiagent, cooperative problem that can be modeled as a serial supply chain network in which agents choose order quantities while cooperatively attempting to minimize the network's total cost, although each agent only observes local information. Academic/practical relevance: Under some conditions, a base-stock replenishment policy is optimal. However, in a decentralized supply chain in which some agents act irrationally, there is no known optimal policy for an agent wishing to act optimally. Methodology: We propose a deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to play the beer game. Our algorithm makes no assumptions about costs or other settings. As with any deep RL algorithm, training is computationally intensive, but once trained, the algorithm executes in real time. We propose a transfer-learning approach so that training performed for one agent can be adapted quickly for other agents and settings. Results: When playing with teammates who follow a base-stock policy, our algorithm obtains near-optimal order quantities. More important, it performs significantly better than a base-stock policy when other agents use a more realistic model of human ordering behavior. We observe similar results using a real-world data set. Sensitivity analysis shows that a trained model is robust to changes in the cost coefficients. Finally, applying transfer learning reduces the training time by one order of magnitude. Managerial implications: This paper shows how artificial intelligence can be applied to inventory optimization. Our approach can be extended to other supply chain optimization problems, especially those in which supply chain partners act in irrational or unpredictable ways.

"The challenging situations and disruptions that occurred due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic have created a severe need for supply chain resiliency (SCR). There has been a growing interest among researchers to investigate the resiliency in supply chain operations to overcome risks and disruptions and to achieve successful project management. The supply chain of every business requires innovative projects to accomplish competitive advantage in the market. This study was conducted to identify the significance of artificial intelligence (AI) for creating a sustainable and resilient supply chain, and also to provide optimum solutions for supply chain risk mitigation. A systematic literature review has been conducted to examine the potential research contribution or directions in the field of AI and SCR. In total, 162 articles were shortlisted from the SCOPUS database in the chosen field of research. Structural Topic Modeling (STM), a big data-based approach, was employed to generate several thematic topics of AI in SCR based on the shortlisted articles, and all topics were discussed. Furthermore, the bibliometric analysis was conducted using R-package to investigate the research trends in the area of AI in SCR. Based on the conducted review of literature, a research framework was proposed for AI in SCR that will facilitate researchers and practitioners to improve technological development in supply chain firms. The purpose is to combat sudden risks and disruptions so that project management will perform well Post COVID-19. The study will be also helpful for future researchers and practitioners to identify research directions based on existing literature covered in this paper in the field of SCR. Future research directions are proposed for AI-enabled resilient supply chain management.

"The construction industry is one of the world's most labor-intensive industries. In it, workers are challenged almost every day by highly demanding physical tasks. Although current methods [e.g., the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)] to investigate the physical demands of various tasks provide valuable information with which to evaluate certain manual handling tasks, they may be limited to consideration of unique characteristics of each individual (e.g., physiological characteristics) and environmental conditions (e.g., ambient temperature and humidity). In other words, given the same task, different workers experience different levels of exertion. To address this problem, the objective of this research is to develop a procedure for automatic predictions of demand levels based on physiological signals collected from workers. To achieve the objective, workers' physiological signals were captured using a wristband-type biosensor while they performed regular tasks in the field. Various physiological responses were extracted from the artifact-corrected physiological signals. The rate of energy expenditure, estimated using an energy-expenditure prediction program (EEPP), was used as a baseline to separate tasks into low-, moderate-, and high-intensity activities. Then, a supervised-machine-learning model was trained by applying a Gaussian kernel support vector machine. The results led to a prediction accuracy of 90% in recognizing low and high physical-intensity levels and 87% for low, moderate, and high physical-intensity levels. The main contribution to the body of knowledge is the development of an automatic and noninvasive method for assessing workers' physical demands in the field. This study will contribute to improving construction workers' productivity, safety, and general well-being through the early detection of highly physically demanding tasks in the field. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.",0,10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001710,"This research develops an automatic procedure to predict physical demand levels in construction workers using physiological signals collected via biosensors.

"Food production is a complex process where uncertainty is very relevant (e.g. stochastic yield and demand, variability in raw materials and ingredients…), resulting in differences between planned production and actual output. These discrepancies have an economic cost for the company (e.g. waste disposal), as well as an environmental impact (food waste and increased carbon footprint). This research aims to develop tools based on data analytics to predict the magnitude of these discrepancies, improving enterprise profitability while, at the same time, reducing environmental impact aiding food waste management. A food company that produces liquid products based on fruits and vegetables was analyzed. Data was gathered on 1,795 batches, including the characteristics of the product (recipe, components used…) and the difference between the input and the output weight. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms were used to predict deviations in production, reducing uncertainties related to the amount of waste produced. The ML models had greater predictive capacity than a linear model with stepwise parameter selection. Then, uncertainty is included in the predictions using a normal distribution based on the residuals of the model. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that ML models can be used as a tool to identify possible production anomalies. This research shows innovative ways to deal with uncertainty in production planning using modern methods in the field of operation research. These tools improve classical methods and provide production managers with valuable information to assess the economic benefits of improved machinery or process controls. As a consequence, accurate predictive models can potentially improve the profitability of food companies, also reducing their environmental impact. © 2020 The Authors",0,10.1016/j.orp.2020.100147,"This research develops data analytics tools using machine learning to predict discrepancies in food production, aiming to enhance profitability and reduce environmental impact.

"Human–computer interaction (HCI) is a cornerstone for the success of technical innovation in the logistics and supply chain sector. As a major part of social sustainability, this interaction is changing as artificial intelligence applications (Internet of Things, autonomous transport, Physical Internet) are implemented, leading to larger machine autonomy, and hence the transition from a primary executive to a supervisory role of human operators. A fundamental question concerns the level of control transferred to machines, such as autonomous vehicles and automatic materials handling devices. Problems include a lack of human trust toward automatic decision making or an inclination to override the system in case automated decisions are misperceived. This paper outlines a theoretical framework, describing different levels of acceptance and trust as a key HCI element of technology innovation, and points to the possible danger of an artificial divide at both the individual and firm level. Based upon the findings of four benchmark cases, a classification of the roles of human employees in adopting innovations is developed. Measures at operational, tactical, and strategic level are discussed to improve HCI, more in particular the capacity of individuals and firms to apply state-of-the-art techniques and to prevent an artificial divide, thereby increasing social sustainability. © 2019 Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals",0,10.1111/jbl.12198,"This paper examines the role of human-computer interaction (HCI) in the logistics and supply chain sector, particularly in the context of AI applications and their impact on human roles and trust in automated systems.

"The construction industry has been influenced considerably by smart technologies in the last decade, ushered in by the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Smart technologies display the potential to improve the performance of the construction industry. Due to the increasingly complex projects and urgent labor shortage caused by the pandemic, it is important for the industry to have a holistic understanding of the specific applications of smart technologies in construction project management. However, there is limited research on the applications of smart technologies with a focus on project management knowledge areas. Therefore, this paper aims to (1) investigate the applications of smart technologies on project time, cost, and quality management and identify the top influential applications; and (2) identify whether the organizations' profiles influence project managers' perceptions of smart technologies. In order to achieve these objectives, a literature review was first conducted to establish a comprehensive list of applications. Then, a survey questionnaire was designed and disseminated to investigate the most influential applications. Finally, a post interview was conducted to validate the survey results. The study identified 24 applications of cyber-physical systems, big data, artificial intelligence, and smart robotics on project time, cost, and quality management, and found that the most influential applications of smart technologies are data collection for progress tracking, real-time monitoring, and schedule estimation. Furthermore, in most cases, organizations with different sizes and years of experience make no difference in respondents' perceived impact of applications. The findings from this study contribute to the Project Management Body of Knowledge by informing how smart technologies can improve project management processes and performance.

"Purpose - Quality management of products is an important part of manufacturing process. One way to manage and assure product quality is to use machine learning algorithms based on relationship among various process steps. The purpose of this paper is to integrate manufacturing, inspection and after-sales service data to make full use of machine learning algorithms for estimating the products' quality in a supervised fashion. Proposed frameworks and methods are applied to actual data associated with heavy machinery engines. Design/methodology/approach - By following Lenzerini's formula, manufacturing, inspection and aftersales service data from various sources are integrated. The after-sales service data are used to label each engine as normal or abnormal. In this study, one-class classification algorithms are used due to class imbalance problem. To address multi-dimensionality of time series data, the symbolic aggregate approximation algorithm is used for data segmentation. Then, binary genetic algorithm-based wrapper approach is applied to segmented data to find the optimal feature subset. Findings - By employing machine learning-based anomaly detection models, an anomaly score for each engine is calculated. Experimental results show that the proposed method can detect defective engines with a high probability before they are shipped. Originality/value - Through data integration, the actual customer-perceived quality from after-sales service is linked to data from manufacturing and inspection process.

"Although the global green supply chain management (GSCM) practice has attracted considerable scholarly attention, its efficacy for environmental management systems (EMS) and market competitiveness during Covid-19 has not been fully capitalized. Therefore, the existing literature indicates that the important link between GSCM, EMS, and market competitiveness is missing as supply management is crucial to maintaining market competitiveness. To fill this research gap, the current study examines whether EMS affects the relationship between GSCM practices and market competitiveness. We also propose the moderating role of big data analytics and artificial intelligence (BDA-AI) and environmental visibility on these associations from a Covid-19 perspective. We tested a proposed model using the primary data (N = 283) from regression-based structural equation modeling (SEM). The results provide empirical support for the impact of GSCM on ESM and market competitiveness. Furthermore, the results show that BDA-AI and environmental visibility strengthen the positive relationship between GSCM-EMS and EMS and market competitiveness, respectively.

"Purpose: As focal firms in supply networks reflect on their experiences of the pandemic and begin to rethink their operations and supply chains, there is a significant opportunity to leverage digital technological advances to enhance socially responsible operations performance (SROP). This paper develops a novel framework for exploring the adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies for improving SROP. It highlights current best-practice examples and presents future research pathways. Design/methodology/approach: This viewpoint paper argues how Industry 4.0 technology adoption can enable effective SROP in the post-COVID-19 era. Academic articles, relevant grey literature, and insights from industry experts are used to support the development of the framework. Findings: Seven technologies are identified that bring transformational capabilities to SROP, i.e. big data analytics, digital twins, augmented reality, blockchain, 3D printing, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things. It is demonstrated how these technologies can help to improve three sub-themes of organisational social performance (employment practices, health and safety, and business practices) and three sub-themes of community social performance (quality of life and social welfare, social governance, and economic welfare and growth). Research limitations/implications: A research agenda is outlined at the intersection of Industry 4.0 and SROP through the six sub-themes of organisational and community social performance. Further, these are connected through three overarching research agendas: “Trust through Technology”, “Responsible Relationships” and “Freedom through Flexibility”. Practical implications: Organisational agendas for Industry 4.0 and social responsibility can be complementary. The framework provides insights into how Industry 4.0 technologies can help firms achieve long-term post-COVID-19 recovery, with an emphasis on SROP. This can offer firms competitive advantage in the “new normal” by helping them build back better. Social implications: People and communities should be at the heart of decisions about rethinking operations and supply chains.

"Background: In hereby article authors try to summarize how AI can be use by companies within production and warehousing. On the basis of previously developed Logistics 4.0 maturity model authors also propose Artificial intelligence maturity levels and on its basis a survey has been conducted in selected Polish and Norwegian companies and actual AI state of development and maturity levels has been recognized. However authors present preliminary stage of research as a multi case study which will be further developed and extended in order to identify branches and areas with a hugest potential to enhance AI utilization. Furthermore paper presents potential directions of Artificial intelligence implementation as well as tools that can be useful to deal with big data and optimization problems predicted not only for big companies but also SMEs. Authors propose term Artificial Intelligence 4.0 to point out the actual trends in the scope of Industry 4.0 and Logistics 4.0 and revolution with respect to AI. Without doubt AI is a big challenge for manufacturing companies as well as Transport and Logistics Industry and its application should be increased and extended in solving practical problems. Methods: Methodology applied by authors of hereby paper can be divided on following stages: literature analysis, enlargement of AI maturity model, development of a questionnaire, multi-case studies in Norway and Poland. Results: The literature search showed a cognitive gap due to fact there is a little of literature dealing with problem of Artificial intelligence maturity models as well as Logistics 4.0 and Artificial Intelligence. Artificial intelligence maturity levels can be combined with Logistics 4.0 maturity models thus relations between actual level of logistics maturity and AI readiness in companies will be recognized.

"Purpose: Over the years, technology development has rationalized supply chain processes. The demand economy is disrupting every sector causing the supply chain to be more innovative than ever before. The digitalization of the supply chain fulfils this demand. Several technologies such as blockchain, big data analytics, 3D printing, Internet of things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), augmented reality (AR), etc. have been innovated in recent years, which expedite the digitalization of the supply chain. The paper aims to analyse the applicability of these technological enablers in the digital transformation of the supply chain and to present an interpretive structural modelling (ISM) model, which presents a sequence in which enablers can be implemented in a sequential manner. Design/methodology/approach: This paper employed the ISM approach to propose a various levelled model for the enablers of the digital supply chain.

"Purpose: Cement as one of the major components of construction activities, releases a tremendous amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere, resulting in adverse environmental impacts and high energy consumption. Increasing demand for CO2 consumption has urged construction companies and decision-makers to consider ecological efficiency affected by CO2 consumption. Therefore, this paper aims to develop a method capable of analyzing and assessing the eco-efficiency determining factor in Iran’s 22 local cement companies over 2015–2019. Design/methodology/approach: This research uses two well-known artificial intelligence approaches, namely, optimization data envelopment analysis (DEA) and machine learning algorithms at the first and second steps, respectively, to fulfill the research aim. Meanwhile, to find the superior model, the CCR model, BBC model and additive DEA models to measure the efficiency of decision processes are used. A proportional decreasing or increasing of inputs/outputs is the main concern in measuring efficiency which neglect slacks, and hence, is a critical limitation of radial models. Thus, the additive model by considering desirable and undesirable outputs, as a well-known DEA non-proportional and non-radial model, is used to solve the problem. Additive models measure efficiency via slack variables. Considering both input-oriented and output-oriented is one of the main advantages of the additive model. Findings: After applying the proposed model, the Malmquist productivity index is computed to evaluate the productivity of companies over 2015–2019. Although DEA is an appreciated method for evaluating, it fails to extract unknown information. Thus, machine learning algorithms play an important role in this step. Association rules are used to extract hidden rules and to introduce the three strongest rules. Finally, three data mining classification algorithms in three different tools have been applied to introduce the superior algorithm and tool. A new converting two-stage to single-stage model is proposed to obtain the eco-efficiency of the whole system. This model is proposed to fix the efficiency of a two-stage process and prevent the dependency on various weights. Converting undesirable outputs and desirable inputs to final desirable inputs in a single-stage model to minimize inputs, as well as turning desirable outputs to final desirable outputs in the single-stage model to maximize outputs to have a positive effect on the efficiency of the whole process. Originality/value: The performance of the proposed approach provides us with a chance to recognize pattern recognition of the whole, combining DEA and data mining techniques during the selected period (five years from 2015 to 2019). Meanwhile, the cement industry is one of the foremost manufacturers of naturally harmful material using an undesirable by-product; specific stress is given to that pollution control investment or undesirable output while evaluating energy use efficiency.

"Recent advancements and developments in artificial intelligence (AI) based approaches have shifted the manufacturing practices towards the fourth industrial revolution, considered as Industry 4.0 practices. A positive impact of AI-based techniques on sustainability can be seen in manufacturing organisations’ at the system, product and process levels. Adopting AI-based strategies in manufacturing improves decision making, productivity and system performance. Despite sustainability and other benefits, the adoption of AI-based approaches in manufacturing organisations is still limited due to employees’ knowledge and digital skills. In the present time, due to the digitalisation of manufacturing activities, intelligent sensors, and supply chain activities, industries are facing challenges with the generation of high volume, different variety and velocity of data. This data can be helpful for manufacturing organisations to enhance their performance and sustainability. However, managing this big data is still a significant challenge due to a lack of knowledge and limited literature. Deep learning (DL) based models can be a suitable choice to provide advanced analytics tools for manufacturing data processing and analysis. However, literature on the DL is still limited in the manufacturing context with its relationship to sustainability. The present study discusses the evolution of DL approaches in manufacturing and different DL-based models. This study also highlights how DL-based approaches can enhance the sustainability performance of industries.

"It is important to manage operational disruptions to ensure the success of supply chain operations. To achieve this aim, researchers have developed techniques that determine the occurrence of operational risk events which assists supply chain operational risk managers develop plans to manage them by detection/monitoring, mitigation/management, or optimization techniques. Various artificial intelligence (AI) approaches have been used to develop such techniques in the broad activities of operational risk management. However, all of these techniques are black box in their working nature. This means that the chosen technique cannot explain why it has given that output and whether it is correct and free from bias. To address this, researchers argue the need for supply chain management professionals to move towards using explainable AI methods for operational risk management. In this paper, we conduct a systematic literature review on the techniques used to determine operational risks and analyse whether they satisfy the requirement of them being explainable. The findings highlight the shortcomings and inspires directions for future research. From a managerial perspective, the paper encourages risk managers to choose techniques for supply chain operational risk management that can be auditable as this will ensure that the risk managers know why they should take a particular risk management action rather than just what they should do to manage the operational risks. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",0,10.1016/j.knosys.2021.107587,"This paper conducts a systematic literature review on AI techniques used in operational risk management within supply chains, focusing on the need for explainable AI methods to enhance understanding and reduce bias.

"Actionable Cognitive Twins are the next generation Digital Twins enhanced with cognitive capabilities through a knowledge graph and artificial intelligence models that provide insights and decision-making options to the users. The knowledge graph describes the domain-specific knowledge regarding entities and interrelationships related to a manufacturing setting. It also contains information on possible decision-making options that can assist decision-makers, such as planners or logisticians. This paper proposes a knowledge graph modelling approach to construct actionable cognitive twins for capturing specific knowledge related to production planning and demand forecasting in a manufacturing plant. The knowledge graph provides semantic descriptions and contextualisation of the production lines and processes, including data identification and simulation or artificial intelligence algorithms and forecasts used to support them. Such semantics provide ground for inferencing, relating different knowledge types: creative, deductive, definitional, and inductive. To develop the knowledge graph models for describing the use case thoroughly, systems thinking approach is proposed to design and verify the ontology, develop a knowledge graph and build an actionable cognitive twin.

"Inspired by the fourth industrial revolution (4IR) and digital transformation (DT), the Internet-of-Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) have become valuable tools in the oil/gas industry. DT in oil/gas requires the marrying of physical technologies, such as smart sensors, and digital technologies, such as AI, edge computing/cloud-based platforms, which forms the basis for the IoT. The overall strategy for achieving DT in the drilling sector is to set a clear direction for change by not only requiring communication and coordination between the research and development (RD) units but also aligning with drilling engineering/operational stakeholder requirements. Drilling organizations stand to benefit from DT since a set of interlinked technologies, such as IoT, is not simply concerned with the cost savings due to its implementation, but more with the tremendous potential these technologies have in the future to significantly increase revenue generation efficiency and profits by performing tasks differently across a traditional industry such as drilling; laying platforms for integrating future technologies, and the ability to seamlessly connect and coordinate across silos. Implementing IoT has the potential to increase operational drilling efficiency by 5% and cut upstream operating expenditure by 20%-30%; both significant values in a multibillion-dollar industry. Moreover, the economic value creation in the oil/gas industry in the next seven years is projected to be trillions of dollars, and analysts at Nomura, a large Japanese financial holding company, believe the IoT could make oil/gas companies more profitable at 70/barrel than they were previously at 100/barrel.  © 1973-2011 IEEE.",0,10.1109/EMR.2020.2999420,"This paper discusses the integration of IoT and AI in the oil and gas industry, emphasizing their role in digital transformation and operational efficiency in drilling.

"In competitive bidding in the United States, the lowest bid is frequently selected to perform the project. However, the lowest bidder may incur significant cost increases through change orders. For project owners to accurately estimate the actual project cost and to predict the bid that is close to the actual project cost, there is a need for new decision aids to analyze the bid patterns. In this paper, two neural network models, a classification model and a general regression model, were used as a method of selecting the bidder that submits the bid closest to the actual project cost. The empirical results suggest that for selected projects these models selected the bids that are closer to the actual project costs than the lowest bid.

"This paper presents the use of machine learning via a multiple linear regression and a neural network to solve the complex problem of optimizing completions and well designs in the Duvernay shale. Solutions were revealed that could save over a million dollars per well, along with the potential for more than 50% improvement in well performance. This was accomplished through a workflow that rigorously analyzed the relationships between a multitude of well completion variables, generated predictions of future results, and performed optimizations for ideal outcomes. Most importantly, this workflow is not Duvernay specific, and can easily be applied to other basins and formations. This is a fundamental problem in many industries, in that a responding variable is controlled not just by one predictor variable, but by a number of predictor variables. Inferring the relationship between the responding variable and the predictor variables is then of key importance. Interactions between predictor variables, as well as noise in the data, complicate matters further. This problem can be solved with a multiple linear regression or a neural network, both of which utilizes all predictor variables together. However, care must be taken to obtain a model that is truly predictive and not a result of overfitting the data. The workflow was applied to 262 Duvernay wells, ranging from dry gas to volatile oil. No wells were excluded for operational or geological reasons, a strength of this methodology. By not excluding any wells, the model could maximize learnings and establish statistical reasons for the variances in well performance observed. The final model achieved very high predictive power, correctly predicting 78% of the variance in well performance on 52 wells the model hadn't been trained on. Conclusions were quite significant, including: 1. Indicating virtually no benefit from more expensive fracturing procedures, such as using ceramic or resin coasted proppant, or having hybrid fluid systems, offering savings of over a million dollars per well in the Duvernay. 2. No benefit from placing wells on an azimuth (parallel to the minimum horizontal stress) vs. a North-South orientation (~45° off azimuth). This allows potentially large savings on a land ownership system not aligned to this direction, by allowing simpler pad design in achieving the same aerial coverage of reservoir depletion. 3. Confirming total fracture tonnage as a key driver of well performance. 4. Suggesting fracture pump rate is associated with better well performance and should be investigated further. These conclusions would have been very difficult to derive without expensive strategic testing on numerous wells with rigorous control of the completions and geological inputs. When compared to recent well performance of six operators, the neural network predicted substantial ability to improve well performance by varying parameters under operator control. Potential improvement ranged from 19% to 97%, showing large potential improvement for all operators.

"Achieving timely last-mile order delivery is often the most challenging part of an e-commerce order fulfillment. Effective management of last-mile operations can result in significant cost savings and lead to increased customer satisfaction. Currently, due to the lack of customer availability information, the schedules followed by delivery agents are optimized for the shortest tour distance. Therefore, orders are not delivered in customer-preferred time periods resulting in missed deliveries. Missed deliveries are undesirable since they incur additional costs. In this paper, we propose a decision support framework that is intended to improve delivery success rates while reducing delivery costs. Our framework generates delivery schedules by predicting the appropriate delivery time periods for order delivery. In particular, the proposed framework works in two stages. In the first stage, order delivery success for every order throughout the delivery shift is predicted using machine learning models. The predictions are used as an input for the optimization scheme, which generates delivery schedules in the second stage. The proposed framework is evaluated on two real-world datasets collected from a large e-commerce platform. The results indicate the effectiveness of the decision support framework in enabling savings of up to 10.2% in delivery costs when compared to the current industry practice. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",0,10.1016/j.dss.2021.113584,"This paper proposes a decision support framework that utilizes machine learning to predict optimal delivery time periods for last-mile order fulfillment, aiming to improve delivery success rates and reduce costs.

"We consider production management using such elements of artificial intelligence as human-machine learning and decision-making procedures with fuzzy or qualitative guidelines. These mechanisms include heuristic elements, and use the knowledge of decision-makers and experts, their language, and the rules formulated in this language. The problem of the control mechanism optimal synthesis, with the guidelines of the expert, is set. This mechanism models the functions of people in conditions of uncertainty. The obtained optimal control mechanism includes learning and stimulation procedures. The proved theorem offers a solution to the problem of optimal synthesis of the learning mechanism using the dichotomous classification procedure, supported by an iterative pattern recognition procedure. This iterative procedure uses both a formal recursive algorithm and the results of recognition by an expert on images of emerging situations. As a result, adaptive norms are formed to evaluate the effectiveness and stimulate production.

"Despite the exponential growth of artificial intelligence (AI) research in operations, supply chain, and productions management literature, empirical insights on how organisational behavioural mechanisms at the human–technology interface will facilitate AI adoption in small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and subsequent impact of the adoption on sustainable practices and supply chain resilience (SCR) is under-researched. To bridge these gaps, we integrate resource orchestration and knowledge-based view theoretical perspectives to develop a novel structural model examining antecedents to SCR and AI adoption, considering AI adoption as a pivot for facilitating SCR. The structural equation modelling technique was employed on the data collected from 280 Vietnamese manufacturing SMEs’ operations managers. Our results demonstrate that leadership will drive AI adoption by creating a data-driven, digital and conducive culture, and strengthening employee skills and competencies. Furthermore, AI adoption positively influences CE practices, SC agility and risk management, which will help to achieve SCR.

"To enhance the commercial competitive advantage of a firm in a constantly changing business environment, it is very important to enhance the supply chain performance by making it more flexible to adopt any type of changes in dynamic business environment. To improve the supply chain performance and make it more flexible it is essential to control the order amplification or bullwhip effect (BWE) through various stages of supply chain and control the inventory costs by controlling net stock amplification (NSA). These tasks should be done by using accurate demand forecasting. The current study demonstrates a forecasting methodology about nonlinear customer demand in a multilevel supply chain (SC) structure through; integrated techniques of discrete wavelet theory and artificial intelligence techniques including artificial neural networks and adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system.

"The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for predicting supply chain risk has gained popularity. However, proposed approaches are based on the premise that organisations act alone, rather than a collective when predicting risk, despite the interconnected nature of supply chains. This yields a problem: organisations that have inadequate datasets cannot predict risk. While data-sharing has been proposed to evaluate risk, in practice this does not happen due to privacy concerns. We propose a federated learning approach for collective risk prediction without the risk of data exposure. We ask: Can organisations who have inadequate datasets tap into collective knowledge? This raises a second question: Under what circumstances would collective risk prediction be beneficial? We present an empirical case study where buyers predict order delays from their shared suppliers before and after Covid-19. Results show that federated learning can indeed help supply chain members predict risk effectively, especially for buyers with limited datasets. Training data-imbalance, disruptions, and algorithm choice are significant factors in the efficacy of this approach. Interestingly, data-sharing or collective risk prediction is not always the best choice for buyers with disproportionately larger order-books. We thus call for further research on on local and collective learning paradigms in supply chains. © 2023 The Author(s).

"As a successful business strategy for enhancing environmental sustainability and decreasing the natural resource consumption of societies, the product-service system (PSS) has raised significant interests in the academic and industrial community. However, with the digitisation of the industry and the advancement of multisensory technologies, the PSS providers face many challenges. One major challenge is how the PSS providers can fully capture and efficiently analyse the operation and maintenance big data of different products and different customers in different conditions to obtain insights to improve their production processes, products and services. To address this challenge, a new operation mode and procedural approach are proposed for operation and maintenance of bigger cluster products, when these products are provided as a part of PSS and under exclusive control by the providers. The proposed mode and approach are driven by lifecycle big data of large cluster products and employs deep learning to train the neural networks to identify the fault features, thereby monitoring the products’ health status. This new mode is applied to a real case of a leading CNC machine provider to illustrate its feasibility. Higher accuracy and shortened time for fault prediction are realised, resulting in the provider’s saving of the maintenance and operation cost. © 2021, The Author(s).",0,10.1007/s40684-021-00354-3,This paper proposes a new operational mode and procedural approach for managing the operation and maintenance of product-service systems (PSS) using lifecycle big data and deep learning to enhance fault prediction accuracy.

"The reliability and performance of the generating machines in a thermal power plant are crucial to ensure agility and assertiveness in decision-making, maximize economic results, and ensure meeting the electricity sector demands. In this work, a decision support system (DSM) was developed to predict trends and operational deviations in thermal power plants with combustion engines in an automated and reliable way. It is based on digital twin models for thermoelectric generation engines and their subsystems associated with models of machine learning for predictive maintenance, allowing the classification of failures in the generating units of the plant. The models represent the mechanical, thermal, and electrical conditions and parameters of each piece of equipment under normal operating conditions, and the tool generates alerts when deviations from the base model occur. The benefits from event forecasting range from a reduction in operational issues to the company's strategic objectives due to the reduction in corrective maintenance downtimes, resulting in reduced operation and maintenance costs. Considering the real-time execution character of the models, it is essential for the tool to meet the operation's decision-making needs; so an on-premises application is necessary. The proposed architecture can be applied to any industrial sector that uses SCADA supervisors and can be adapted, expanded, and evolved to other generation technologies, such as thermal plants that use different fuels and small hydroelectric, wind, and thermonuclear plants.

"In this paper, we present an innovative decision support system that simultaneously provides predictive analytics to logistic nodes as well as to collaborating truck companies. Logistic nodes, such as container terminals, container depots or container loading facilities, face heavy workloads through a large number of truck arrivals during peak times. At the same time, truck companies suffer from augmented waiting times. The proposed system provides forecasted truck arrival rates to the nodes and predicted truck gate waiting times at the nodes to the truck companies based on historical data, economic and environmental impact factors. Based on the expected workloads, the node personnel and machinery can be planned more efficiently. Truck companies can adjust their route planning in order to minimize waiting times. Consequently, both sides benefit from reduced truck waiting times while reducing traffic congestion and air pollution.

"Purpose: Uncovering the relationship between Industry 4.0 (I4.0) technologies and circular economy (CE) practices is critical not only for implementing CE but also for leveraging I4.0 to achieve sustainable development goals. However, the potential connection between them – especially how different I4.0 technologies may influence various CE practices – remains inadequately researched. The purpose of this study was to quantitatively explore the impacts of various I4.0 technologies on CE practices. Design/methodology/approach: A mixed method consisting of a systematic literature review, content analysis, and social network analysis was adopted. First, 266 articles were selected and mined for contents of I4.0 technologies and CE practices; 27 I4.0 technologies and 21 CE practices were identified. Second, 62 articles were found that prove the positive influence of I4.0 technologies on CE practices, and 124 relationships were identified. Third, based on evidence supporting the link between I4.0 technologies and CE practices, a two-mode network and two one-mode networks were constructed, and their network density and degree centrality indicators were analyzed. Findings: I4.0 technologies have a low application scope and degree for promoting CE. The adoption of a single I4.0 technology has limited effect on CE practices, and wider benefits can be realized through integrating I4.0 technologies. The Internet of Things (IoT), additive manufacturing, big data and analytics, and artificial intelligence (AI) are among the top technologies promoting CE implementation and reduction and recycling were identified as the main mechanism.

"Artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly changed the supply chain process. In this study, we study the effects associated with AI automation of the retailer's order decision in a decentralized supply chain comprising one supplier and one regretful retailer. In the absence of AI automation, the retailer has a regret bias in that it behaves as though considering the deviation between the realized demand and order quantity, when making an ex ante inventory decision. We find that if profit margins of the supply chain are high, regret bias drives the retailer to decline the supplier's contract, whereas, if profit margins are low, regret drives retailers to order more from the supplier. As a result, although the automation of retailer decision leads to a higher expected profit for a retailer that operates in a centralized vacuum, it nevertheless can be a negative force for a decentralized supply chain with either high or low profit margins. Perhaps more interestingly, as a retailer's decision becomes automatic, it is not destined to earn a higher expected profit. In the extreme, a lose-lose outcome can prevail in which automation potentially leaves both the retailer and supplier worse off. © 2021 Production and Operations Management Society",0,10.1111/poms.13498,"This study examines the effects of AI automation on order decisions in a decentralized supply chain, focusing on how regret bias influences retailer behavior regarding supplier contracts.

"Purpose: The purpose of the paper is to develop a concept of organization of the system of science and education in the form 4.0 based on human and artificial intellectual capital. Design/methodology/approach: The methods of regression and correlation analysis are used. The role of human and artificial intellectual capital for provision of effectiveness and competitiveness of the system of science and education is determined, as well as its correspondence to the modern challenges. Analysis of perspectives and limitations of automatization of the system of science and education based on AI is conducted; a model of organization of the system of science and education in the form 4.0 based on human and artificial intellectual capital is compiled. Findings: It is established that in the system of science and education, the decisive production factor is intellectual capital, but human intellect does not necessarily have to dominate in its structure. AI is one of the most popular technologies of Industry 4.0 in the system of science and education, which has wide perspectives of practical implementation. As experience of the leading world universities, which had the highest level of digitization in 2018, showed, foundation on non-breakthrough digital technologies (computer equipment and Internet) does not allow opening the potential of increase of indicators of effectiveness and competitiveness of the system of science and education and bringing it in correspondence to the modern challenges based on digitization. However, correlation of activity of application of artificial intellectual capital with these indicators is four times higher (0.2), as compared to correlation of these indicators with activity of application of human intellectual capital (0.05).

"With no doubt, the adoption of Artificial Intelligence applications in customer service reduces the time to market. Nevertheless, the question remains whether or not its adoption in production and logistics will transform the supply chain into a more agile one in developing countries context. Manufacturers are increasingly facing global competition to fulfil incoming orders within limited lead time, and in compliance with the international quality standards, also supporting a customised service. The emergence of industry 4.0 brought many promises to the leading firms. This research paper gives insight information for applying AI algorithms in production cycle then monitoring the production process and subsequently leading to strategic and tactical engineering decisions through the investigation of a number of case studies. The investigation demonstrates that incorporating AI technologies and machine learning opens up fresh perspectives on a variety of topics, including warehousing and logistics management, cooperation, and supply chain management. AI is embraced by business for productivity improvement, given the fact that the more AI adoption rate, the less employment rate and wages will be. Information & Communication Technology alignment model is endorsed in this paper in order to grant fostering of an environment that streamlines, incentivizes and supports AI expansion prior the implementation of any AI practices to ensure its successful and justified investments. The research concludes that the process is extremely challenging in the context of emerging economies which is restricted with low wages rate, inadequate labour skills and insufficient financial resources. © 2021 The Author(s).

"Artificial intelligence (AI) is considered a mechanism that can improve supply chain resilience. Organisations around the world are investing in implementing AI systems to improve their supply chain and become more resilient to pandemics and disruption. At the same time, practitioners are not fully aware of the factors that impact the implementation of these systems. Alongside this, the extant literature lacks a comprehensive study that evaluates the enablers impacting the implementation of AI in production systems. This research fills this gap by identifying, defining, and evaluating the critical enablers influencing the adoption and implementation of AI in production systems. We extracted twelve enablers, created a conceptual model, and categorised the enablers based on the Technology, Organization, and Environment (TOE) framework. After categorisation, we used the analytical hierarchy process to assess the importance of the enablers presented in the model using data collected from eight experts. The results revealed that technology, as a category, is more crucial than organisation or environment. The findings also indicated that project management is the most critical of all twelve enablers. We discuss the implications of the analysis for practitioners and researchers. We also offer twelve propositions that researchers can empirically assess in future studies. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",0,10.1080/00207543.2023.2167014,"This research identifies and evaluates the critical enablers influencing the adoption and implementation of AI in production systems, using the Technology, Organization, and Environment (TOE) framework and the analytical hierarchy process.

"Real-time monitoring, is  now the integral component in smart manufacturing with the rapid application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in manufacturing. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and  Internet of things (IoT) make the volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity world (VUCA) more reliable and resilient with the stable industrial environment. In this study, two machine learning algorithms such as K-mean clustering and support vector, are used in combination with IoT-enabled embedded devices to design, deploy and test the effectiveness of the vehicle assembly process in the VUCA context. To accomplish this, the design includes both real-time data and training vector data, which were collected from IoT-enabled devices and evaluated using ML algorithms leading to the novel element called Smart Safe Factor (SSF), a critical threshold indicator that helps in limiting different units in assembly line-ups from excess wastages and energy losses in real-time.

"The global supply networks have been disrupted and weak connections exposed to an extent that few people have ever seen in their lifetime due to the COVID-19 epidemic. As a result of the severity of the crisis, every country and industry is feeling the effects, and the massive shifts in demand and supply that have happened throughout the epidemic are easily distinguishable from the effects of previous crises. We looked into the adaptability of alliance management and AI-driven supply chain analytics in the context of an ever-changing external environment. We examined four hypotheses in this area using survey data from the American auto components manufacturing industry. To do the analysis, we used Smart PLS. Alliance management capabilities, mediated by AI-powered supply chain analytics capacity, have been found to increase an organization's operational and financial performance. We also discovered, with environmental dynamics as a moderating factor, that alliance management capability has a substantial impact on AI-powered supply chain analytics capabilities.

"This paper seeks to shed light on the relationship between firm digitalization and the likelihood of launching sustainable innovations (social and environmental, social only, and environmental only), for which the extant research has provided a paucity of evidence. In detail, the role of digitalization is considered in terms of (i) the specific effect of a given digital technology (DT)—among artificial intelligence, cloud computing, robotics, smart devices, big data analytics, high speed infrastructure, and blockchain—and (ii) the effect of the concurrent adoption of multiple DTs (degree of digitalization). Furthermore, the paper assesses if and how the effect of the degree of digitalization is moderated by the implementation of sustainability practices, as the two issues are often treated independently. Research questions are proposed instead of hypotheses. Econometric analysis to answer proposed questions is based on a sample of 14,125 firms, whose information is gathered from the survey Flash Eurobarometer 486. Results reveal that each DT differently affects the likelihood of launching sustainable innovations, while the degree of digitalization is always beneficial. Moreover, it appears that firm digitalization and the adoption of sustainability practices are not complementary. All in all, this paper helps to illuminate current representations of the interplay between digitalization, sustainability practices, and sustainable innovations at the firm level, with implications for research, managerial practice, and policymaking. © 2023 The Author.

"Modern assembly systems adapt to the requirements of customised and short-lived products. As assembly tasks become increasingly complex and change rapidly, the cognitive load on employees increases. This leads to the use of assistance systems for manual assembly to detect and avoid human errors and thus ensure consistent product quality. Most of these systems promise to improve the production environment but have hardly been studied quantitatively so far. Recent advances in deep learning-based computer vision have also not yet been fully exploited. This study aims to provide architectural, and implementational details of a state-of-the-art assembly assistance system based on an object detection model. The proposed architecture is intended to be representative of modern assistance systems. The error prevention potential is determined in a case study in which test subjects manually assemble a complex explosion-proof tubular lamp. The results show 51 % fewer assembly errors compared to a control group without assistance. Three of the four considered types of error classes have been reduced by at least 42 %. In particular, errors by omission are most likely to be prevented by the system. The reduction in the error rate is observed over the entire period of 30 consecutive product assemblies, comparing assisted and unassisted assembly. Furthermore, the recorded assembly data are found to be valuable regarding traceability and production improvement processes. © 2021 Production Engineering Institute.

"The cutting parameters in the part machining process have a great impact on the energy efficiency and economy of the machining system. The cutting parameters in traditional machining are often selected according to the operator's experience, which lack attentions to energy saving and economy. Therefore, a milling process parameter optimization method based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is proposed in this paper. Taking the machining cost composed of cutting energy efficiency and machining time cost as the optimization goal, the spindle speed and feed speed under the combination of different cutting depth and cutting width parameters are optimized. Firstly, the machine tool energy consumption model is established by back propagation neural network (BPNN) regression method to realize the continuity of machine tool energy consumption state prediction, and the processing cost model is established as the optimization objective function. Then, the process parameter optimization problem is formally expressed as a Markov decision process (MDP), and the corresponding states, actions, reward functions and constraints are defined. Finally, combined with the machine tool power consumption model and machining cost model, the simulation environment is established, and the BP-TD3 method is proposed to solve the Markov decision problem of milling parameter optimization. Taking the machining center as an example, the aluminum alloy workpiece is milled. Compared with the classical optimization algorithm, the proposed method can save 95 % optimization calculation time, and ensure that the average processing cost after optimization is close to the minimum processing cost obtained by the classical optimization algorithm. © 2022 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers",0,10.1016/j.jmapro.2022.11.015,This paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method for optimizing cutting parameters in the milling process to enhance energy efficiency and reduce machining costs.

"Poor management practices of road transport assets posed a challenge to the sustainable development of the transport system in developing countries like Nigeria. Studies in the past focused mainly on the performance of road construction process. However, few studies have evaluated the effect of the fourth Industrial Revolution (4.0IR) on the road transport assets in developing countries such as Nigeria. The current study aimed at assessing the effect of the 4.0IR towards improving the management practice of road transport assets. Survey instruments were administered to project and facility managers in the Nigerian road construction sector of the economy using a proportionate random sampling technique. Partial least square structural equation modelling was used for data analysis utilising the Warp 7.0 partial least squares-structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) software algorithm. The software calculates p-values with WarpPLS based on non-parametric algorithms, resampling or stable algorithms and thus does not require that the variables to be normally distributed. The study concluded that the 4.0IR drivers have a moderate effect change on the management practice of road transport assets in Nigeria at the moment. The findings imply that management of road assets in Nigeria would moderately improve due to the 4.0IR technologies resulting in transport, safety and general efficiency and effectiveness of road networks in Nigeria.

"Recent advances in artificial intelligence in general, and deep learning in particular, enable innovations that have a massive impact on society and industries. Autonomous driving, facial recognition, drug discovery, and speech recognition are examples of fundamental innovations facilitated by deep learning. However, the usage and impact of deep learning for cleaner production and sustainability purposes remain little explored. This work shows how deep learning can be harnessed to increase sustainability in production and product usage. Specifically, we utilize deep learning-based computer vision to determine the wear states of products. The resulting insights serve as a basis for novel product-service systems with improved integration and result orientation. Moreover, these insights are expected to facilitate product usage improvements and R&D innovations. We demonstrate our approach on two products: machining tools and rotating X-ray anodes. From a technical standpoint, we show that it is possible to recognize the wear state of these products using deep-learning-based computer vision. In particular, we detect wear through microscopic images of the two products. We utilize a U-Net for semantic segmentation to detect wear based on pixel granularity. The resulting mean dice coefficients of 0.631 and 0.603 demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach. Consequently, experts can now make better decisions, for example, improve machining process parameters. To assess the impact of the proposed approach on environmental sustainability, we perform life cycle assessments that show gains for both products. The results indicate that the emissions of CO2 equivalents are reduced by 12% for machining tools and by 44% for rotating anodes.

"To enhance the efficiency of bridge construction, the wireless real-time video monitoring system (WRITE) was developed. Utilizing the advanced technologies of computer vision and artificial neural networks, the developed system first wirelessly acquired a sequence of images of work-face operations. Then human pose analyzing algorithms processed these images in real time to generate human poses associated with construction workers who performed the operations. Next, a portion of the human poses were manually classified into three categories as effective work, contributory work, and ineffective work and were used to train the built-in artificial neural networks (ANN). Finally, the trained neural networks were employed to decide the ongoing laborers' working status by comparing the in coming images to the developed human poses.

"Consumers’ dramatic demand has a pernicious effect throughout the supply chain. It exacerbates inventory distortion because of significant revenue loss caused by stock-level issues. Despite the availability of several forecasting techniques, large organisations, manufacturing firms, and e-commerce websites collectively lose around $1.8 trillion annually to inventory distortion. If this problem is solved, sales may increase by 10.3 percent. The businesses are concerned about mitigating this loss. Artificial intelligence (AI) can play a significant role in building resilient supply chains. However, developing AI models consumes time and cost. In this paper, we propose a No Code Artificial Intelligence (NCAI) enabling non-technical companies to build machine learning models based on production quantity and inventory replenishment. The development of the NCAI model is fast and inexpensive. However, little research deals with applying NCAI to operations and supply chain problems.

"This paper investigates how the twin transition (digital & green) unfolds within firms by relating investments in digital technologies to the propensity of eco-innovating production processes and models. Drawing on a heterogeneous theoretical background, digital technologies can be hypothesised to enable eco-innovation across the board. However, a greater eco-innovation impact is expected from Artificial Intelligence and from bundling digital investments. Using the new Permanent Census of Firms of the Italian National Statistical Office, these hypotheses are tested on a large sample of more than 150,000 firms. Results confirm that the contribution of digital technologies to a firm’s eco-innovation is mainly driven by investments in AI application areas, while investments in other digital technologies work more selectively. Moreover, new eco-innovative production processes and models benefit from bundling investments in different digital technologies, but with differences among firms of different size. © 2023 Rennes School of Business.",0,10.1080/13662716.2023.2213179,"This paper examines the relationship between investments in digital technologies, particularly AI, and the propensity for eco-innovation in production processes within firms.

"In today's complex and dynamic supply chain markets, information systems are essential for effective supply chain management. Complex decision making processes on strategic, tactical, and operational levels require substantial timely support in order to contribute to organizations' agility. Consequently, there is a need for sophisticated dynamic product pricing mechanisms that can adapt quickly to changing market conditions and competitors' strategies. We propose a two-layered machine learning approach to compute tactical pricing decisions in real time. The first layer estimates prevailing economic conditions-economic regimes-identifying and predicting current and future market conditions. In the second layer, we train a neural network for each regime to estimate price distributions in real time using available information. The neural networks compute offer acceptance probabilities from a tactical perspective to meet desired sales quotas. We validate our approach in the trading agent competition for supply chain management. When competing against the world's leading agents, the performance of our system significantly improves compared to using only economic regimes to predict prices. Profits increase significantly even though the prices and sales volume do not change significantly.

"Problem definition: Providing fast and reliable delivery services is key to running a successful online retail business. To achieve a better delivery time guarantee policy, we study how to estimate and promise delivery time for new customer orders in real time. Academic/practical relevance: Delivery time promising is critical to managing customer expectations and improving customer satisfaction. Simply overpromising or underpromising is undesirable because of the negative impacts on short-/long-term sales. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to develop a data-driven framework to predict the distribution of order delivery time and set promised delivery time to customers in a cost-effective way. Methodology: We apply and extend tree-based models to generate distributional forecasts by exploiting the complicated relationship between delivery time and relevant operational predictors. To account for the cost-sensitive decision-making problem structure, we develop a new split rule for quantile regression forests that incorporates an asymmetric loss function in split point selection. We further propose a cost-sensitive decision rule to decide the promised delivery day from the predicted distribution. Results: Our decision rule is proven to be optimal given certain cost structures. Tested on a real-world data set shared from JD.com, our proposed machine learning–based models deliver superior forecasting performance. In addition, we demonstrate that our framework has the potential to provide better promised delivery time in terms of sales, cost, and accuracy as compared with the conventional promised time set by JD.com. Specifically, our simulation results indicate that the proposed delivery time promise policy can improve the sales volume by 6.1% over the current policy.

"Underground hydrogen storage is a suitable way to create a balance between energy production and consumption. However, if it is able to incorporate a solution such as Carbon Capture and Sequestration, it has brought double benefit to the environment. Hydrogen has a good potential for energy production and transfer, and its behavior in the porous media has differences compared to other gases. In order to achieve the highest recovery factor of hydrogen and carbon dioxide storage and high utility of the project, the operational parameters of underground hydrogen storage and carbon dioxide storage should be carefully determined. The optimization of these parameters is challenging, complex, and time-consuming. Artificial intelligence methods have been developed using optimization methods in this regard. Simulation and investigation of underground hydrogen storage in depleted oil reservoirs were conducted in this study. Using machine learning methods, a proxy model for the UHS process was constructed, and then the operating parameters of UHS are optimized with the help of NSGA-II algorithm under the three objective functions of Net Present Value, hydrogen recovery factor, and CCS. Multi-layer neural networks with different architectures were trained and evaluated on the database. Research results are promising, and the approach is inspiring. It was found that the selected proxy model was able to accurately predict all three objective functions, with a R-squared of 0.9988 and a relative squared error of 0.00048. When an accurate model for NPV is not available, two-objective optimization is more efficient, but if an accurate model is available, adding NPV as a third objective function is necessary to achieve economic solutions. In both optimization perspectives, two Pareto fronts including 500 optimal solutions were determined separately.

"Purpose: Cost estimation is one of the most significant steps in construction planning, which must be undertaken in the preliminary stages of any project; it is required for all projects to establish the project's budget. Confidence in these initial estimates is low, primarily due to the limited availability of suitable data, which leads the construction projects to frequently end up over budget. This paper investigated the efficacy of artificial neural networks (ANNs) methodologies in overcoming cost estimation problems in the early phases of the building design process. Design/methodology/approach: Cost and design data from 104 projects constructed over the past five years in Jordan were used to develop, train and test ANN models. At the detailed design stage, 53 design factors were utilized to develop the first ANN model; then the factors were reduced to 41 and were utilized to develop the second predictive model at the schematic design stage. Finally, 27 design factors available at the concept design stage were utilized for the third ANN model.

"The rise of Industry 4.0 and the convergence with BPM provide new potential for the automatic gathering of process-related sensor information. In manufacturing, information about human behavior in manual assembly tasks is rare when no interaction with machines is involved. We suggest technologies to automatically detect material picking and placement in the assembly workflow to gather accurate data about human behavior. For material picking, we use background subtraction; for placement detection image classification with neural networks is applied. The detected fine-grained worker activities are then correlated to a BPMN model of the assembly workflow, enabling the measurement of production time (time per state) and quality (frequency of error) on the shop floor as an entry point for conformance checking and process optimization. The approach has been evaluated in a quantitative case study recording the assembly process 30 times in a laboratory within 4 h.

"Purpose: In the context of global economic downturn and intense competition, firms are increasingly resorting to supply chains to acquire capital support and achieve sustainability. This study aims to investigate the effect of supply chain finance (SCF) on corporate sustainability performance (CSP) and identifies SCF-related recipes for CSP. Design/methodology/approach: Based on a sample of 1,038 firms that disclose CSP – namely, corporate financial performance (CFP) and environmental, social and governance performance (ESGP) – the authors use a quasi-replication method consisting of empirical analysis with fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to investigate SCF’s effects on CSP. Findings: The authors find that SCF has a “doing well by doing good” effect on CSP. CFP can promote the positive effect of SCF and ESGP while ESGP’s positive effect on SCF and CFP is nonsignificant. In addition, heterogeneity tests show that SCF’s promoting effect on CSP is affected by high-low CFP and ESGP. The fsQCA results verify the empirical findings and reveal five SCF-related recipes for achieving high CSP. Research limitations/implications: This study has the following two limitations. First, we do not consider how SCF affects CSP in different industries. There is a need to investigate whether industry heterogeneity changes SCF’s effects on CSP, especially in prominent industries, such as the energy industry, with its high susceptibility to ESGP, and the manufacturing industry, with its extensive application of SCF. It will be important to investigate these industries to better understand SCF’s role in sustainability. Second, we study the secondary supply chain – namely, core firm–suppliers and core firm–customers. The authors do not consider financial institutions (e.g. banks and guarantee institutions). SCF modes that include the participation of financial institutions, such as factoring financing and reverse factoring financing, cater more to the capital needs of diversified firms. In the future, studying specific industries that have made significant contributions to the application of SCF along with others that are more sensitive to environmental governance could better highlight the effect of SCF on sustainability and help supply chain managers understand the application value of SCF. Future research could also extend SCF participants into multiple roles to explore separate effects. Tracking financing demanders, fund providers and credit guarantors could capture SCF characteristics more comprehensively. Methodologically, it will be challenging to accurately measure SCF networks in terms of quantification. In future work, this could be performed with the help of artificial intelligence. Practical implications: First, our findings indicate that SCF has a “doing well by doing good” effect on core firms. SCF can not only overcome the capital shortage of SMEs but also provide significant benefits to core firms. Second, our findings provide SCF-related recipes to help firms fulfil ESGP obligations without sacrificing CFP under the pressure to “do good.” The authors provide valuable insights and diverse recommendations to help supply chain managers, marketing executives and researchers adjust supply chain management strategies. Third, this work can guide executives in various fields to adopt SCF to achieve sustainability as a risk-mitigation strategy by means of marketing. Originality/value: This study identifies better, more straightforward SCF-related recipes for CSP (consisting of CFP and ESGP) using a quasi-replication analysis that improves upon conventional methods such as regression analysis, which have limited power. The authors provide valuable insights and diverse recommendations to help managers pursue sustainable development. The findings point to practical guidelines and feasible solutions that can support well-founded operational strategic and management decision-making, which can enhance a firm’s competitiveness under uncertainty and a sluggish economy. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",0,10.1108/JBIM-03-2022-0154,"This study examines the impact of supply chain finance (SCF) on corporate sustainability performance (CSP) using a sample of 1,038 firms and employing fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA).

"Problem definition: Airports and airlines have been challenged to improve decision making by producing accurate forecasts in real time. We develop a two-phased predictive system that produces forecasts of transfer passenger flows at an airport. In the first phase, the system predicts the distribution of individual transfer passengers’ connection times. In the second phase, the system samples from the distribution of individual connection times and produces distributional forecasts for the number of passengers arriving at the immigration and security areas. Academic/practical relevance: To our knowledge, this work is the first to apply machine learning for predicting real-time distributional forecasts of journeys in an airport using passenger level data. Better forecasts of these journeys can help optimize passenger experience and improve airport resource deployment. Methodology: The predictive system developed is based on a regression tree combined with copula-based simulations. We generalize the tree method to predict distributions, moving beyond point forecasts. We also formulate a newsvendor-based resourcing problem to evaluate decisions made by applying the new predictive system. Results: We show that, when compared with benchmarks, our two-phased approach is more accurate in predicting both connection times and passenger flows. Our approach also has the potential to reduce resourcing costs at the immigration and transfer security areas. Managerial implications: Our predictive system can produce accurate forecasts frequently and in real time. With these forecasts, an airport’s operating team can make data-driven decisions, identify late passengers, and assist them to make their connections. The airport can also update its resourcing plans based on the prediction of passenger flows. Our predictive system can be generalized to other operations management domains, such as hospitals or theme parks, in which customer flows need to be accurately predicted. © 2021 INFORMS.",0,10.1287/msom.2021.0975,"This paper develops a two-phased predictive system using machine learning to forecast transfer passenger flows at airports, focusing on improving decision-making and resource deployment.

"Despite advanced supply chain planning and execution systems, manufacturers and distributors tend to observe service levels below their targets, owing to different sources of uncertainty and risks. These risks, such as drastic changes in demand, machine failures, or systems not properly configured, can lead to planning or execution issues in the supply chain. It is too expensive to have planners continually track all situations at a granular level to ensure that no deviations or configuration problems occur. We present a machine learning system that predicts service-level failures a few weeks in advance and alerts the planners. The system includes a user interface that explains the alerts and helps to identify failure fixes. We conducted this research in cooperation with Michelin. Through experiments carried out over the course of four phases, we confirmed that machine learning can help predict service-level failures. In our last experiment, planners were able to use these predictions to make adjustments on tires for which failures were predicted, resulting in an improvement in the service level of 10 percentage points. Additionally, the system enabled planners to identify recurrent issues in their supply chain, such as safety-stock computation problems, impacting the overall supply chain efficiency. The proposed system showcases the importance of reducing the silos in supply chain management.

"According to the importance of the conveyor systems in various industrial and service lines, it is very desirable to make these systems as efficient as possible in their work. In this paper, the speed of a conveyor belt (which is in our study a part of an integrated training robotic system) is controlled using one of the artificial intelligence methods, which is the Artificial Neural Network (ANN). A visions sensor will be responsible for gathering information about the status of the conveyor belt and parts over it, where, according to this information, an intelligent decision about the belt speed will be taken by the ANN controller. ANN will control the alteration in speed in a way that gives the optimized energy efficiency through the conveyor belt motion. An optimal speed controlling mechanism of the conveyor belt is presented by detecting smartly the parts’ number and weights using the vision sensor, where the latter will give sufficient visualization about the system. Then image processing will deliver the important data to ANN, which will optimally decide the best conveyor belt speed. This decided speed will achieve the aim of power saving in belt motion. The proposed controlling system will optimally switch the speed of the conveyor belt system to ON, OFF and idle status in order to minimize the consumption of energy in the conveyor belt. As the conveyor belt is fully loaded it moves at its maximum speed. But if the conveyor is partially loaded, the speed will be adjusted accordingly by the ANN.

"The outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic led to restrictions in production worldwide. Numerous firms were affected and unable to keep up production due to lockdowns. In disruptive events like this, the resilience of the production system is of central importance, as the survivability of the entire firm depends on it. In this context, the literature argues that cutting-edge technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), raise the proactive and reactive capabilities of firms, enabling them to better resist and recover from disruptive events and thus, show a higher resilience. This paper takes up this topic and observes the Covid-19 pandemic with the aim to analyse whether a firm's AI-readiness had an impact on its production resilience during the spring 2020 lockdown in Germany. For this purpose, we combine two large-scale surveys containing data from 237 manufacturers in Germany and test hypotheses based on quantitative analyses. Our results show that firms could indeed benefit from AI-enabled production during the lockdown. However, it is also clear that manufacturers have to exceed a certain AI threshold to significantly increase their resilient capabilities and realise positive effects. Our findings not only hold implications for research, but also provide recommendations for the resilience management of manufacturers. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",0,10.1080/00207543.2022.2141906,"This paper analyzes the impact of a firm's AI-readiness on its production resilience during the Covid-19 lockdown in Germany, utilizing data from two large-scale surveys of manufacturers.

"The main purpose of this paper is to develop an implementation guideline for manufacturing companies integrating ISO 9001 requirements and Industry 4.0 technologies. The implementation guideline follows the Plan-Do-Check-Act model of ISO 9001 standard. We interviewed 25 experts and observed the quality management documentation of seven European manufacturing companies. Results emerged using thematic content analysis and we gained further insights from interviewees, allowing us to propose suggestions garnered from the interviews. The guideline demonstrates how requirements can be integrated with Industry 4.0 technologies such as radiofrequency identification tags, smart sensors, the internet of things, smart human interface, enterprise resource planning modules, artificial intelligence to improve a typical ISO 9001 quality management system. Some issues emerged relating to the fear of losing jobs, validation of quality control equipment based on artificial intelligence, and decision-making and problem-solving processes. The implications of this research are mainly related to the opening of a new debate concerning the integration between ISO 9001 and Industry 4.0 as well as the proposal, to our knowledge, of the first tentative integration.

"Many manufacturing firms today are considering whether to adopt one or more technologies associated with the Industry 4.0 vision. Yet, neither academic nor practitioner literature provide much guidance about these technology choices. This article aims at understanding how Industry 4.0 (I4.0) technologies can impact operational performance and at discovering possible synergies among I4.0 technologies. More specifically, the research seeks to analyze the full network of relationships between I4.0 technologies and operational performance, assess the impact of single technologies on performance, construct portfolios of technologies depending on the firms' operational targets, and identify possible operational improvements to achieve by adjusting a portfolio of I4.0 technologies. To pursue these research goals, we use a Bayesian network and machine-learning algorithms to drive firms' investment decisions based on I4.0 technologies.

"The circular economy promotes a transition away from linear modes of production and consumption to systems with circular material flows that can significantly improve resource productivity. However, transforming linear business models to circular business models posits a number of financial consequences for product companies as they need to secure more capital in a stock of products that will be rented out over time and therefore will encounter a slower, more volatile cash flow in the short term compared to linear direct sales of products. This paper discusses the role of financial actors in circular business ecosystems and alternative financing solutions when moving from product-dominant business models to Product-as-a-Service (PaaS) or function-based business models. Furthermore, the paper demonstrates a solution where state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) modeling can be incorporated for financial risk assessment. We provide an open implementation and a thorough empirical evaluation of an AI-model, which learns to predict residual value of stocks of used items.

"Energy intensive industries can be classified into those that process metal, glass, ceramics, paper, cement, and bulk chemicals. They are associated with significantly high proportions of carbon emissions, consume a lot of energy and raw materials, and cause energy wastage as a result of heat escaping from furnaces, reheating of products, and rejection of parts. In alignment with UN sustainable development goals of industry, innovation, infrastructure and responsible consumption and production, it is important to ensure that the energy consumption of EIIs are monitored and reduced such that their energy efficiency can be improved. Towards this aim, it is possible to employ the concepts of digitalisation and smart manufacturing to identify the critical areas of improvement and establish enablers that can help improve the energy efficiency. The aim of this research is to review the current state of digitalisation in energy-intensive industries and propose a framework to support the realisation of sustainable smart manufacturing in Energy Intensive Industries (EIIs). The key objectives of the work are (i) the investigation of process mining and simulation modelling to support sustainability, (ii) embedding intelligence in EIIs to improve energy and material efficiency and (iii) proposing a framework to enable the digital transformation of EIIs. The proposed five-layer framework employs data acquisition, process management, simulation & modelling, artificial intelligence, and data visualisation to identify and forecast energy consumption. A detailed description of the various phases of the framework and how they can be used to support sustainability and smart manufacturing is demonstrated using business process data obtained from a machining industry. In the demonstrated case study, the process management layer utilises Disco for process mining, the simulation layer utilises Matlab SimEvent for discrete-event simulation, the artificial intelligence layer utilises Matlab for energy prediction and the visualisation layer utilises grafana to dashboard the e-KPIs.

"In today's data-driven economy, operators that integrate vast stores of fundamental reservoir and production data with the high-performance predictive analytics solutions can emerge as winners in the contest of maximizing estimated ultimate recovery (EUR). The scope of this study is to demonstrate a new workflow coupling earth sciences with data analytics to operationalize well completion optimization. The workflow aims to build a robust predictive model that allows users to perform sensitivity analysis on completion designs within a few hours. Current workflows for well completion and production optimization in unconventional reservoirs require extensive earth modeling, fracture simulation, and production simulations. With considerable effort and wide scale of sensitivity, studies could enable optimized well completion design parameters such as optimal cluster spacing, optimal proppant loading, optimal well spacing, etc. Yet, today, less than 5% of the wells fractured in North America are designed using advanced simulation due to the required level of data, skillset, and long computing times. Breaking these limitations through parallel fracture and reservoir simulations in the cloud and combining such simulation with data analytics and artificial intelligence algorithms helped in the development of a powerful solution that creates models for fast, yet effective, completion design. As a case study, the approach was executed on Eagle Ford wells. Over 2000 data points were collected with completion sensitivity performed on a multithreaded cluster environment on these wells. Advanced machine learning and data mining algorithms of data analytics such as random forest, gradient boost, linear regression, etc. were applied on the data points to create a proxy model for the fracturing and numerical production simulator. With the gradient boost technique, over 90% accuracy was achieved between the proxy model and the actual results. Hence, the proxy model could predict the wellbore productivity accurately for any given change in completion design. The operators now had a much simpler model, which served as a plug-and-play tool for the completion engineers to evaluate the impact of changes in completion parameters on the future well performance and making fast-tracked economic decisions almost in real time. The approach can be replicated for varying geological and geomechanical properties as operations move from pad to pad. Although the need for heavy computing resource, simulation skillset, and long run times was eliminated with this new approach, regular QA/QC of the model through manual simulations makes the process more robust and reliable. The methodology provides an integrated approach to bridge the traditional reservoir understanding and simulation approach to the new big data approach to create proxies, which allows operators to make quicker decisions for completion optimization. The technique presented in this paper can be extended for other domains of wellsite operations such as well drilling, artificial lift, etc. and help operators evaluate the most economical scenario in close to real time.

"Purpose: The recent innovations of Industry 4.0 have made it possible to easily collect data related to a production environment. In this context, information about industrial equipment – gathered by proper sensors – can be profitably used for supporting predictive maintenance (PdM) through the application of data-driven analytics based on artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. Although deep learning (DL) approaches have proven to be a quite effective solutions to the problem, one of the open research challenges remains – the design of PdM methods that are computationally efficient, and most importantly, applicable in real-world internet of things (IoT) scenarios, where they are required to be executable directly on the limited devices’ hardware. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, the authors propose a DL approach for PdM task, which is based on a particular and very efficient architecture. The major novelty behind the proposed framework is to leverage a multi-head attention (MHA) mechanism to obtain both high results in terms of remaining useful life (RUL) estimation and low memory model storage requirements, providing the basis for a possible implementation directly on the equipment hardware. Findings: The achieved experimental results on the NASA dataset show how the authors’ approach outperforms in terms of effectiveness and efficiency the majority of the most diffused state-of-the-art techniques. Research limitations/implications: A comparison of the spatial and temporal complexity with a typical long-short term memory (LSTM) model and the state-of-the-art approaches was also done on the NASA dataset.

"Alibaba Group pioneered integrated online and offline retail models to allow customers to place online orders of e-commerce and grocery products at its participating stores or restaurants for rapid delivery—in some cases, in as little as 30 minutes after an order has been placed. To meet these service commitments, quick online routing decisions must be made to optimize order picking routes at warehouses and delivery routes for drivers. The solutions to these routing problems are complicated by stringent service commitments, uncertainties, and complex operations in warehouses with limited space. Alibaba has developed a set of algorithms for vehicle routing problems (VRPs), which include an open-architecture adaptive large neighborhood search to support the solution of variants of routing problems and a deep learning-based approach that trains neural network models offline to generate almost instantaneous solutions online. These algorithms have been implemented to solve VRPs in several Alibaba subsidiaries, have generated more than $50 million in annual financial savings, and are applicable to the broader logistics industry.

"Healthcare supply chains (HSCs) have been hard hit by disruptions such as COVID-19. Keeping pace during this interruption has been a significant challenge. HSCs' adaptability and collaboration using artificial intelligence techniques (AITs) have been recognized as key components of supply chain resilience for managing disruption. The current study aims to investigate how AITs might help improve HSC resilience (HSCR) by facilitating improved adoption and collaboration throughout its operation. Data was collected from the Indian healthcare sector and analyzed using the partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) technique. Additionally, an examination was conducted to determine the potential moderating role of supply chain dynamism (SCD) on the adoption and cooperation of HSCs with HSCR.

"The coronavirus crisis disrupted business survivability. Measures, like going concern opinion and bankruptcy predictors, depend on past trends extending into the future. With black swan events, past trends do not extend into the future. We propose two new metrics. The ‘‘Going Concern Survivability Index’’ (GCSI) is the maximum percentage revenue loss that a business can endure as a going concern. The ‘‘One Month Resilience Index’’ (OMRI) is the effect on the net income from the loss of the revenue for its most successful month. While OMRI is straightforward, calculating GCSI requires real options and process mining.

"Recently machine learning has being extensively deployed for oil and gas industry for improving result and expedite process. However, the black box models do not explain their prediction which considered as a barrier to adopt machine learning. This paper is about optimizing hydraulic fracture with machine learning methods and making informative decision with interpreting machine learning model. The solution can show that it could save over million dollars per well and improve well performance significantly. Interestingly, the machine leaning explainability approach was utilized to explain and measure the reason behind of why some wells are performing better than other and vice versa. Hydraulic fracturing modeling and optimization in tight oil and unconventional reservoir requires substantial geological modeling, fracture design, post-fracture production simulation with excessive sensitivity analysis due to complexity and uncertainty in the nature of data. These types of studies are computationally and monetarily expensive. Furthermore, digital oil technology has facilitated the process of data gathering enabled operators to have access to huge amount of data. Common approaches are no longer suitable to handle this pile of data but machine learning methods could be successfully utilized for this purpose. In this paper, a variety types of advanced machine learning methods including linear regression, Random forest, Gradient Boost, XGBoost, Bagging, ExtraTrees and neural network were employed to optimize well completion in Montney formation. The objective was to create a robust predictive model capturing all the effective operational well parameters (features) capable of optimizing the first 12 months cumulative of equivalent well production. Special Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) plots and Partial Dependency plots(PDP) were used to depict how HF completion features influence the prediction of a machine learning model. Furthermore, a novel approach was employed to explain the model prediction of an existing well by computing the contribution of each feature to the prediction. Over 1838 hydraulically fractured (HF) wells producing from 2008 till 2019 in Montney formation have been considered for this analysis. The outcome of Explanatory Data Analysis (EDA) revealed that well production performance has not been improved despite of continues enhancement of hydraulic fracture parameters such as proppant injected volume, length of stimulated horizontal wells, and number of stages per well in the course of two years. This finding raises the concern of whether operators are properly optimizing completion design. After comparing all machine learning methods, Random Forest method was chosen as the most appropriate and accurate method to proceed for further analysis. ICE and PDP plots helped to understand the impacts of different fracturing features on production for individual well in addition to define optimum operation features on Montney Formation. Furthermore, quantifying of each feature's impact on individual well production and linking it to an economic model, we were able to demonstrate potential profit and loss for each well. The model suggests that some wells could have achieved over $1 million extra profit during the first 12-months of production. In this study, not only a reliable predictive data-driven model has been built for hydraulically-fractured wells in Montney formation, but also a comprehensive workflow of sensitivity and explainatability analysis has been introduced to obtain an optimized fit-to-purpose well completion design. © Society of Petroleum Engineers - SPE Canada Unconventional Resources Conference 2020, URCC 2020.

"Nonconformities are the major sources of waste in manufacturing process. Nonconformities cannot be fully eliminated but their occurrence rate can be predicted. This paper proposes a hybrid approach based on ontological modelling and machine learning for predicting the non-conformance rates of a manufacturing process and minimising its associated costs. Based on the proposed approach, the work orders, that are represented semantically using a formal ontology, are first clustered according to their semantic similarities and then, for each cluster, the appropriate models that predict the probability distribution of non-conformance rates are developed. When a new work order is created, the most similar work order is retrieved from historical records, and the probability distribution of its non-conformance rate is estimated by applying the predictive model of the cluster to which the work order belongs. The probability distribution is used to calculate the expected underproduction and overproduction cost and to determine the amount of production that minimises the expected costs. The proposed method was validated using a dataset obtained from a manufacturer of packaging for cosmetics. Compared to the expert’s opinions and other machine learning algorithms, the proposed method demonstrated better performance with respect to cost reduction. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",0,10.1080/00207543.2021.1933237,"This paper proposes a hybrid approach combining ontological modeling and machine learning to predict non-conformance rates in manufacturing processes, aiming to minimize associated costs.

"We analyze the value of foresight in the drybulk freight market when repositioning a vessel through space and time. In order to do that, we apply an optimization model on a network with dynamic regional freight rate differences and stochastic travel times. We evaluate the value of the geographical switching option for three cases: the upper bound based on having perfect foresight, the baseline set by a random strategy, and the case of perfect foresight but only for a limited time horizon. By combining a neural network with optimization, we can assess the impact of varying foresight horizons on economic performance. In a simple but realistic two-region case, we evaluate empirically that the upper bound for large vessels can be as high as 25% cumulative outperformance, and that a significant portion of this theoretical value can be captured with limited foresight of a few weeks.

"The adoption of Industry 4.0 (I4.0) is expected to grow exponentially, especially as it offers efficient and cost-reducing options in an increasingly competitive business environment. The emergent business environment is facing increasing scrutiny and new regulations pertaining to sustainability. Hence, manufacturing in I4.0 is expected to contribute significantly to upping the sustainability quotient of businesses. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) based regime, articulated by the United Nations, provides directions for assessing business performance on the sustainability yardstick. It is therefore imperative to understand and delineate the implications of I4.0 in the attainment of specific SDGs. The current research explores extant literature on this theme along with interaction with expert focus groups, composed of practitioners and researchers. An Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM) approach has been used to identify eight key SDGs relevant and applicable to manufacturing. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), was applied thereafter, using the Super-Decisions software to understand the relationships between the I4.0 technologies (I4.0T) and the SDGs.

"Aviation industry is not only a labor-intensive key industry that creates high added value, but also a technology-intensive industry that includes high-tech technology. It is necessary to actively introduce fourth industrial revolution technologies such as big data and artificial intelligence. Through the introduction of big data technology, which is the core of the fourth industrial revolution technology, aviation industry will be able to analyze and organize customer's tastes and provide customized services. Through this way, the industry can satisfy customer satisfaction, thereby enhancing competitiveness and efficient aviation work. In addition, information produced in each sector such as aircraft maintenance, safety, and navigation can be analyzed with big data technology to predict and maintain, and efficient use of fuel and aviation route can be optimized. However, the level of domestic aviation industry is insufficient compared to overseas aviation industry, and it is time to prepare preemptive and active countermeasures for domestic airlines to create future growth engine and improve productivity through the use of big data, as well as through mid-to long-term strategies to cope with changes in industrial paradigm. In addition, in the modern society where a huge amount of information is studded every day due to the activation of social networks, even tourism industry is also interested in big data analysis to process large-scaled data and extract information. A lot of studies dealing with this subject is proceeding in the level of nation and academia. However, the utilization of big data is still low, and the discussion applied to the aviation service field is insufficient. Therefore, this study aims to conduct more dense research on the effects of big data-based services on the development of domestic aviation industry, corporate image enhancement and repurchase intention. In order to meet the purpose of this study, the theoretical basis of big data technology, aviation service, service quality, satisfaction, and repurchase intention is pursued through domestic and foreign literature and previous studies. And based on theoretical basis, research model and research hypothesis are set up and verified through empirical research. The empirical study conducted a survey on those who received big data-based aviation services provided by domestic airports and airlines. The collected questionnaire data were used as basic data for empirical analysis, and demographic analysis, validity and reliability analysis, correlation analysis, and structural equation path analysis were conducted using statistical program SPSS and AMOS. In addition, the indirect effect was verified by using bootstrapping to verify the mediating effect of satisfaction. The results of the path analysis of the structural equation model for hypothesis verification are as follows. <Hypothesis 1> to examine how the economic feasibility of big data-based air service quality affects satisfaction, <Hypothesis 2> to examine how the ease of use of big data-based air service quality affects satisfaction <Hypothesis 3> to find out how the safety of data-based aviation service quality affects satisfaction, <Hypothesis 4> to find out how the responsiveness of big data-based aviation service quality affects satisfaction; All five hypotheses presented in this study were adopted up to <Hypothesis 5> to find out how satisfaction with air service quality affects re-use intention. In order to verify the mediating effect of satisfaction, the sample extraction 5,000 times and the confidence interval 95percent was set, and Bootstrapping was additionally performed to find out that satisfaction has a mediating effect on the relationship between big data-based aviation service quality and repurchase intention. Based on the results of this study, academic implications and practical implications for raising satisfaction and repurchase intention through big data-based aviation service quality are as follows. The academic implications of this study are that it presented an integrated model that explains the positive impact relationship through the medium of service quality and satisfaction in big data-based aviation services, and that practical research was conducted on users using big data-based aviation services. The practical implications of this study are that airports and airlines need to develop services that can offer the economic efficiency, ease of use, security of personal information and service needs of users when providing big data-based aviation services in order to raise the satisfaction of airline service users through big data-based aviation services. In addition, airports and airlines that provide big data-based aviation services should take the strategy of raising satisfaction to increase repurchase intention. And as shown in the results of the mediating effect analysis, it is suggested that satisfaction should be considered more than any other service factors such as economic efficiency among the service provisions of airports or airlines. Despite these implications, the limitation of this study is that it constitutes an indicator for users who have experienced big data-based services provided by domestic airports and airlines. As a result, it seems to be somewhat difficult that the results in this study can be analyzed comparatively with big data-based services of overseas airports and overseas airlines. Therefore, if comparative studies including the users who received the services of overseas airports or overseas airlines are conducted in future studies, it will be helpful to suggest more realistic and practical direction concerning satisfaction. © 2022, Success Culture Press.

"Overview: Forecasting demand for new products is a challenging task, as it involves capturing relations of complex variables in markets where little or no historical data exist. Managers usually rely on surveys, intuition, and heuristics to forecast new products. Linear statistical tools used to predict demand for existing products are not suitable because there are not enough data to capture complex nonlinear relations in yet-to-be launched products. Other tools are appropriate for aggregate new categories but not for incremental company-specific products. Machine learning can capture complex nonlinear relations, but it usually requires significant amounts of data. Using an expert’s domain knowledge can circumvent the need for vast training datasets. To support product development activities, we propose a method that combines domain knowledge and machine learning to forecast market share of complex incremental new products.

"A critical factor in steelworks concerns setting the steel release temperature from the ladle furnace. The challenge resides in estimating in advance the reduction the steel temperature will undergo during its non-processing time until the subsequent casting process. A poor estimation results in productivity and yield losses in casting and unnecessary energy consumption in the ladle. Given process complexity, a pure mathematical description is not available. This work develops a predictive neural model for the reduction in steel temperature between the ladle and the caster considering the main sources of heat losses. The case study refers to a steelmaking plant in Brazil. After model identification and validation, and a sensitivity analysis study, thirty troublesome steel runs that resulted in unplanned shutdowns during casting were investigated.

"The field of machine learning (ML) is of specific interest for production companies as it displays a perspective to handle the increased complexity within their production planning and control (PPC) processes in an economic and ecologic effective as well as efficient way. Several studies investigate applications of ML to different use cases. However, the research field lacks in research on industry case studies. A broad understanding from a practical perspective and in this context, an evaluation from a data mining and business standpoint is key for gaining trust in ML solutions. Therefore, this paper gives a comprehensive overview of evaluation dimensions and outlines the current state of research in ML-PPC by conducting a systematic research overview. First, the present work provides key dimensions of business and data mining objectives as evaluation metric. Business objectives are clustered into economic, ecological and social objectives and data mining objectives are grouped into prediction accuracy, model’s explainability, model’s runtime, and model’s energy use. Secondly, the systematic literature review identifies 45 industry case studies in ML-PPC from 2010-2020. The work shows that the scientific publications only rarely reflect in detail on a wide range of evaluation metrics.

"The paradigm shift in manufacturing, the transition from mass production to mass customization [1], increases the engineering workload in planning and preparing the manufacturing process. The current software tooling for the engineering activities (computer-Aided design, computer-Aided manufacturing, etc.) are well suited for mass production, but not for mass customization. Artificial intelligence in general and novel developments in machine learning specifically have great potential in attenuating the workload increase of manufacturing engineers caused by the increasing product variance. One important barrier to consider in adopting AI-based software tooling is their acceptance by their targeted users. Manufacturing engineers usually lack in-depth AI know-how and cannot efficiently use AI or ML methods to reduce their workload, although their type of work would benefit greatly from the use of such methods.

"Prediction of Estimated Times of Arrival (ETA) is a challenging problem for the aviation industry. Flights recurrently deviate from their scheduled time of arrival, which has negative downstream consequences that affect the efficiency of operations. Therefore, accurate and up-to-date ETA estimations prior to its landing can help in optimizing the actions to be taken by the different air transportation agents whenever schedule deviations are incurred, and thus reduce the economic, logistic and environmental impact that they cause. This presentation exposes an infrastructure for high-fidelity computation of accurate ETA in real-time, based on a data-driven approach that leverages the use of recorded aircraft trajectories. This infrastructure is composed of different elements: (1) a live ADS-B tracks gathering system embedded in a lambda-architecture cluster, with capabilities for real-time distribution and data lake storage (2) an ETA prediction machine learning model, employing the actual 4D aircraft position as input; and (3) a hybrid cloud architecture to support real-time visualization and distributions of ETA predictions. The proposed infrastructure has been successfully validated in a real environment (Transforming Transport, an European Commission funded project). This infrastructure enables real-time computation and distribution of accurate ETA for any arrival operation of interest. Results supported the envisioned benefits of getting such accurate ETA, which basically turn into a reduction of associated costs for airport authorities and airlines. © 2019 IEEE.",0,10.1109/SEAA.2019.00035,"This paper presents a data-driven infrastructure for predicting Estimated Times of Arrival (ETA) in the aviation industry, utilizing machine learning models based on real-time aircraft trajectory data.

"Sustainability is a key issue in every production activity. At the same time, interoperability of the production processes is almost crucial to the most advanced manufacturing processes, particularly for the automotive sector because of its incidence on overall impact on environment. A new question then arise, quite new indeed: how and to which extent the sustainability of processes can be assured in a more complex scenario of interoperating enterprises? The reason is the variety of regions and thus rules, habits and praxes that might be involved along the product life-cycle. In the paper, a possible solution to achieve sustainability of interoperating manufacturing processes is presented. The solution is based on the most advanced artificial intelligence tools: ontologies. The problem here faced is how to structure and design an ontology-based system for supporting decisions assuring sustainable solutions within an interoperability framework.

"Vendor-managed inventory (VMI) is a collaborative supply chain management practice adopted by many organisations. For making inventoryrelated decisions an accurate forecast is needed. Traditional forecasting models provide close but not accurate forecasts. In the recent years, decision support tools, like neural networks, are used for making an accurate forecast. This paper presents a case study of a small enterprise where a vendor-managed inventory pact was in force between enterprise and a retailer. In the study, various neural networks were used for demand forecasting. The results of neural network based forecasts are found and compared on various fronts. Multi-criteria decision-making tools are adopted for comparing and verifying the results.

"Logistics in companies is a necessary process that has high costs with mostly no added value. Lowering this cost is vitally important for companies to stay competitive. Nowadays, storage systems are a critical part of any company's logistic system, and many of them try to reach an optimum level where they can operate with little freedom of movement of goods declared by the changing market. There are several manual and automated methods to achieve this. However, we hear quite little about the use of artificial intelligence in the field. This study focuses on the implementation of AI technology into warehousing, especially in categorizing goods. After an overview of the recent literature on AI technologies and their application in the field of logistics, the introduction of an AI application follows. The main goal of the application is to categorize each good stored in a warehouse into ABC-XYZ groups, which determines the place of the good in the warehouse and the ordering frequency with the quantity. After acquiring and cleaning the training data from a real company, the determination and selection of the least input parameters is an important and challenging task, which is demonstrated. The effectiveness of the supervised learning can be seen as an ANN (artificial neural network) can output, with the aid of a non-conventional metaheuristic approach - the black hole algorithm - as the learning agent is demonstrated by an example, which also shows the result of an ABC-XYZ categorization run on a dataset from a multinational company.",0,10.22306/al.v10i3.415,"This paper explores the implementation of AI technology in warehousing logistics, specifically for categorizing goods into ABC-XYZ groups to optimize storage and ordering processes.

"Various advanced systems deploy artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to improve demand forecasting. Supply chain planners need to become familiar with these systems and trust them, considering real-world complexities and challenges the systems are exposed to. However, planners have the opportunity to intervene based on their experience or information that the systems may not capture. In this context, we study planners' adjustments to AI-generated demand forecasts. We collect a large amount of data from a leading AI provider and a large European retailer. Our dataset contains 30 million forecasts at the SKU-store-day level for 2019, plus variables related to products, weather, and holidays. In our two-phase analysis, we aim to understand the adjustments made by planners and the quality of these adjustments. Within each phase, we first identify the drivers of adjustments and their quality using random forest, a well-known ML algorithm. Next, we investigate the collective effects of the different drivers on the occurrence and the quality of the adjustments using a decision tree approach. We find that product characteristics such as price, freshness, and discounts are important factors when making adjustments. Large positive adjustments occur more frequently but are often inaccurate, while large negative adjustments are generally more accurate but fewer in number. Thus, planners do not contribute to accuracy on average. Our findings provide insights for the better use of human knowledge in judgmental forecasting. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

"We consider a supply chain comprising a manufacturer and a platform, where the former sells its prod-ucts through an offline channel and the latter. The platform has two operational modes, namely the marketplace and reselling modes. Platform power refers to the platform's ability to increase the market size, while network effects concern the platform's effect on the offline channel. Consumers may return dissatisfied products brought from the platform within a return window. Without artificial intelligence (AI), the optimal production quantities in both the marketplace and reselling modes increase (decrease) with the platform power under low (high) network effects. The optimal profit of the manufacturer in the marketplace mode increases with the platform power and the direction may be positive in the re-selling mode. With AI, the optimal profits of the manufacturer in the two modes always increase with the platform power. Comparing the cases with and without AI, we find that using AI in the marketplace mode increases (decreases) the manufacturer's profit under low (high) network effects. And using AI in the reselling mode increases (decreases) the platform's profit under low (high) network effects. With and without AI, the marketplace mode cannot coordinate the supply chain, while the reselling mode can.

"Because operational environments change over time and technology upgrades are common in fleets of ground vehicles, a large number of vehicles quickly become obsolete. A possible solution is to develop fleets of modular vehicles, which are built with interchangeable components, i.e. modules. This paper evaluates the performance of a future reconfigurable and autonomous vehicle fleet in a high fidelity military operation scenario. The military fleet operates in a hostile environment under a high risk of damage and needs to react to adversarial actions in real-time. The operation decisions are numerous including vehicle reconfiguration, relocation, damage recovery, and dispatch decisions. Given the limited resources and time delays in the operation, decision effectiveness and foresightedness are necessities, which require a good understanding of the adversary, close collaboration among commanders, and breaking of the equilibrium between adversaries. To capture these characteristics, we formulate an intelligent agent-based model for the decision-making process during fleet operations by combining real-time optimization with artificial intelligence. With continuous updating of learning models, the intelligent agents refine their decisions during interactions with the environment and other agents, and evolve their competition strategies according to adversarial historical behaviors. With the same level of resources, the conventional fleet wins when the dispatch decisions are stochastic. However, once each fleets start to learn from each other's behavior, the modular fleet outperforms the conventional fleet. The strategic and operational benefits of fleet modularity are revealed and discussed in terms of win rate, adaptability, unpredictability and damage recovery. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

"Despite advanced supply chain planning and execution systems, manufacturers and distributors tend to observe service levels below their targets, owing to different sources of uncertainty and risks. These risks, such as drastic changes in demand, machine failures, or systems not properly configured, can lead to planning or execution issues in the supply chain.

"We studied the role of industry-academic collaboration (IAC) in the enhancement of educational opportunities and outcomes under the digital driven Industry 4.0 using research and development, the patenting of products/knowledge, curriculum development, and artificial intelligence as proxies for IAC. Relevant conceptual, theoretical, and empirical literature were reviewed to provide a background for this research. The investigator used mainly principal (primary) data from a sample of 230 respondents. The primary statistics were acquired through a questionnaire. The statistics were evaluated using the structural equation model (SEM) and Stata version 13.0 as the statistical software. The findings indicate that the direct total effect of Artificial intelligence (Aint) on educational opportunities (EduOp) is substantial (Coef. 0.2519916) and statistically significant (p < 0.05), implying that changes in Aint have a pronounced influence on EduOp. Additionally, considering the indirect effects through intermediate variables, Research and Development (Res_dev) and Product Patenting (Patenting) play crucial roles, exhibiting significant indirect effects on EduOp. Res_dev exhibits a negative indirect effect (Coef = -0.009969, p = 0.000) suggesting that increased research and development may dampen the impact of Aint on EduOp against a priori expectation while Patenting has a positive indirect effect (Coef = 0.146621, p = 0.000), indicating that innovation, as reflected by patenting, amplifies the effect of Aint on EduOp.

"PurposeThis research aims to forecast the ABI as a leading indicator of U.S. construction activities, applying multivariate machine learning predictive models over different horizons and utilizing the nonlinear and long-term dependencies between the ABI and macroeconomic and construction market variables. To assess the applicability of the machine learning models, six multivariate machine learning predictive models were developed considering the relationships between the ABI and other construction market and macroeconomic variables. The forecasting performances of the developed predictive models were evaluated in different forecasting scenarios, such as short-term, medium-term, and long-term horizons comparable to the actual timelines of construction projects.Design/methodology/approachThe architecture billings index (ABI) as a macroeconomic indicator is published monthly by the American Institute of Architects (AIA) to evaluate business conditions and track construction market movements. The current research developed multivariate machine learning models to forecast ABI data for different time horizons. Different macroeconomic and construction market variables, including Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Total Nonresidential Construction Spending, Project Inquiries, and Design Contracts data were considered for predicting future ABI values. The forecasting accuracies of the machine learning models were validated and compared using the short-term (one-year-ahead), medium-term (three-year-ahead), and long-term (five-year-ahead) ABI testing datasets.FindingsThe experimental results show that Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) provides the highest accuracy among the machine learning and traditional time-series forecasting models such as Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) or seasonal ARIMA in forecasting the ABIs over all the forecasting horizons. This is because of the strengths of LSTM for forecasting temporal time series by solving vanishing or exploding gradient problems and learning long-term dependencies in sequential ABI time series. The findings of this research highlight the applicability of machine learning predictive models for forecasting the ABI as a leading indicator of construction activities, business conditions, and market movements.Practical implicationsThe architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry practitioners, investment groups, media outlets, and business leaders refer to ABI as a macroeconomic indicator to evaluate business conditions and track construction market movements. It is crucial to forecast the ABI accurately for strategic planning and preemptive risk management in fluctuating AEC business cycles. For example, cost estimators and engineers who forecast the ABI to predict future demand for architectural services and construction activities can prepare and price their bids more strategically to avoid a bid loss or profit loss.Originality/valueThe ABI data have been forecasted and modeled using linear time series models. However, linear time series models often fail to capture nonlinear patterns, interactions, and dependencies among variables, which can be handled by machine learning models in a more flexible manner. Despite the strength of machine learning models to capture nonlinear patterns and relationships between variables, the applicability and forecasting performance of multivariate machine learning models have not been investigated for ABI forecasting problems. This research first attempted to forecast ABI data for different time horizons using multivariate machine learning predictive models using different macroeconomic and construction market variables.",0,10.1108/ECAM-06-2023-0544,"This research develops multivariate machine learning models to forecast the Architecture Billings Index (ABI) as a leading indicator of U.S. construction activities, assessing their performance over various time horizons.

"Improving airport collaborative decision making is at the heart of airport operations centers (APOCs) recently established in several major European airports. In this paper, we describe a project commissioned by Eurocontrol, the organization in charge of the safety and seamless flow of European air traffic. The project's goal was to examine the opportunities offered by the colocation and real-time data sharing in the APOC at London's Heathrow airport, arguably the most advanced of its type in Europe. We developed and implemented a pilot study of a real-time data-sharing and collaborative decision-making process, selected to improve the efficiency of Heathrow's operations. In this paper, we describe the process of how we chose the subject of the pilot, namely the improvement of transfer-passenger flows through the airport, and how we helped Heathrow move from its existing legacy system for managing passenger flows to an advanced machine learning-based approach using real-time inputs. The system, which is now in operation at Heathrow, can predict which passengers are likely to miss their connecting flights, reducing the likelihood that departures will incur delays while waiting for delayed passengers. This can be done by off-loading passengers in advance, by expediting passengers through the airport, or by modifying the departure times of aircraft in advance. By aggregating estimated passenger arrival time at various points throughout the airport, the system also improves passenger experiences at the immigration and security desks by enabling modifications to staffing levels in advance of expected surges in arrivals.

"Amazon Locker is a self-service delivery or pickup location where customers can pick up packages and drop off returns. A basic first -come -first -served policy for accepting package delivery requests to lockers results in lockers becoming full with standard shipping speed (3- to 5 -day shipping) packages, leaving no space for expedited packages, which are mostly next -day or two-day shipping. This paper proposes a solution to the problem of determining how much locker capacity to reserve for different ship -option packages. Yield management is a much -researched field with popular applications in the airline, car rental, and hotel industries. However, Amazon Locker poses a unique challenge in this field because the number of days a package will wait in a locker (package dwell time) is, in general, unknown. The proposed solution combines machine learning techniques to predict locker demand and package dwell time with linear programming to maximize throughput in lockers. The decision variables from this optimization provide optimal capacity reservation values for different ship options. This resulted in a year -over -year increase of 9% in Locker throughput worldwide during the holiday season of 2018, impacting millions of customers.",0,10.1287/inte.2023.0005,This paper addresses the challenge of optimizing locker capacity for different shipping options in Amazon Locker by combining machine learning techniques to predict demand and package dwell time with linear programming for capacity reservation.

"In online-to-offline (O2O) on-demand services, customers place orders online and the O2O platform deliv-ers products from stores to customers within a prescribed time. The platform usually hires crowd-sourced drivers as a cost-effective option owing to their flexibility. However, the delivery speed and delivery ca-pacity of the crowd-sourced drivers vary considerably. This service inconsistency brings challenges in precisely matching the delivery supply and customer demand, which may significantly decrease the de-livery efficiency. This study aims to address the challenges by proposing a personalized dispatch model, which integrates the order and driver's characteristics in the order assignment and routing decisions. To achieve this objective, two machine learning-based models are proposed to forecast the delivery speed of individual drivers in real time and customize their delivery capacity dynamically to develop a portrait of each driver's behaviour. Next, a personalized O2O order assignment and routing model is proposed with the integration of the two aforementioned models. We validate our model with a real dataset of one mainstream O2O platform in China. We run a comprehensive simulation to show the improvement in terms of on-time ratio and average delay time brought by the personalization of each characteristic, namely, delivery speed and delivery capacity. We then show that the proposed personalized model can reduce the average delay by 21.60% through comparison with actual routing decisions by the drivers,. The theoretical and numerical results shed light on the delivery management of the O2O on-demand services. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.
