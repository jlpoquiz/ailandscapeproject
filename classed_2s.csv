"This paper aims to estimate the returns to solar panels in the UK residential housing market. Our analysis applies a causal machine learning approach to Zoopla property data containing about 5 million observations. Drawing on meta-learner algorithms, we provide strong evidence documenting that solar panels are directly capitalized into sale prices. Our results point to a selling price premium above 6% (range between 6.1% to 7.1% depending on the meta-learner) associated with solar panels. Considering that the average selling price is £230,536 in our sample, this corresponds to an additional £14,062 to £16,368 selling price premium for houses with solar panels. Our results are robust to traditional hedonic pricing models and matching techniques, with the lowest estimates at 3.5% using the latter. Despite the declining trend, the additional analyses demonstrate that the positive premium associated with solar panels persists over the years. © 2024 The Author(s)",2,10.1016/j.eneco.2024.107768,"This paper estimates the economic returns of solar panels in the UK residential housing market using a causal machine learning approach on a large dataset.

"The environmental effect of operating activities in the manufacturing industry is crucial to the sustainable development of the economy and society. Since we have entered the era of information explosion, the artificial intelligence has been involved to address the environmental problems caused by daily operations. This study examines the complex relation between artificial intelligence application and corporate environmental investment. The results show that: (1) AI application have a direct and positive impact on corporate environmental investment; (2) Managerial myopia plays a negative moderating role, inhibiting the positive effect of AI application on corporate environmental investment; (3) Companies' pollution emission mediates the relationship between AI application and corporate environmental investment. When reduced by AI application, a lower pollution emission will trigger a larger scale of corporate environmental investment; (4) Compared with under-valued companies and those in the Western region, AI application has a greater positive impact on the environmental investment of the over-valued companies and those in the East-Central region. By verifying the relationship between artificial intelligence applications and manufacturing enterprise investment, this study has a positive impact on promoting green innovation in the manufacturing industry and is of great significance for sustainable development strategies. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.",2,10.1016/j.irfa.2024.103403,"This study investigates the relationship between AI application and corporate environmental investment in the manufacturing industry, revealing that AI positively influences such investments while also considering factors like managerial myopia and pollution emissions.

"Research over the past three decades has provided rich empirical evidence for the inverted U-shaped EKC theory, but current problems facing advancing climate mitigation actions require us to re-examine the shape of global EKC rigorously. This paper examined the N-shaped EKC in a panel of 214 countries with 12 traditional and emerging variables, including institutions and risks, information and communication technology (ICT), artificial intelligence(AI), resource and energy use, and selected social factors. The two-dimensional Tapio decoupling model based on N-shaped EKC to group homogeneous countries is developed to explore the inter-group heterogeneous carbon emission effects of each variable. Global research results show that the linear and cubic terms of GDP per capita are significantly positive, while the quadratic term is significantly negative, regardless of whether additional variables are added. This means the robust existence of an N-shaped EKC. Geopolitical risk, ICT, and food security are confirmed to positively impact per capita carbon emissions, while the impact of composite risk, institutional quality, digital economy, energy transition, and population aging are significantly negative. The impact of AI, natural resource rents, trade openness, and income inequality are insignificant. The inflection points of the N-shaped EKC considering all additional variables are 45.08 and 73.44 thousand US dollars, respectively. Combining the turning points and the calculated decoupling coefficients, all countries are categorized into six groups based on the two-dimensional decoupling model. The subsequent group regression results show heterogeneity in the direction and magnitude of the carbon emission impacts of most variables. Finally, differentiated carbon emission reduction strategies for countries in six two-dimensional decoupling stages are proposed. © The Author(s) 2024.",2,10.1057/s41599-024-02736-9,"This paper re-examines the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) theory by investigating the N-shaped EKC using a panel of 214 countries and various factors, including AI.

"The widespread integration of artificial intelligence (AI) technology in the realms of energy and the environment has emerged as a catalyst for transformative shifts toward low-carbon energy structures. However, existing literature and practical applications have yet to delve into the intricate ways in which intelligent technology influences energy structures. Consequently, this study addresses this gap by constructing a comprehensive theoretical model that encompasses robots and differentiated energy inputs. By drawing on the Chinese case, this research investigates the impact of AI on low-carbon energy structure transformation, both theoretically and empirically. The study's results reveal that AI technology significantly advances the cause of low-carbon energy transformation. Notably, this effect is manifested in the post-Industry 4.0 era and regions endowed with abundant renewable energy resources and strong governmental support for innovation. Rigorous robustness tests substantiate the existence of this relationship. Furthermore, adopting smart technology fosters energy structure transformation through industrial restructuring, and introduces the energy rebound effect, thereby partially offsetting its positive impact. Importantly, the study underscores that the efficacy of AI is further heightened when the influx of innovation factors surpasses a certain threshold.

"Energy poverty is a global challenge that constrains economic development, jeopardizes people's health, and impedes the improvement of people's lives. Artificial intelligence (AI) could be an important tool to reverse this dilemma. We utilize a panel data covering 64 countries during 2000–2019 to examine AI's impact on energy poverty. The findings reveal that the application of AI effectively alleviates energy poverty. After a series of robustness checks, this conclusion remains valid. Moreover, heterogeneity tests show that AI significantly alleviates energy poverty in high-income countries and lower-middle-income countries, but this positive influence is not found in upper-middle-income countries. Mechanism tests indicate that the application of AI can generate economic effects, driving technological progress and enhancing human capital, thereby easing energy poverty. Further discussion reveals AI's impact on energy poverty is long-lasting. In addition, its effects are more prominent in countries that do not participate in cooperative organizations.

"This paper offers insights regarding the potential of AI software development to narrow the financing gap in renewables. By employing a panel of 49 economies covering 2011–2020, we estimate a two-way fixed effects model and reveal that AI software development significantly promotes equity investments in renewables while imposing no substantial effect on debt investments in the same field. Such results are robust to extra controls, outlier consideration, and the endogeneity concern. Moreover, it is found that AI software development's enhancing effect on equity investments in renewables manifests when the stringency of environmental policies, especially the intensity of public funding support for environmental-related R&D, is sufficiently high.

"Artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as a new driving force for green transformation of manufacturing enterprises. Drawing from panel data of manufacturing enterprises listed on China’s A-share market spanning from 2013 to 2019, this study finds that AI can promote green transformation of manufacturing enterprises. This finding maintains its robustness after re-measuring the core independent variable and the dependent variable, addressing endogeneity issues, excluding specific research sample, adding urban-level control variables, adding more fixed effects. The promotion effect emanates from the intermediary roles of enhanced managerial efficiency, reduced financial pressures, and the reinforcement of capabilities for green innovation.

"The fourth industrial revolution has brought about key technological breakthroughs represented by artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain (BC), which provide an opportunity for the development of clean energy (CE). We employ a wavelet-based quantile-on-quantile approach to investigate the correlation among AI, BC and CE over different periods and time horizons. The results show that although the integration of AI and CE systems requires a lot of time, it can significantly boost CE development in the long run. However, BC cannot significantly promote CE development except for a few extreme periods. Our results are supported by the mechanism of interaction among AI, BC and CE development, which highlights their relationship. Therefore, the government should focus on promoting the development of new information technologies and their integration with the CE system, which is crucial for the implementation of energy transition strategies.

"This paper examines the impact of changes in the stringency of environmental regulations on productivity growth. We exploit several data sources, including the OECD Environmental Policy Stringency Index and balance sheet information from ORBIS and iBACH, to test the Porter hypothesis, according to which firms’ productivity can benefit from more stringent environmental policies. We estimate the regulatory impact over a five-year horizon using panel local projections. To identify the direction of the effects, we estimate CO2 equivalent emissions for all firms in our sample using a machine learning algorithm. As suggested by the country-level analysis and confirmed by the firm-level analysis, policy tightening negatively affects productivity growth of high-polluting firms and to a larger extent than that of their low-polluting peers. Hence, we do not find support for the Porter hypothesis in general. However, not all policies have the same impact – non-market based policies are the most detrimental to productivity growth – and not all highly polluting firms are affected in the same way – the negative impact is mitigated for large firms, which may benefit from easier access to finance and greater innovativeness. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.",2,10.1016/j.jeem.2024.102995,"This paper investigates the impact of environmental regulation stringency on productivity growth, testing the Porter hypothesis using various data sources and machine learning to estimate emissions.

"We discuss the dual impacts of corporate greenwashing on access to financing. Using data from China's listed firms from 2007 to 2022 and an insightful measurement of greenwashing that uses a machine learning approach, we find that greater greenwashing increases the size of bank loans, the most important financing tool in China. However, we confirm that the effect of greenwashing on promoting financing is inefficient, as it aggravates debt overhang.

"Artificial intelligence (AI) has enormous potential in improving the efficiency and reducing the cost of energy systems; however, it is unclear whether it can help accelerate the transition from traditional fossil energy to renewable energy (RE). Previous studies have primarily focused on the applications of AI in the energy sector from a technical perspective; in contrast, this paper identifies the process and mechanism of AI's impact on the energy transition, using the wavelet-based quantile-on-quantile approach to estimate the impact of various AI quantiles on energy structure quantiles in different periods. Using data from China, the paper finds that the upper quantiles of AI increase the share of RE in total energy in the long term, demonstrating that AI can, by unlocking its vast potential, accelerate the transition to RE. However, in the short and medium terms, AI negatively impacts RE share, primarily due to considerable challenges in integrating AI into the RE sector. Moreover, the non-RE sector may temporarily benefit more from AI than the RE sector.

"This study breaks the research chain on “firm digital transformation-trade green transformation”, focusing on the effect and mechanism in firms' digital transformation on the “cleanliness” of export products. It offers theoretical and empirical support on how to respond to demand for a green transformation in trade by firms in the context of their digital transformation. First, we reveal the mechanism in the effect of firms' digital transformation on export product cleanliness at the theoretical level by extending the Stackelberg game model and constructing a variable for product cleanliness. Second, we build an index to evaluate firms' digital transformation by matching data on A-share listed companies from 2007 to 2016 with a China Customs firm database and quantitatively analyze it with a machine learning algorithm. Combined with the measured export product cleanliness index, this mechanism is empirically tested with standardized measurement methods. Overall, we find that firms' digital transformation can significantly contribute to improvement in export product cleanliness. This finding remains robust to a series of tests and decomposition of digital transformation into various dimensions. The mechanism test found that the digital transformation of firms mainly promotes the improvement of export product cleanliness through the channels of increasing digital factor inputs, promoting green technology innovation, improving environmental management performance and achieving economies of scale. Heterogeneity analysis shows that digital transformation better facilitates the promotion of cleaner exported products from firms certified with ISO14001, whose primary export destinations are countries outside of the EU, and with high disclosure quality.

"This study investigates the impact of carbon taxes on fossil fuel extraction in 13 Asian developing economies from 2000 to 2022. The results affirm that a 1% increase in environmental tax revenues correlates with a notable long-term reduction of 0.16% in extraction. Notably, a 1% increase in patent applications reveals an unexpected connection, manifesting as a 0.9% short-term increase and a 0.19% long-term rise in fossil fuel extraction. A 1% increase in green power generation is associated with a short-term reduction of 0.28% and a long-term reduction of 0.32% in fossil fuel extraction. Sustainable utility imports contribute to a decrease in extraction, while urban population growth amplifies it in both the short and long term, highlighting the importance of sustainable urban planning. To promote environmentally friendly fossil fuel extraction, Asian developing economies can implement an effective carbon taxation system that includes standardized carbon reporting, carbon auditing AI systems, and robust big data analysis. © 2023",2,10.1016/j.resourpol.2023.104530,"This study analyzes the impact of carbon taxes on fossil fuel extraction in 13 Asian developing economies, revealing significant correlations between environmental tax revenues, patent applications, and green power generation with fossil fuel extraction rates.

"Our study explores the relationship between Green Credit Policy (GCP), bank competition, and corporate green transformation. Previous research mainly focused on the impact of GCP on corporate green practices from a single dimension, with limited attention to bank competition and the overall process of corporate green transformation. Using machine learning methods and Baidu Maps API, we innovatively construct indicators for the green transformation of Chinese A-share-listed companies and bank competition from 2007 to 2020. We treat China's Green Credit Guidelines as a quasi-experiment and find that GCP has a positive impact on corporate green transformation, with bank competition strengthening this effect. Notably, the influence of state-owned banks and foreign banks is more pronounced. Mechanism analysis indicates that alleviating financing constraints and promoting green behavior are critical mechanisms through which GCP affects green transformation. Furthermore, this effect is more pronounced in state-owned enterprises, companies with high environmental transparency, regulated industries, and regions with stronger environmental regulations. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",2,10.1111/jifm.12218,"This study investigates the impact of China's Green Credit Policy on corporate green transformation, considering the role of bank competition.

"The integration of renewable generation sources into wholesale electricity markets is expected to reduce day-ahead marginal prices. This effect has been widely evidenced by previous literature and is commonly referred to as the merit order effect. However, the factors influencing the components of final prices, other than the day-ahead market price, have not been subjected to as much study. Nevertheless, they may prove crucial in understanding the dynamics between the interrelated trading segments in the wholesale electricity market. Furthermore, in the context of the energy transition process, the penetration of intermittent renewable energy sources (mainly wind and solar photovoltaic) and the non-storability of electricity at a large scale may result in increased market balancing needs and costs. The objective of this study was to identify the primary drivers of final wholesale electricity prices in the Iberian electricity market, apart from the day-ahead market price, using machine learning techniques. The results indicate that the share of renewable generation in the day-ahead market is a significant factor influencing both the cost of managing technical constraints, which aims to address network capacity issues, and the cost of managing balancing processes and resolving adjustment issues by the TSO. However, both of these costs can be readily accommodated by the market, as they represent a minimal percentage of the final price. These findings are of interest to both practitioners and regulators, as they provide a better understanding of the functioning of the market and have implications for the restructuring of the market towards a more sustainable and competitive electricity system. © 2024 the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press.",2,10.3934/GF.2024014,"This paper uses machine learning techniques to identify factors influencing final wholesale electricity prices in the Iberian electricity market, focusing on the impact of renewable generation on market dynamics.

"Under the constraints of “carbon neutrality” and “peaking carbon dioxide emissions,” artificial intelligence (AI) paves the way for achieving the dual goals of high-quality economic development and carbon emission reduction. This paper tests the effect and mechanism of AI on carbon emission intensity using panel data from 30 Chinese provincial administrative units from 2006 to 2019. Using mathematical inference and theoretical analysis, this paper concludes that AI can reduce the intensity of carbon emissions. Furthermore, this paper uses the SAC model for baseline regression, taking the spatial spillover effect into account. To ensure the benchmark results’ robustness, this paper also applies the techniques of replacing explanatory variables, endogenous analysis, exogenous shock tests, other regression models, and weight matrix tests. The study demonstrates that: The intensity of carbon emissions will decrease by 2.79% for each unit increase in the proportion of AI. Industry heterogeneity demonstrates that resource-intensive AI increases carbon emission intensity; capital-intensive AI does not currently suppress carbon emission intensity; labor-intensive AI can significantly reduce carbon emission intensity; and technology-intensive AI is a viable means of reducing carbon emission intensity. Regional heterogeneity demonstrates that AI has a varying inhibitory impact on the intensity of carbon emissions, with a higher coefficient in the northeastern and eastern regions. Mechanisms exploration concludes that AI helps to reduce the ratio of coal-based energy consumption, enhance energy use efficiency, and upgrade the industrial structure, thus reducing carbon emission intensity. Based on the aforementioned findings, this paper proposes policy measures to enhance the system for reducing carbon emissions. These measures include the implementation of intelligent technology, the enhancement of energy utilization effectiveness through the advancement of artificial intelligence, and the promotion of interdisciplinary collaboration between intelligence and industrial fields. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.",2,10.1007/s10668-024-05085-4,"This paper analyzes the impact of AI on carbon emission intensity using panel data from Chinese provinces, employing various regression models to assess the effects and mechanisms involved.

"The new digital infrastructure (NDI) formed by the organic combination of new-generation information technologies such as 5G, artificial intelligence, and industrial internet is an information highway for data circulation, constitutes the bottom support of the digital economy, and provides excellent new opportunities for enterprises’ green transformation (EGT). In this paper, we match the data of China’s Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listed companies with city-level NDI measurement data from 2011 to 2019 and explore the impact of NDI on EGT from a performance perspective. The paper uncovers the following findings: (1) NDI significantly enhances enterprises’ economic, green innovation, and environmental performance, which implies that NDI can significantly promote EGT. Endogeneity and robustness recommendations also support this finding. (2) Mechanism analysis emphasizes that NDI promotes EGT by enhancing internal capacity building, strengthening external market attention, attracting government subsidies, and deepening green finance. (3) Heterogeneity analysis points out that NDI exhibits a more significant enhancement effect on an enterprise’s EGT when it belongs to the growth and maturity stages, a heavily polluting industry, and a region with a developed traditional transportation infrastructure.

"Energy consumption, which works as the physical engine of economic development, significantly influences the environment; using renewable energy, which originates from naturally filled resources, helps mitigate these adverse effects. The high price of fossil fuels, carbon dioxide emissions, and electricity generation are the most difficult aspects of this kind of renewable energy, which is often regarded as one of the main factors holding back economic progress. An artificial neural network-enabled economic growth model (ANN-EGM) has been constructed in this research to predict the restraining and pushing energy variables that impede economic growth. ANN-EGM optimizes the limiting and driving energy forces, which helps to improve the use of renewable energy and assist the economy's growth. The prominent enhancement in driving economic activity and employment rates may result in cost-effective improvement for the effective production of energy from renewable resources for green computing. The proposed article constructs an ANN-EGM and examines its topological structure and the effect of training errors the network allows on its performance to address issues in green computing technology and sustainable social and economic development. Conventional approaches based on liming and driving energy forces are predicted to be less successful than an ANN-EGM in predicting the increase of the renewable energy industry for green computing and its correlation with quicker economic growth. The study's findings suggest that the ANN-EGM can accurately forecast and verify the limiting and driving factors in renewable energy generation. The experimental outcome demonstrates that the proposed ANN-EGM model increases the prediction ratio by 85.6% and the performance ratio by 86.4% and has a reduced mean square error rate of 10.1% compared to other existing methods.  © 2024 the author(s), published by De Gruyter.",2,10.1515/econ-2022-0082,"This paper constructs an artificial neural network-enabled economic growth model (ANN-EGM) to predict the factors affecting renewable energy's impact on economic growth.

"Interconnectors play a crucial role in electric power systems. They contribute to balancing demand and supply in real-time, guaranteeing efficient dispatch in wide geographic regions, and increasing competition by creating large markets. However, interconnector capacity is a scarce resource because vertically integrated utilities were required to have generating capacity enough to supply most customers within their operating region under a regulated monopoly. Hence, identifying the efficient allocation method is essential, particularly after recent electricity market restructuring. This study evaluates the competitive effect of the implicit auction on the interconnector transmission capacity. The implicit auction allocates all the interconnector capacity simultaneously with electric energy in the day-ahead market. This method prevents market participants from strategically withholding the physical interconnector capacity ex ante to exercise market power, as allowed under the first come, first served rule. This study empirically shows how the capacity was withheld from the day-ahead market under the first come, first served rule using detailed reservation data. Next, I show that the implicit auction increases interconnector capacity available at the day-ahead market and trade volume. I use machine-learning methods, such as random forest and deep neural networks, to predict the counterfactual market outcomes without implicit auction. I find that the gain from trade under the implicit auction is more than US$55 million per year in Japan, which is more than 100 times the implementation cost of the implicit auction. © The Author(s) 2024.",2,10.1007/s11149-024-09476-3,"This paper evaluates the competitive effects of implicit auctions on interconnector transmission capacity in electricity markets, using machine learning methods to predict counterfactual outcomes without the implicit auction.

"The construction of China’s Free Trade Zones (FTZs) promotes high-quality economic development. And with the continuous development of information technology, as well as the popularity and application of artificial intelligence, big data, cloud computing, and other technologies, the construction of FTZs offers more possibilities for enterprises to implement digital transformation. Constructing China’s Free Trade Zones (FTZs) encourages high-quality economic growth. As an essential path in support of high-quality economic development, it is imperative to clarify the intrinsic connection between enterprise digital transformation (EDT) and the establishment of FTZs. The article analyzes the impact of constructed FTZs on EDT based on 2010–2019 microdata of A-share listed enterprises in Shanghai and Shenzhen. It is observed that FTZ construction promotes EDT. After a number of robustness tests, this finding is still valid. The mechanism analysis confirms that constructed FTZs enhance EDT by weakening firms’ external economic policy uncertainty and improving firms’ internal innovation performance. Through heterogeneity analysis, this paper finds that leveraging firm value, improving firms’ ESG performance, and strengthening firms’ digital finance development are effective ways for FTZs to promote EDT. Finally, the analysis of environmental consequences shows that China’s FTZ construction reduces carbon emissions and improves air pollution caused by the development process by enhancing EDT.

"Today, low-carbon development and smart city pilots are prevalent. Against this backdrop, an urgent need exists to clarify the impact of smart city construction on low-carbon development. However, studies on the low-carbon development effects of smart city construction remain scarce. Therefore, this in-depth study focuses on China, the world’s largest developing country, to examine the role of smart city construction in promoting low-carbon development. First, we calculate the carbon total factor productivity of 182 prefecture-level cities in China using the slacks-based global Malmquist–Luenberger index. Second, to empirically examine the impact of smart city construction on carbon total factor productivity, we employ a multi-period difference-in-difference (DID) model and a machine learning-based propensity score matching DID (PSM-DID) model. The results reveal that smart city construction significantly enhances carbon total factor productivity and low-carbon technological efficiency, while its impact on low-carbon technological progress is nonsignificant. Mechanism tests indicate that smart city construction can improve carbon total factor productivity through the following three channels: green technological innovation, industrial structure upgrading, and resource allocation. Heterogeneity tests indicate that all three batches of smart city construction improve carbon total factor productivity, and that the positive effect of the third batch is greater than that of the first and second batches. Furthermore, the carbon total factor productivity promotion effect of smart city construction is stronger in megacities and cities in the central region. Finally, we propose relevant policy implications.

"Technological innovation development plays a pivotal role in mineral economics. History shows that the difference between a mineral deposit's economic status and its uneconomic status lies in the mining technological innovation most prevalent in each phase of technological development. The significance of mining technology is that it curbs the negative impact of mineral deposit depletion by improving productivity, thereby keeping mineral exploitation profitable. This relationship makes it imperative to develop a framework that utilises this concept to sustain mining in the future. The framework will incorporate the benefits of technological innovation implementation to demonstrate its impact on a company's share price. It will help public investors understand share price performance while serving as an additional internal new technology investment approval tool. This paper demonstrates how applying technological development and innovation affects mining processes and its economics. This relationship is evident throughout the four historical mining technological stages, which started in the 18th Century with mechanisation, then remote control, automation, and currently, autonomous technology systems. At each stage, the need for a more productive technology arose as the effects of mineral resources depletion threatened mining's profitability. Thus, it can be judged that the future of mining profitability lies in the current advanced technologies that leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning systems. Nonetheless, while mineral commodity miners profit and firm market values grow, the growth is not empirically linked to the technological innovation development that drives it. Conversely, in other industries, the firm's technological development innovation resultant economic metrics, along with macroeconomic factors, are captured and empirically linked to stock market value.

This robust correlation highlights the industry’s role as an economic catalyst, particularly with integrating AI-driven enhancements. Urbanization introduces a threshold effect into the relationship between sports lottery sales and economic growth. This nuanced effect implies that urbanization magnifies the economic impact of sports lottery sales up to a certain point. Understanding this threshold effect is crucial for maximizing the industry’s contributions. Contrary to conventional wisdom, aging population dynamics do not significantly inhibit the economic growth of sports lottery sales. Instead, this influence is context-dependent, varying across regions. Context-specific factors, such as pension plans and senior citizen engagement in leisure activities, can mitigate the adverse effects, challenging stereotypes about elderly consumers. Further analyses highlight the presence of regional heterogeneity, with the economic growth effect of sports lottery sales gradually weakening from eastern to western regions of China. These regional disparities underscore the importance of tailoring strategies and policies to address unique challenges and opportunities in different geographical areas. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2,10.1007/s13132-023-01640-y,"This paper investigates the impact of sports lottery sales on economic growth in China, emphasizing the role of AI and examining factors like urbanization and population aging.

"Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai are located in the Yangtze River Delta, with a high degree of openness to the outside world and a developed economy, which is the region with the most vital economic strength in the country. Studying the economic development of this region can refer to the development of other regions in China. Machine learning, as an integral part of AI, is an important driver of AI scientific research and application areas, and will bring about a series of fundamental changes in traditional decision-making mechanisms. Principal component analysis itself is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that is mainly used for dimensionality reduction of data. This approach in this paper can reveal features of regional economic quality evaluation that are more convenient for our understanding.

"Access to electricity is typically the main benefit associated with solar panels, but in economically less developed countries, where access to electricity is still very limited, solar panel systems can also serve as means to generate additional income and to diversify income sources. We analyze high-frequency electricity usage and repayment data of around 70,000 households in Tanzania that purchased a solar panel system on credit, in order to (1) determine the extent to which solar panel systems are used for income generation, and (2) explore the link between the usage of the solar system for business purposes and the repayment of the customer credit that finances its purchase. Based on individual patterns of energy consumption within each day, we use XGBoost as a supervised machine learning model combined with labels from a customer survey on business usage to generate out-of-sample predictions of the daily likelihood that customers operate a business. We find a low average predicted business probability; yet there is considerable variation across households and over time. While the majority of households are predicted to use their system primarily for private consumption, our findings suggest that a substantial proportion uses it for income generation purposes occasionally. Our subsequent statistical analysis regresses the occurrence of individual credit delinquency within each month on the monthly average predicted probability of business-like electricity usage, relying on a time-dependent proportional hazards model. Our results show that customers with more business-like electricity usage patterns are significantly less likely to face repayment difficulties, suggesting that using the system to generate additional income can help to alleviate cash constraints and prevent default. © 2021 The Author(s)",2,10.1016/j.deveng.2021.100074,"This paper analyzes the impact of solar panel systems on income generation and credit repayment among households in Tanzania, using high-frequency electricity usage data and machine learning (XGBoost) to predict business usage.

"Greenwashing is the misleading use of environmental claims to market non-eco-friendly products, a growing concern as environmentally conscious consumers seek eco-friendly options. This study aims to identify factors that allow the detection of “greenwashing” practices in Colombian companies across various industrial sectors holding certifications such as ISO14001, the Colombian environmental seal, the district environmental excellence program, or international/regional environmental certifications. We employed a quantitative, cross-sectional methodology using three machine learning algorithms (Decision Tree Classification, Random Forest, Logistic Regression) and the double machine learning technique to identify causal effects and significant variables. Additionally, a greenwashing indicator was formulated, considering two variables: (a) Presence of a comprehensive solid waste management plan, and (b) Presence of a water usage and conservation program. Our findings reveal substantial variations in the adoption of environmental management practices across diverse industrial sectors and regions in Colombia. It is noteworthy that our research emphasizes that: (i) companies with an environmental contingency plan and a monitoring program are less likely to engage in greenwashing; (ii) expenses for personnel dedicated to environmental protection activities and the investment and expenses related to air and climate protection also reduce the likelihood of greenwashing; (iii) companies in the manufacturing of non-metallic mineral products sector are more likely to engage in greenwashing. It was also found that a significant proportion of Colombian industrial companies with environmental certifications do not fully embrace sustainable practices, implying limited effectiveness of environmental certifications in the country (56,09%). This research contributes to the taxonomy of greenwashing by delving into various types identified in the literature. It sheds light on selective disclosure, emphasizing that mere certification without tangible actions can constitute greenwashing. The broadened concept of decoupling now includes not only meeting shareholder expectations but also failing to meet those set by certifications. Attention deflection involves diverting focus toward certifications rather than real investments in environmental practices. Deceptive manipulation occurs when certifications create a misleading perception without concrete actions. Additionally, dubious authorizations and labels are revealed, showcasing the vulnerability of eco-labels to fraud. The study enriches existing categories, viewing certifications as potential instruments for greenwashing, reinforcing the need for substantial, measurable actions to validate sustainability claims. © 2024 The Author(s)",2,10.1016/j.resglo.2024.100196,"This paper investigates greenwashing practices in Colombian companies by employing machine learning algorithms to identify factors that contribute to misleading environmental claims.

"Investigating the vital role of artificial intelligence is essential to develop the electric vehicle market. This study utilises the wavelet-based QQR methodology to seize the dynamic correlation of artificial intelligence index (AII) and electric vehicle indicator (EVI). Based on quantitative deliberations, the favourable effects of AII on EVI at low-low and high-high quantiles and adverse impacts at high-low and low-high quantiles in the short run confirm the role of artificial intelligence in facilitating the electric vehicle market. However, the favourable effect of AII at medium to high quantiles on EVI at low quantiles refutes it because of the crowding-out effect. Conversely, the positive impact of EVI at medium to high quantiles on AII at low to medium quantiles ascertains the crowding-out effect of electric vehicles, while AII at medium to high quantiles cannot agree on it due to safety and convenience needs. In the mid-to-long term, the interactions of AII and EVI are gradually weakened, and speculative behaviours, crowding-out effects, and safety concerns drive the different cases. Therefore, a win-win situation between them does not always hold, and recommendations are being offered to enhance the significance of artificial intelligence in electric vehicles under the new round of scientific and technological revolution. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",2,10.1016/j.eneco.2024.107613,"This paper investigates the dynamic correlation between artificial intelligence and the electric vehicle market using wavelet-based QQR methodology.

"Using data for 285 cities in China spanning the period from 2010 to 2019, we investigate the overall effect, heterogeneity, and mechanisms of industrial cluster development on urban economic resilience using the staggered difference-in-differences method (DID). Our study shows that innovative industrial clusters can improve local urban economic resilience and offer a cumulative learning effect, but increase economic vulnerability in neighboring cities. A heterogeneity analysis finds that piloting innovative industrial clusters has a more significant influence on economic resilience in more mature clusters, middle-labor-scale cities, areas with moderate economic development, and regions applying more artificial intelligence (AI) technology. An influencing mechanism analysis shows that piloting innovative industrial clusters mainly appears as a scale effect in the earlier stage of green finance development, while there is a network effect in the later stage, both of which promote economic resilience.

"The semiconductor industry provides technological support for a wide range of industries, including artificial intelligence, communications, consumer electronics, and medical instruments, but it also contributes to high resource consumption and pollution emissions, which are detrimental to global sustainable development. To promote the semiconductor industry's economic stability and sustainability in parallel with ecological and environmental protection, public awareness of sustainability is driving manufacturers to improve resource utilization and achieve green production of their products. To encourage manufacturers to contribute to global sustainability, governments are involved in supply chain decision-making based on resource and compensation policies. Using efficient resource utilization as an entry point, this study aims to explore whether manufacturers can effectively address the risk known as “strangle hold stuck neck” based on advanced resource utilization in their manufacturing processes, and the role of resource compensation versus full information in this context. The study shows that, in the presence of business competition or geopolitical factors, the disclosure of resource utilization levels to upstream technology suppliers by manufacturers with green production advantages increases their exposure to price increases. Whether or not upstream technology suppliers change their technology licensing decisions or have full information, resource efficiency policies can contribute to a stable product supply and more efficient resource utilization. Notably, there are limits to the setting of taxes and subsidies in resource compensation policies, and different scenarios exhibit different limiting functions for subsidies and taxes. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",2,10.1016/j.ijpe.2024.109227,"This paper explores the semiconductor industry's resource utilization and its impact on sustainability, focusing on the role of government policies in promoting green production.

"The heavy reliance of industry on harmful gases is a direct cause of extensive pollution in the atmosphere. This has severe and adverse effects on both human health and the environment. This study aims to explore the impact of women entrepreneurship, digital technology, and economic growth on carbon dioxide emissions in India, with the aim of understanding how these factors interrelate and influence sustainability efforts. The study employs the dynamic ARDL (DYARDL) model and the KRLS machine learning algorithm to identify the relationship between these variables in India. The results indicate that women entrepreneurship has a negative effect on carbon dioxide emissions. The study reveals that women entrepreneurs often operate in sectors that are less energy-intensive and have lower emissions compared to sectors traditionally dominated by men. Therefore, their involvement may contribute positively to overall sustainability efforts. Furthermore, the study also reveals the positive effect of digital technology and economic growth on CO2 emissions. As digital technology advances and economic growth accelerates, energy consumption and production tend to result in higher CO2 emissions. This finding underscores the need for sustainable industrial technology practices and policies to mitigate the environmental impact.

"The present study investigates the strategic mechanisms employed by manufacturing firms to transform green finance initiatives into resilient capabilities amidst prolonged turbulence. Drawing from the resource-based view and the integration–responsiveness framework, the study explores the impact of green finance and green and blue infrastructure on sustainable competitive advantages and resilience amid ongoing political and economic uncertainty in Pakistan, with additional moderation by smart technology, artificial intelligence, robotics, and algorithms capabilities. Data were collected from 390 executives in the manufacturing sector of Pakistan, and the analysis was conducted through a two-stage structural equation modeling-artificial neural network approach. The findings reveal that green and blue infrastructure acts as mediators in the relationship between green finance and firms’ competitive advantages and resilience. Furthermore, sustainable competitive advantages sequentially mediate the relationship from green finance to green/blue infrastructure and subsequently to firm resilience. Organizational smart technology, artificial intelligence, robotics, and algorithms capabilities moderate these relationships, strengthening the association between green/blue infrastructure, competitive advantages, and firm resilience.

"Complex water-related challenges hunger, poverty, climate change, biodiversity, land-use change, desertification agriculture, industrialization, urbanization, human population, and hygiene, need wise and urgent actions to overcome them. Globally, many drivers such as the U.S.-Chinese competition, the Russo–Ukrainian war, food security, pandemics, and human overpopulation, have water-related impacts. Freshwater is a truly complex interdisciplinary topic that requires innovative intelligent-inclusive ideas to reconcile limited water resources with expanding water demands. The article explores how artificial intelligence (AI) could rethink human-water interactions, remake water practices, humanize water science, and enhance daily water life. The Global Goals could be viewed as an integrated framework of human effort to face pressing today’s issues and to formulate a more sustainable and better world. Goal 6 (SDG 6 “sustaining water”) devoted to sustaining water and related actions for all humans is the skeleton of global goals (GGs). The Arabsphere faces severe water quality, quantity, and practice challenges to ensure the smooth achievement of global goals (GGs). Compared with the whole world and its main regions, the overall water stress indicator in the Arabsphere is greater than 100% (critical). This article explores how applied intelligence could be strengthened to achieve Goal 6, focuses on the “water stress” indicator, and how to ensure a sustainable water future (SWF) in the Arabsphere.

"The energy transition brings various technical, economic, and organizational challenges. One major topic, especially in zonal electricity markets, is the organization of future congestion management. Local flexibility market (LFM) is an often discussed concept of market-based congestion management. Like the whole energy system, the market transparency of LFMs can influence individual bidders' behavior. In this context, the predictability of the network status of distribution networks and an LFM's outcome, depending on a given transparency policy, is investigated in this paper. For this, forecast models based on artificial neural networks (ANN) are implemented on synthetic distribution network and LFM data. Three defined transparency policies determine the amount of input data used for the models. The results suggest that the transparency policy can influence the distribution network status and LFM outcome predictability, but appropriate forecasts are generally feasible. Therefore, the transparency policy should not conceal information but provide a level playing field for all parties involved.

"Water quality amelioration is one of the key ecosystem services provided by forests in the catchment areas of water supply systems. In this study, we applied random effect models and the least absolute shrinkage and selection regression method of machine learning to South African panel data to estimate the causal effect of natural forest cover on municipalities' water treatment cost. We controlled for a range of confounding covariates including other land cover variables including wetlands, plantation forests, grassland, woodland etc. The Lasso based instrumental variable (IV) method allowed us to simultaneously account for model uncertainty surrounding variable selection and endogeneity bias. We found significant and robust evidence that natural forestland cover reduces water treatment costs at the intensive margin. Estimates from our preferred models indicated that the marginal benefit of increasing forest cover is R310.63 /ha/year. We also found that the elasticity response of water treatment cost to natural forest area is 0.02%. Our estimate of the marginal value of the water purification service is small compared to the producer's surplus from alternative land uses. However, protection of natural forest land use might be defended if other ecosystem goods and services provided by natural forests are taken into account. © 2022 Journal of Environmental Economics and Policy Ltd.",2,10.1080/21606544.2021.2024094,"This study uses random effect models and machine learning techniques to analyze the causal effect of natural forest cover on water treatment costs in South African municipalities.

"As a measure of corporate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance, ESG ratings have increasingly gained attention from corporations, the public, and government agencies, gradually becoming a key factor influencing their perceptions and decision-making regarding corporations. This study explores the impact of corporate ESG ratings on Total Factor Productivity (TFP) and its underlying mechanisms. Using listed companies in China as the research sample, it was found that higher ESG ratings significantly enhance corporate TFP, a conclusion that holds even after conducting robustness checks and addressing endogeneity issues. Further analysis indicates that high ESG ratings improve corporate TFP by reducing financing constraints and increasing government subsidies. Heterogeneity analysis shows that the effect of ESG ratings on enhancing TFP is more pronounced for corporations with high levels of attention, good reputations, and high audit quality. Additionally, the study also examines whether ESG ratings can serve as an effective predictor of corporate TFP. By applying machine learning algorithms for validation, the results show that incorporating ESG ratings significantly improves the accuracy of predictions for corporate TFP. © 2023",2,10.1016/j.irfa.2024.103381,"This paper investigates the relationship between corporate ESG ratings and Total Factor Productivity (TFP) in Chinese listed companies, analyzing how ESG ratings enhance TFP through mechanisms like reduced financing constraints and increased government subsidies.

"With the rapid advancement of the deep integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and traditional industries, industrial intelligence has a greater influence on the economy and the environment, which is of great significance in promoting green development. However, the impact of industrial intelligence on green development and the mechanism of its impact are not yet clear. In light of this, this paper uses 284 Chinese cities as samples to examine the influence of industrial intelligence on green development, explores the impact path of industrial intelligence on green development through intra- and inter-industry linkage effects, and addresses the moderating role of environmental regulation intensity on the relationship between them. It is discovered that there is a U-shaped feature between industrial intelligence and green development, and environmental regulation intensity can smooth the curve relationship between them. Heterogeneity analysis found that regional characteristics, industry type, and city size will make the U-shaped impact different. Further mechanism testing reveals that the low level of industrial intelligence inhibits energy utilization efficiency and causes a low-end service industry structure, which is not conducive to green development. When the level of industrial intelligence is high, it promotes energy utilization efficiency and a high-end service industry structure, which is conducive to green development.

"In the context of sustainable development, the enhancement of energy efficiency (EF) for achieving cleaner production has become a prominent area of academic interest. Accordingly, this study explores the correlation between artificial intelligence (AI) investments and corporate EF to strike a balance between economic growth and ecological products value realization. In light of the “double carbon” target constraints and economic challenges, addressing this question holds paramount theoretical and practical significance. This study primarily utilizes data from Chinese listed companies from 2007 to 2021 to gauge the influence of AI on corporate EF. Results of our benchmark regression analysis reveal that a 1 percentage point increase in AI investment can lead to a corresponding 0.0228 percentage point improvement in enterprise EF. Additionally, employing the Heckman model, our study establishes that the enterprise EF data examined herein has no sample selection bias. Furthermore, no endogenous selection issues were observed within the scope of our study. Exploring the mechanisms of this relationship, our analysis demonstrates that the number of independent green patent applications and the sustainability accounting index strengthen the positive impact of AI on corporate EF.

"This study examines the impact of green bond issuance on stock price synchronicity among peer companies in the Chinese listed firms from 2013 to 2021. The findings reveal that the issuance of green bonds leads to a decrease in stock price synchronicity among peer companies, particularly within industries characterized by higher levels of competition. By employing machine learning techniques to identify green-innovation textual information in green bond prospectuses, we find that a higher proportion of green-innovation textual information, particularly company-specific and forward-looking information, strengthens the spillover effects of green bond issuance. Mechanism tests demonstrate that expanding investor information channels and improving information disclosure quality among peer companies are the main pathways through which green bond issuance generates spillover effects. In terms of economic consequences, we find that the spillover effects of green bond issuance contribute to reducing financing constraints among peer companies and enhancing environmental performance.

"Studying the interrelationship among artificial intelligence, supply chain and energy market is crucial to achieving sustainable development. The research uses the TVP-SV-VAR methodology to recognise the ever-changing correlation among the artificial intelligence index (AII), global supply chain pressure indicator (GSCPI) and global energy-related uncertainty index (GEUI). In light of quantitative discussions, it is presented that AII exerts negative influences on GSCPI and GEUI, highlighting that the development of artificial intelligence would facilitate global supply chain stability and energy sustainability; in turn, GSCPI and GEUI have positive and adverse influences on AII. Through comparing, the correlation between AII and GEUI is only reflected in the short term, whereas the interrelationship between AII and GSCPI could be observed in the short-, medium- and long-run situations. In addition, GSCPI exerts positive and negative influences on GEUI in the short, medium and long runs, whereas the positive effects of GEUI on GSCPI means the uncertainty in the energy market might destroy the supply chain across the globe.

We develop a novel virtual merging method based on machine learning techniques to compile the data of the control group and estimate the effect of the large-scale consolidation in Japan on the various costs of managing municipal solid waste. We find that these mergers actually led to an increase in the total cost per ton. Estimation results also reveal that the construction cost increased in the post-merger period, which can be explained by the special bonds provided by the national government for new projects in merged municipalities. By contrast, the processing and management cost is little affected by the mergers, except for the absorption-type mergers and municipalities that never joined waste management associations.

"Artificial intelligence (AI) has experienced significant momentum worldwide in recent years. However, its rapid growth has raised concerns about energy shortages due to its high energy consumption, despite its potential to conserve energy in various ways. This study seeks to investigate the impact of AI on enterprise energy intensity (EI) by analyzing data from Chinese manufacturing listed enterprises during the period of 2011–2019. The findings reveal that the widespread adoption of AI can significantly reduce enterprise EI. Specifically, incorporating an additional unit of industrial robots per hundred workers leads to an approximate 2.5% reduction in enterprise EI. These conclusions remain robust after performing various tests. Moreover, the reduction effect of AI on enterprise EI is more pronounced in enterprises with high energy-dependence, non-labor-intensive enterprises, and state-owned enterprises (SOEs).

"Purpose: This study aims to investigate how a firm's management team's capacity to efficiently use its resources affects the firm's exposure to climate change. Specifically, the authors investigate the intriguing question – does managerial ability affect a firm's climate change exposure? Design/methodology/approach: The authors use an unbalanced panel dataset of 4,230 US based firms listed on Compustat from 2002–2019 and test the hypothesis by panel regression analysis. To mitigate endogeneity concerns, difference-in-differences and instrumental variable approaches are used. Findings: The baseline analysis shows a negative, statistically significant impact of managerial ability on climate change exposure. The findings hold after controlling for endogeneity using two-stage least squares regression and difference-in-differences tests. The authors find the negative effect is stronger for managers engaged in socially responsible activities, and after climate change issues receiving greater public awareness following the 2006 release of the Stern Review and the 2016 signing of the Paris Accord.

We then use machine learning for variable selection and show that it is able to capture pre-trends unrelated to the policy, improving the credibility of our estimates. We find that the program could have reduced consumption by up to 9% during peak periods, with significant spillovers to weekends. Using a more conservative estimator, we find that it reduced consumption by at least 1%–2% during peak periods. We find evidence of habit formation during periods of uniform pricing, accompanied by an adaptation process that ends with a permanent change in consumption behavior.

To systematically investigate the impacts of the application of artificial intelligence in the workforce on household energy consumption in China, empirical analysis is conducted using data from the China General Social Survey (CGSS) from May to September 2022. The findings are as follows: (1) AI significantly reduces household energy consumption. Controlling other factors constant, for a one-standard-deviation increase in the impact of AI, household energy consumption drops by an average of 10.751%. Robustness and endogeneity tests, including dealing with missing values, using different energy consumption and AI indicators, as well as applying instrumental variable method, placebo test and penalized regressions, confirm this conclusion. (2) Mechanism analysis shows that AI reduces energy consumption by lowering household income and increasing their financial fragility. (3) AI's impacts on different types of energy consumption are heterogeneous. Its negative effects are mainly observed in the significant reduction of electricity and gas consumption. Furthermore, it increases the probability of using solid fuels such as honeycomb coal, coal lumps, traditional biomass, etc., thereby increasing the reliance on low-grade energy resources and raising the risk of energy poverty. (4) AI has greater negative effects on those who do not have access to energy subsidies and households with poor energy security and stability, lower income and inadequate social security. Besides, its impacts on regions with higher levels of technological development are more prominent. (5) Feasible pathways to mitigate the adverse effects of AI are explored. It is found that improving labor protection can help alleviate its adverse consequences on energy consumption. This paper provides evidence on the impacts of technological disruption from a demand-based perspective. It highlights the need for better policies on energy, social security, income distribution and labor protection to weaken AI's effects on household energy consumption and prevent them from falling into energy poverty. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",2,10.1016/j.resourpol.2023.104469,"This paper systematically investigates the impact of AI application in the workforce on household energy consumption in China using empirical analysis from survey data.

"A stochastic programming model for a price-taking, profit-maximizing hydropower producer participating in the Nordic day-ahead and balancing market is developed and evaluated by backtesting over 200 historical days. We find that the producer may gain 0.07% by coordinating its trades in the day-ahead and balancing market, compared to considering the two markets sequentially. It is thus questionable whether a coordinated bidding strategy is worthwhile. However, the gain from coordinating trades is dependent on the quality of the forecasts for the balancing market. The limited gain of 0.07% comes from using an artificial neural network prediction model that is trained on historical data on seasonal effects, day-ahead market price, wind and temperature forecasts. To quantify the effect of the forecasting model on the gain of coordination, we therefore develop a benchmarking framework for two additional prediction models: a naive forecast predicting zero imbalance in expectation, and a perfect information forecast. Using the naive method, we estimate the lower bound of coordination to be 0.0% which coincides with theory. When having perfect information, we find that the upper bound for the gain is 3.8% which indicates that a substantial gain in profits can be obtained by coordinated bidding if accurate prediction methods could be developed. © 2021, The Author(s).",2,10.1007/s12667-021-00490-4,"This paper develops a stochastic programming model for a hydropower producer to evaluate the benefits of coordinated trading in day-ahead and balancing markets, using an artificial neural network for forecasting.

"Mineral extraction and use are vital to the world economy and industrial and energy industries. Environmental implications and the limited nature of many mineral resources have made mineral extraction sustainability a major issue. Deep learning and FinTech have provided creative answers to these problems in recent years. This presentation discusses the consequences of using deep learning-enabled FinTech solutions to identify minerals for sustainable natural resource extraction and use. Quantized deep learning for mineral identification during mining, using the widely used EfficientDet architecture, is proposed in this paper. We present a post-training quantization approach for the EfficientDet model that minimizes its size and complexity without compromising performance. We tested model efficiency with 8-bit and symmetric quantization. We also compare the quantized EfficientDet model to the floating-point model using a custom mineral dataset. The prescribed dataset gave the pre-train EfficientDet model 0.78 precision and 0.65 recall. The suggested model had 0.97 accuracy and 0.89 recall on the provided datasets. The suggested model is 99.5% accurate. Our results show that integrated FinTech technologies have enabled innovative financial models for ecologically friendly mineral extraction. By assessing environmental and social risks, FinTech platforms have helped investors assess mining project profitability. Investors may use this data to make informed judgments about sustainable development and ethical mining. Deep learning and FinTech mineral identification affects responsible natural resource development. These advancements enable environmentally and socially friendly mining.

"We systematically investigate the links between price returns and Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) scores in the European equity market. Using interpretable machine learning, we examine whether ESG scores can explain the part of price returns not accounted for by classic equity factors, especially the market one. We propose a cross-validation scheme with random company-wise validation to mitigate the relative initial lack of quantity and quality of ESG data, which allows us to use most of the latest and best data to both train and validate our models. Gradient boosting models successfully explain the part of annual price returns not accounted for by the market factor. We check with benchmark features that ESG data explain significantly better price returns than basic fundamental features alone. The most relevant ESG score encodes controversies. Finally, we find the opposite effects of better ESG scores on the price returns of small and large capitalization companies: better ESG scores are generally associated with larger price returns for the latter and reversely for the former. © 2023 by the authors.",2,10.3390/jrfm16030159,"This paper systematically investigates the relationship between ESG scores and price returns in the European equity market using interpretable machine learning techniques.

"In the context of the rapid development of artificial intelligence, industrial robots, as an important manifestation of artificial intelligence technology application, provide enterprises with a “creative destruction” environment, and play a positive role in energy utilization and environmental governance. Therefore, academics have focused a lot of attention on the question of whether industrial robot application can successfully improve corporate green innovation (CGI), thus achieving green transformation, and upgrading the manufacturing industry. This paper builds a “Bartik instrument variable” to calculate the micro-enterprise robot penetration rate from 2007 to 2019, looks at the effect of industrial robot application on CGI using data from manufacturing listed companies, and discusses the mechanism, heterogeneity, and robustness of this effect. The research finds that industrial robot application significantly improve CGI, indicating that they can promote corporate green technology transformation. This effect not only enhances the scale of CGI but also strengthens the quality of CGI. In addition, the above conclusion still holds after a series of endogeneity and robustness tests. Mechanism research shows that industrial robot application contribute to CGI by improving production efficiency, human capital, and environmental governance levels. It has a good complementary optimization effect on CGI. Furthermore, heterogeneity research shows that industrial robot application has a more significant role in enhancing green innovation for enterprises that are labor-intensive, more intense market competitive, more serious environmental pollution, and have lower level of digital economy development. The research conclusion verifies the effect of artificial intelligence technology and explores its mechanism, which provides empirical references for improving corporate environmental performance and green transformation. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.",2,10.1007/s10668-023-04225-6,"This paper investigates the impact of industrial robot application, as a manifestation of AI, on corporate green innovation using a Bartik instrument variable approach and data from manufacturing firms.

"Against the backdrop of urban sustainable development around the world, how to coordinate both economic growth and ecological benefits in urban space becomes an important problem. Therefore, this study simulated and predicted the spatiotemporal changes in urban economy and ecosystem service value (E.S.V.) equivalent ratio under the current policies by 2030, and analysed how adjusting planning policies influences economy and ecology. This process was based on the future land use simulation (F.L.U.S.) model of coupled neural network, and on methods assessing the spatial changes in ecosystem services and land economy. This study aims to analyse urban land economy and E.S.V., and assess how China’s land spatial planning guides and promotes high-quality urban economic development. Results show that artificial intelligence (A.I.) simulation can forecast the results of spatial planning policies of national lands, to make policy-making more forward-looking. The guidance of planning policies on urban expansion accelerates the increase in economic value of urban residential and commercial lands, thereby promoting the economic growth.

"The Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems have been widely employed in office buildings in China. However, these 24-hour running machines can result in plenty of unnecessary costs due to abundancies of cooling power created by extra power used. To cope with this scenario and maximize HVAC's running efficiency, this study builds prediction models with machine learning (ML) algorithms (including Gradient Boosting, Adaboost, and Random Forest) to optimize the existing systems with data derived from an office building in China. The goal of optimization is to attain the same of amount of cooling while less power is consumed, which is done by controlling the temperature setpoints to a more reasonable setting. With trained models, the results of optimization suggest a promising outcome that, for a single office building, at least ¥30156.40 could be saved annually, yielded by economic tools like Net Present Value (NPV), Life Cycle Cost Analysis (LCCA), and Social Carbon Cost (SCC).

"The COVID-19 pandemic caused profound impacts on the global economy, resulting in a sharp drop in carbon emissions as energy demand fell. The emissions reduction due to past extreme events often follows with a rebound after the economy recovers, but the pandemic’s impacts on the long-term carbon emissions trend remain unknown. This study forecasts the carbon emissions of Group of Seven (G7) as developed countries and Emerging Seven (E7) as developing countries using socioeconomic indicators and artificial intelligence-powered predictive analytics to assess the pandemic’s impacts on the long-term carbon trajectory curve and their progress toward achieving the Paris Agreement goals. Most E7’s carbon emissions have strong positive correlations (> 0.8) with the socioeconomic indicators, whereas most G7’s correlate negatively (> 0.6) due to their decoupled economic growth from carbon emissions. The forecasts show higher growth rates in the E7’s carbon emissions after the rebound in the pandemic scenario compared to the pandemic-free scenario, while the impact on the G7’s carbon emissions is negligible. The overall impact of the pandemic outbreak on long-term carbon emissions is small. Still, its short-term positive impact on the environment should not be misunderstood, and stringent emissions reduction policies must be implemented urgently to ensure the achievement of Paris Agreement goals.

"As a useful complement to traditional economic indicators, the Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare (ISEW) is best known for its merits in assessing environmental and social costs. Artificial intelligence (AI) is applied in virtually every area of society, the economy, and the environment. Given the significant impact of inequality in the development of AI on economic growth and sustainable economic welfare, we propose an improved ISEW, namely, AI-ISEW. This paper explores the AI-ISEW gap in China and its influencing factors in the context of uneven AI development. We calculate the ISEW and AI-ISEW for 30 provinces in mainland China from 2003 to 2019 and discuss highly controversial methodological assumptions related to income inequality, long-term environmental damage, and nonrenewable energy consumption. The Dagum Gini coefficient is used to reveal regional differences in AI-ISEW, kernel density estimation is used to describe the dynamic evolutionary trend of AI-ISEW development, and quadratic assignment procedure regression is used to explore the factors influencing the AI-ISEW gap. The study found that the AI-ISEW is on the rise, but its growth rate is generally lower than that of GDP. Compared to the AI-ISEW, the ISEW generally overestimates economic welfare. There are regional differences in China’s AI-ISEW, and the main source of differences is interregional differences. Regarding internal differences in each region, the average Gini coefficient from large to small displays the following order: east > west > central > northeast. Adjusted personal consumption is the greatest factor contributing to the AI-ISEW gap. The most economically developed regions have the greatest disparities in welfare.

"Scientific breakthroughs in recent years have earned widespread recognition. The significance of extenics has become so vital that the discipline is continuously evolving. Additionally, with the deployment of extenics and other innovations, the countries are now more connected and spatially reliant, influencing the global economy. The current study aims to investigate the role of extenics (measured by artificial intelligence (AI)) and spatial factors (measured by geopolitical risk (GPR)) in affecting the natural resources market (NRM). The analysis is performed on the Chinese economy data range from 1985 to 2022. The empirical assessment is carried out by using the unit root tests (Augmented Dickey fuller (ADF) and Phillips-Perron (PP) test), the non-linearity test (BDS test), and the non-linear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) model. The NARDL results show an asymmetric relationship between AI, GPR, and NRM in both the short run (SR) and long run (LR). A positive (negative) shock to AI, according to the findings, lowers (raises) natural resource rent and hence improves the natural resource market. Similarly, a positive (negative) shock to the GPR increases (decreases) natural resource rent and allows for the exploitation of the natural resource market.

"Fuel price caps are one of the potential regulatory tools for controlling wholesale electricity prices when fuel prices are volatile. In this paper, we introduce a theoretical model to study the effects of such caps on firms’ bidding behaviour and clearing prices in spot market auctions. We then use data from the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM), which recently implemented such caps, to empirically test and compare their effectiveness in three different states. Our theoretical findings suggest that fuel price caps can be binding, especially when electricity demand is lower and competition among generators is higher. When demand is high, alternative policy tools, such as market price caps, may be more effective in controlling auction prices. Our empirical analysis employs various techniques, such as Generalized Additive Models (GAM) and machine learning algorithms, to test the effectiveness of price caps in the NEM.

Results suggest that power sector CO2 emissions fell by 4.13 Million Tons (about 11.5%) during 2020 due to the pandemic, less than half of the actual year-on-year emissions reductions.

"Enhancing green total factor productivity is a fundamental in attaining sustainable development. Based on China's energy-consuming rights trading (ECRT), the study to examine its effect on firms' green total factor productivity (FGTFP) at the micro level is lacking. Meanwhile, it is also worth exploring what new opportunities the rapid development of the digital economy brings to ECRT. In this paper, we adopt the super-efficient EBM-GML model to measure FGTFP. On this basis, we assess the impact of ECRT on FGTFP by matching the data of A-share listed firms in China and provincial data from 2010 to 2019 while exploring the moderating effect of the digital economy. We reveal that ECRT significantly boosts FGTFP. This finding is supported by the synthetic control method, PSM-DID, the dual machine learning method, and other robustness testing methods. The mechanism analysis confirms that ECRT improves FGTFP mainly through three channels: promoting firms' green technological innovation, resolving firms' excess capacity, and alleviating firms' financial resource mismatch. The moderating effect emphasizes that the digital economy strengthens the contribution of ECRT to FGTFP. In addition, through heterogeneity analysis, we observe that the green development effect of ECRT is more prominent in the samples of state-owned enterprises, high energy-consuming firms, and firms with higher relocation costs. Meanwhile, we uncover that the positive moderating effect of the digital economy needs to be supported by the higher intensity of intellectual property protection and the level of digital infrastructure development in the region.

Specifically, we extract keywords related to ESG from whitepapers associated with each ICO using neural networks language models and build a variable which acts as a signal of attention to sustainability topics. Our research hypothesis concerns the evaluation of whether ICOs oriented towards ESG are more likely to successfully raise expected funds. Preliminary results confirm such a hypothesis. © 2023 The Author(s)",2,10.1016/j.frl.2023.104227,"This paper investigates the relationship between Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) indicators by analyzing ICO whitepapers using neural network language models.

"This study aims to address debate in previous studies on whether AI has a positive or negative effect on carbon emission reduction. We used quantile regression and PSTR models to study the diverse impacts of AI on carbon emissions in 66 countries from 1993–2019. There were three main findings in this paper. First, the impact of AI on carbon emissions varies across countries, and its effect on carbon reduction is mainly found in high-carbon emission and high-income countries. Second, the industrial structure environment of different countries affects the role of AI in carbon reduction, with its marginal effect in limiting emissions decreasing with the rise of secondary industrial structures. Third, the impact of AI varies in countries based on their different demographic structures. The marginal effect of AI on carbon emission reduction increases in places with older populations. This study offers unique insight into the heterogeneous impact of AI on CO2 emissions.

"In recent years, with a rise in climate change, the notion of sustainable development and resource productivity has received a lot of attention around the world. Meanwhile, advances in artificial intelligence based financial management and the creation of new blockchains or cryptocurrencies have transformed the day-to-day operations of economic actors. The aim of the present study is to investigate the impact of financial management and blockchains on environmental sustainability and resource productivity. The monthly time series data of the United States of America economy data is used covering the period from 2000M01–2022M09. Firstly, the stationary variable is tested using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller and Phillips-Perron tests. The findings reveal that all the variables follow I(1). The long-term estimations are investigated through the Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares. The findings reveal that artificial intelligence-based financial management helps to improve environmental sustainability and resource productivity by reducing carbon emissions and increasing combustible and renewable waste, metals, and non-metallic minerals resources in the long run. In addition, blockchain technology appears to be a booster for environmental unsustainability while also reducing metallic resources. These findings are particularly important and critical since they indicate the path to achieving Sustainable Development Goals.

"The 2060 carbon neutral target reflects the long-term equilibrium and stability of production activities and the natural environment. As an important part of Chinese energy structure, the operation and transformation of power enterprises will face higher requirements. Although the rapid development of smart grids provides necessary technical support for power enterprises to build a modern energy system with green power as the core, whether power enterprises can use smart grids to improve their operating performance and environmental performance has yet to be discussed. The differences caused by the heterogeneity of property rights will also have an impact on the green transformation and development of enterprises. This paper selects 25 Chinese power enterprises as the research objects and uses the 2011–2019 enterprise panel data and the data envelopment analysis model to evaluate the operating performance and environmental performance of power enterprises. The results show that the overall fluctuation trend of the total factor productivity index and green total factor productivity index of power enterprises are W-shaped, and technological progress is the main driving force for the improvement of power operating performance and environmental performance; Compared with enterprises with a single power generation method, enterprises with diversified power generation methods performed better in their overall total factor productivity index. After that, text mining and machine learning methods are used to classify the text of the enterprise’s annual report to determine whether the enterprise applies smart grid technology for production and operation activities. Finally, using feasible generalized least squares method (FLGS) and dynamic panel system generalized moment estimation (SYS-GMM) to analyze the impact of smart grid on the operating performance and environmental performance of power enterprises, and the nature of corporate property rights in this process.

"Artificial intelligence (AI) can revolutionize production process by improving energy efficiency, reducing costs, and developing green technology. Among the most important applications of AI technology, industrial robots are increasingly being used in production and have become significant feature of high-quality ecinomic development. Concerning this issue, this study uses the provincial panel data from China from 2010 to 2019 to explore how adopting industrial robots affects regional pollution emissions. We find that industrial robots significantly reduce the pollution emissions intensity in various provinces of China, and this conclusion holds following a series of robustness tests. Mechanism analysis shows that industrial robots reduce pollutant emissions intensity by improving energy efficiency and enhancing pollution reduction technologies. Heterogeneity analyses reveal that industrial robots significantly reduce pollution emissions intensity in the eastern and western regions of China, as well as in regions outside the Yangtze River Economic Belt, while this effect is significant for the central region and the Yangtze River Economic Belt. Industrial robots primarily promote pollution reduction in the eastern region, rather than enhancing regional energy efficiency. For the western region and regions outside the Yangtze River Economic Belt, the reduction in pollution emissions intensity appears to be attributable to both mechanisms. The above findings enrich the study on the impact of industrial robots on green production behavior and provide insights into pollution emissions control for some provinces of China. © 2024",2,10.1016/j.eneco.2024.107355,"This paper analyzes the impact of adopting industrial robots on regional pollution emissions in China, using provincial panel data and various robustness tests.

"The prevalence of energy poverty as a major challenge in numerous countries, the escalating energy crisis and the need to build just supporting mechanisms within the net zero energy transition add impetus to improving our ability to accurately predict energy vulnerable households. In Europe, this is hindered by limited recognition of the fact that energy vulnerable households are not necessarily income poor (and vice versa). Artificial Intelligence, and machine learning techniques in particular, may be applied to improve the targeting mechanism of energy poverty schemes, enabling accurate prediction of energy vulnerable households via objective, publicly available data. However, such applications are still limited, especially across a large number of countries. In response to the above, we develop an innovative machine learning framework for accurate prediction and fair targeting of energy poor households across all the current members of the European Union, and the United Kingdom. While we explore various machine learning algorithms, most of our analysis is performed using a Random Forest classifier. Our approach to explore energy poverty beyond income reveals household-level and country-level predictors of energy poverty, such as dwelling condition, energy efficiency, social protection payments and gas supplier switching rates. We also demonstrate how machine learning algorithms offer straightforward visualization of the mechanism that determines the energy poor classification, improving the transparency of alleviation schemes and assisting policy-makers in setting effective thresholds for assistance allocation. Finally, we evaluate the potential fairness of alleviation schemes and demonstrate that basing their targeting exclusively on income-relevant or social welfare-relevant criteria would be ineffective and result in significant numbers of energy poor households being excluded from energy assistance. © 2023 The Authors",2,10.1016/j.eneco.2023.107131,"This paper develops a machine learning framework to predict energy vulnerable households in the EU and UK, emphasizing the limitations of income-based targeting for energy poverty schemes.

"This study contributes to the existing literature by investigating and confirming a range of diverse outcomes related to the interplay of factors shaping the global energy transition (ET). Employing advanced methodologies, including the extension of the QVAR technique to short-term (SR), medium-term (MR), and long-term (LR) connectedness analysis, as well as the application of the CQ method to explore relationships within varying market conditions and timeframes, the study examines the interconnectedness of critical variables: artificial intelligence (AI), the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the Paris Agreement (PA), green technologies (GT), geopolitical risk (GPR), and ET. The findings highlight several crucial insights. Firstly, all selected variables demonstrate substantial interconnectedness across different time horizons, except for MR, which exhibits comparatively weaker connectedness than SR and LR. Secondly, independent series reveal diverse impacts on ET across various market conditions and periods. For example, in SR, most series produce mixed effects on ET, with BRI having primarily adverse consequences and GPR predominantly yielding positive impacts. In MR, the influence of AI, PA, and GT on ET varies, while BRI enhances ET, and GPR essentially hampers it. Notably, in LR, AI, BRI, PA, and GT significantly promote ET, while GPR disrupts its progress. Additionally, the study underscores the dynamic and time-varying nature of the relationships between AI, BRI, PA, GT, GPR, and ET across different market conditions, thus holding essential implications for shaping global policies to foster sustainable energy transitions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",2,10.1016/j.eneco.2024.107388,"This study investigates the interconnectedness of various factors influencing the global energy transition, including AI, using advanced methodologies to analyze their impacts over different time horizons.

"To explore the impact of city-renaming reform on economic growth, we compare the empirical performance of the synthetic control method, panel data approach and machine learning method (LASSO and elastic net) by the case of Xiangyang, which was officially renamed in 2010. We find that for the data on real GDP growth, the panel data approach reveals the best performance under the criteria of evaluating the quality of a model. The estimation results show that Xiangyang's real GDP growth rate rose by about 1.43% annually after the renaming reform. However, further discussions show that the annual growth rate of the tertiary industry decreased by 1.59%, which contradicts the mechanism of the brand effect of the reform. The statistical inference demonstrates that even if a city did not implement the city-renaming reform in 2010, the probability of obtaining an effect as large as Xiangyang's would be 25.9%. Therefore, the effect of the city-renaming reform is insignificant and other policy interventions—rather than the city-renaming reform—promote economic growth in Xiangyang.

"Amid the energy reform efforts by the Taiwan government, residential energy demand continues to face an escalating trend every year. This indicates the phenomenon of the energy efficiency gap. One of the factors that control the energy efficiency gap is the rebound effect. The rebound effect is related to the increase in energy consumption through efforts to reduce the use of energy itself. This can be due to the low cost of usage that causes a person to be encouraged to use more energy. This study aims to estimate the magnitude of the direct rebound effect of household electricity consumption in Taiwan using monthly time series data from January 1998 to December 2018 and to implement the artificial neural network (ANN) as an alternative approach to measure the direct rebound effect. Based on the simulation results, the direct rebound effect magnitude for household electricity consumption in Taiwan is in the range of 11.17% to 21.95%.

We look at the years between 2015 and 2022 and concentrate on a sustainable mining model that takes into consideration the economic, social, and environmental effects of mineral exploration by employing CS-ARDL model. Our study is based on an examination of the mining sector in the Asian region, which is expanding quickly and making the transition to a greener economy. We highlight five significant findings from our study. First, by delivering the minerals required for low-carbon and renewable energy technologies, mineral exploration may be a key component of the green transition. Second, in order to lessen its influence on the environment, the mining sector must embrace sustainable practices and technology. Third, for mining operations to be successful, community involvement and social permission to operate are essential.

"Contrary to much of the conventional wisdom, taking stronger actions on climate change may enhance economic growth, even as conventionally measured, but even more so, in terms of societal well-being. We identify the flaws in the models and analyses which contend that there must be a trade-off and explain the mechanisms and dynamic forces which have the potential to enhance growth. Critically, there are numerous market failures that result in suboptimal economic performance. We explain how addressing climate change reduces the bite of these failures and enhances the incentives and political will to address them. We identify packages of policies that alleviate market failures, enhance growth, and reduce carbon emissions.

"Many tropical reef fisheries are underperforming relative to maximum sustained yields despite their importance for the economies and food security of natural resource dependent people. Assessments of fisheries in tropical reefs have been hampered by the logistic difficulty and costs of making empirical estimates of sustainable yields in multi-species fisheries. To overcome this limitation, we used empirical fish biomass recovery data in high-compliance closures to create a production curve estimate that established biomass and yields at maximum sustained yield (Bmsy). A multivariate machine learning model using environmental and human influence proxies made biomass and yield estimates in 10,815 ∼6.25 km2 Indian Ocean cells. Subsequent analyses determined the national over- and under-fishing status. Identified proxies of travel time from markets, depth, and fisheries management were the main drivers of biomass and subsequent status. The East African countries of Kenya, Tanzania, and Mozambique had 18,500 km2 of reef and the lowest regional estimated biomass - losing 17,600 tons of commercial target fish per year. Therefore, the estimated loss is between US$ 50–150 million per year depending on the worth in the fisheries trade's value chain The more populated islands of Reunion, Mauritius, Mayotte, and Comoros have smaller areas (5000 km2) and losing 3000 tons/year, and >US$ 9 million per year.

"Sustainable exports value addition is extremely essential in contemporary economies as they provide individuals and businesses with numerous additional destinations for their products and serve as source of foreign exchange earnings. Mismanagement of natural resources is thought to be essential in growing natural resource curse and, as a result, decreasing the value addition of sustainable products, contributing to unsustainable development. Artificial intelligence, along with other factors, has emerged as a major driver of output and value addition. The present study investigates the asymmetric role of artificial intelligence and natural resource management on sustainable export value embedment over the period 1980–2020 for China's economy using the Non-linear Autoregressive Distributed Lag (NARDL) model. The results of the study validate the asymmetric association between artificial intelligence and sustainable export value addition. Similarly, an asymmetric relationship exists between natural resource management and the value of sustainable export. Further, the dynamic multiplier analysis advocates that the effect of negative shock in artificial intelligence is dominant whereas the impact of positive shock in natural resource management is influential on increasing sustainable export value addition. Therefore, our study concludes that policymaking on the assumption of concerned symmetric impacts is misleading.

"The proliferation of grid-connected converter interfaced energy sources in Smart Grids, enhance sustainability and efficiency as well as minimizing power losses and costs. However, concerns arise regarding the stability and reliability of future smart grids due to this wide integration of power electronic devices, which are recognized to affect the dynamic response of the system, especially during disturbances. For instance, apart from the lower damping of existing electromechanical modes, new low-frequency oscillations begin to appear. Yet, the ability of grid-connected converters to provide grid support functionalities can alleviate the aforementioned challenges. Relevant studies show that these functionalities can be enhanced even further, if information regarding the oscillation characteristics are available. Traditional methods for extracting modal information are very well suited for monitoring purposes, however, they pose certain limitations when considered for control applications. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-band intelligent power oscillation damper (MiPOD) that exploits 1) the inherent characteristics of grid-connected converters to damp multiple power oscillations and 2) the modeling capabilities of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for predicting the frequency of electromechanical oscillations in the system, as operating conditions change. Essentially, the MiPOD integrates the AI model in the control loop of the converter to attenuate multiple modes of oscillation. The proposed controller is validated for different disturbances and randomly generated operating points in the two area system. Specifically, in this case the AI model is a Random Forest ensemble regressor that is developed for tracking two electromechanical modes. As it is shown, the MiPOD can improve the overall performance of the system under various contingency scenarios with only 6% of the corresponding total nominal capacity of synchronous generators. In addition, the monitoring and damping abilities of the MiPOD are demonstrated for a vast range of operating points just by tuning two parameters; the predicted oscillation frequencies of the local and inter-area mode. © Copyright © 2021 Baltas, Lai, Tarraso, Marin, Blaabjerg and Rodriguez.",2,10.3389/fenrg.2021.598436,This paper proposes a multi-band intelligent power oscillation damper (MiPOD) that utilizes AI to predict electromechanical oscillation frequencies and enhance the damping of power oscillations in smart grids.

"The policy design of carbon dioxide (CO2) emission mitigation is a hotly debated topic in the context of “Carbon Peak and Carbon Neutrality” in China. This paper contributes to this debate by employing an unsupervised machine learning algorithm to uncover the CO2 emission typology based on the provincial emission data in China from 2000 to 2018 for a precise design of CO2 emission mitigation policy for heterogenous regional patterns. The results indicate that we can cluster the provinces into four CO2 emission patterns: the under-developed pattern, the coal-dominated pattern, the oil-dominated pattern, and the gas-dominated pattern. Notably, both the under-developed pattern and the coal-dominated pattern have a large amount of CO2 emission from fossil fuels, while the gas-dominated pattern could be regarded as the policy inclination as it relies more on low-carbon fuels. Moreover, we also reveal the transition routes of emission patterns from a dynamic perspective, which could help policymakers better understand the future trend of emission patterns in different regions. On the one hand, the CO2 emission mitigation policies could have specified priorities in different patterns, ensuring the feasibility during the process of policy implementation. On the other hand, establishing a national unified carbon trade market could facilitate efficient energy transition in China, and prevent carbon leakage cross different regions as well. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",2,10.1016/j.chieco.2023.101941,This paper utilizes an unsupervised machine learning algorithm to classify CO2 emission patterns across Chinese provinces and inform targeted emission mitigation policies.

"Purpose: This paper aims to develop a forecasting tool for the automatic assessment of both environmental and economic benefits resulting from low-carbon investments in the real estate sector, especially when applied in large building stocks. A set of four artificial neural networks (NNs) is created to provide a fast and reliable estimate of the energy consumption in buildings due to heating, hot water, cooling and electricity, depending on some specific buildings’ characteristics, such as geometry, orientation, climate or technologies. Design/methodology/approach: The assessment of the building’s energy demand is performed comparing the as-is status (pre-retrofit) against the design option (post-retrofit). The authors associate with the retrofit investment the energy saved per year, and the net monetary saving obtained over the whole cost after a predetermined timeframe. The authors used a NN approach, which is able to forecast the buildings’ energy demand due to heating, hot water, cooling and electricity, both in the as-is and in the design stages. The design stage is the result of a multiple attribute optimization process. Findings: The approach here developed offers the opportunity to manage energy retrofit interventions on wide property portfolios, where it is necessary to handle simultaneously a large number of buildings without it being technically feasible to achieve a very detailed level of analysis for every property of a large portfolio. Originality/value: Among the major accomplishments of this research, there is the creation of a methodology that is not excessively data demanding: the collection of data for building energy simulations is, in fact, extremely time-consuming and expensive, and this NN model may help in overcoming this problem. Another important result achieved in this study is the flexibility of the model developed. The case study the authors analysed was referred to one specific stock, but the results obtained have a more widespread importance because it ends up being only a matter of input-data entering, while the model is perfectly exportable in other contexts. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",2,10.1108/JERER-12-2019-0054,"This paper develops a forecasting tool using artificial neural networks to assess the environmental and economic benefits of low-carbon investments in the real estate sector, focusing on energy consumption in buildings.

"ESG (Environmental, social and governance) alpha strategy that makes sustainable investment has gained popularity among investors. The ESG fields of study in scholar big data is a valuable alternative data that reflects a company's long-term ESG commitment. However, it is considered a difficulty to quantitatively measure a company's ESG premium and its impact to the company's stock price using scholar big data. In this paper, we utilize ESG scholar data as alternative data to develop an automatic trading strategy and propose a practical machine learning approach to quantify the ESG premium of a company and capture the ESG alpha. First, we construct our ESG investment universe and apply feature engineering on the companies' ESG scholar data from the Microsoft Academic Graph database. Then, we train six complementary machine learning models using a combination of financial indicators and ESG scholar data features and employ an ensemble method to predict stock prices and automatically set up portfolio allocation. Finally, we manage our portfolio, trade and rebalance the portfolio allocation monthly using predicted stock prices. We backtest our ESG alpha strategy and compare its performance with benchmarks. The proposed ESG alpha strategy achieves a cumulative return of 2,154.4% during the backtesting period of ten years, which significantly outperforms the NASDAQ-100 index's 397.4% and S&P 500's 226.9%.

"The acceleration of digital technology development is an important strategic choice to realize the transformation of green innovation. Prior research focuses on the mechanism by which artificial intelligence technology promotes economic growth but ignores the impact of digital technology on green innovation performance. Using panel data on 30 regions in China from 2003 to 2019, this paper examines the impact of digital technology on green innovation performance. The results are as follows: (1) Digital technology can significantly promote green innovation performance. After a series of robustness tests, the conclusion is still valid. (2) Digital technology improves green innovation performance through the green technology upgrading effect, cost reduction effect, and green resource allocation optimization effect. (3) Heterogeneity test results show that in regions with high human capital, high R&D intensity, and strong environmental regulation, the improvement effect of digital technology on green innovation performance is more obvious. These findings not only enrich the literature on digital technology and green innovation performance but also serve as a reference for governmental departments as they optimize their strategy for developing digital technology and achieving green economic development. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.",2,10.1007/s13132-023-01410-w,This paper investigates the impact of digital technology on green innovation performance using panel data from 30 regions in China.

"The problem of unbalanced energy development in China still exists. How to adjust the energy structure is the key to high-quality economic development in China. This paper analyses the impact of regional energy development levels on high-quality economic development in China from 2016 to 2017, with the global ML methodology and structural equation model. Firstly, from two aspects of environmental and technological factors, the Global Malmquist-Luenberger (GML) production function is used to measure the environmental endowment index of regional energy development in China. Secondly, the evaluation system of China’s energy development is established. The structural equation model is used to measure and evaluate the degree of China’s regional energy development. Combined with the environmental endowment index of regional energy development, the gap between the proportion of regional renewable energy and the optimal energy structure is analyzed. Thirdly, this paper explores the supporting effect of different energy development levels on high-quality economic development. It is concluded that the environmental endowment index of energy development varies among different regions in China, most of which are still underdeveloped, but a few of which have redundant technical elements of renewable energy development. China’s regional energy development model is still dominated by fossil fuel energy, and the proportion of renewable energy driving economic growth is relatively low. Renewable energy can effectively replace the use of fossil fuel energy and have a higher impact on high-quality economic development. Finally, on the basis of the above study, the paper puts forward policy suggestions for Chinese governments to adjust energy structure and promote high-quality economic development. © Copyright © 2021 Liu, Fan, Hong and Chen.",2,10.3389/fenrg.2021.635570,"This paper analyzes the impact of regional energy development levels on high-quality economic development in China using a global machine learning methodology and structural equation modeling.

"By 2025, Belgium will phase-out nuclear power. Unassessed so far, this policy reform may modify the economic and environmental channels through which energy and society interfere in this country. In this paper, we investigate whether this structural energy change may adversely impact the growth of the Belgian economy (i) and its ability to meet its long-term greenhouse gas emission targets (ii). A multivariate model comprising production factors (labor, capital, and exports), nuclear and renewable energy uses, total primary energy supply, economic growth, and CO2 emissions from the power and heating sector is combined with real time-series data spanning the 1974–2019 period. The analysis consists in sequentially assessing two distinct nexuses (energy-economy and energy-economy-environment) over reduced- and augmented frameworks (excluding and including nuclear energy), and through a two-stage empirical strategy: time-series econometric estimations (Toda-Yamamoto causality test, Impulse Response Functions (IRFs), and the Auto-Regressive Distributed Lags (ARDL) and Machine Learning (ML) experiments with a Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) algorithm. For robustness purposes, we conduct two seminal tests which relate to dynamic predictive processes (T-Mat and Verticality tests). Besides confirming the time-series findings, our ML results highlight the necessity to timely manage the process of nuclear phase-out, along with a progressive deployment of installed renewable energy capacity. This should avoid additional economic costs, energy security threats, and undermining of climate targets.

"Probing the essential role of artificial intelligence in the energy market is crucial to improving the development of renewable energy. The research adopts the full and sub sample methodologies to identify the interrelation of artificial intelligence index (AII) and renewable energy indicator (REI) in China. From the quantitative discussions, it is shown that there are favourable and negative impacts from AII to REI, and the positive ones indicate that artificial intelligence plays an incentive role in developing renewable energy. However, this incentive role cannot permanently be established if AII's effect on REI is negative, which is mainly caused by non-renewable energy with less costs. In turn, there is a favourable influence from REI to AII during COVID-19, highlighting that the downturn in renewable energy and stock markets caused by this epidemic impedes the progress of artificial intelligence in China.

"The goal of this paper is to prove the necessity for a more thorough consideration and more active use of the modern ICTs for the technological support for the practical implementation of the SDGs’ ecological block in the aspect of the increase of energy efficiency and environmental pollution control. The originality of this paper is as follows: it develops a proprietary methodology of evaluating the technical readiness (level of the development of ICTs) for implementing the ecological block of the SDGs, which envisage the increase of energy efficiency and the growth of environmental pollution control. The highest (but moderate) technological readiness to implement the ecological block of the SDGs among developed countries has been shown by Canada (14.42 points) and Denmark (11.03 points), among developing countries—China (7.72 points). As a result, it has been proved that UCTs are a perspective tool of the practical implementation of the ecological block of the SDGs, stimulating the increase of energy efficiency and improving the environment pollution control. For developed countries, it is recommended to increase the use of Big data and AI analytics by 90.36% and increase the use of ICTs in E-government by 89.74%. This will allow achieving the growth of energy efficiency by 8.28% and the decrease of environmental pollution by 28.41%.

"Existing research suggests that the application of artificial intelligence (AI) technology in industrial fields can promote the development of a green economy. However, for most developing countries, due to imperfect technological capabilities, human capital constraints and other factors, the impact of industrial intelligence on the green economy still needs to be verified. Based on city panel data from China, we find that industrial intelligence has no significant impact on green total factor productivity (GTFP). This conclusion is still valid after GMM estimation, instrumental variable (IV) estimation and a series of robustness tests. After incorporating the environmental regulation into the analysis framework, the impact of industrial intelligence on GTFP is found to be regulated by the intensity of the environmental regulation; that is, industrial intelligence can improve GTFP only in cities with strong environmental regulation. Further research shows that industrial intelligence can optimize and upgrade the industrial structure, given strict environmental regulations, thereby improving city GTFP. We confirm that the institutional premise of environmental regulation in developing countries is indispensable for industrial intelligence to promote the green economy, which has important theoretical and practical significance. © 2023",2,10.1016/j.ecolecon.2023.108021,"This paper analyzes the impact of industrial intelligence (AI) on green total factor productivity in Chinese cities, using panel data and various estimation methods.

"Many countries have phased out nuclear power in response to concerns about nuclear waste and the risk of nuclear accidents. This paper examines the shutdown of more than half of the nuclear production capacity in Germany after the Fukushima accident in 2011. We use hourly data on power plant operations and a machine learning approach to estimate the impacts of the phase-out policy. We find that reductions in nuclear electricity production were offset primarily by increases in coal-fired production and net electricity imports. Our estimates of the social cost of the phase-out range from €3 to €8 billion per year. The majority of this cost comes from the increased mortality risk associated with exposure to the local air pollution emitted when burning fossil fuels. Policymakers would have to significantly overestimate the risk or cost of a nuclear accident to conclude that the benefits of the phase-out exceed its social costs. We discuss the likely role of behavioral biases in this setting, and highlight the importance of ensuring that policymakers and the public are informed about the health effects of local air pollution.  © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.

"Research background:The twin pressures of economic downturn and climate change faced by countries around the world have become more pronounced over the past decade. A renewable energy transition is believed to play a central role in mitigating the economic-climate paradox. While the architectural and computational power of artificial intelligence is particu larly well suited to address the challenges of massive data processing and demand forecasting during a renewable energy transition, there is very scant empirical assessment that takes a social science perspective and explores the effects of AI development on the energy transition. Purpose of the article: This paper aims to answer two key questions: One is, how does AI software development promote or inhibit the shift of energy consumption towards renewables? The other is, under what policy interventions does AI software development have a more positive effect on promoting renewable energy consumption? Methods: We employ a dataset of 62 economies covering the period 2011–2020 to analyze the impact of AI software development on the energy transition, where possible confounders, including political and economic characteristics and time-invariant elements, are controlled using fixed-effects estimation along with specified covariates. Findings & value added: AI software development can promote the energy transition towards renewables. There is suggestive evidence that the core mechanism linking such a positive relationship tends to lie in improving innovation performance in environmental monitoring rather than in green computing. Government support for R&D in renewable energy technologies is found to be significantly beneficial for harnessing the positive impact of AI software development on the energy transition.

"In recent years, with a rise in climate change, the notion of natural resource managementhas received much attention worldwide. The heavy reliance of both developed and developing economies on mineral resource management (MRM) is an important aspect of the debate.Meanwhile, advances in artificial intelligence (AI)-based financial management (FM) have transformed the day-to-day operations and management prospects of ecological resources. The present research examines the relationship between AI-based FMand MRM.The study has been done for the economy of the United States of America (USA) and the time ranges from the year 1980–2020.Firstly, the stationarity of the variables are checked using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF),Phillips-Perron (PP)and Kwiatkowski–Phillips–Schmidt–Shin (KPSS) tests.The findings reveal that all the variables follow I(1). The BDS testing is employed for checking the non-linearity among the variables under consideration. The results verify the presence of nonlinearity. Then, the non-linear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) approach is used to find the asymmetric effect of FM on mineral resource rent(MRR). The findings provide evidence of an asymmetric relationship between FM and MRR. Such that the positive shock of FM is negatively related to MRR while a negative shock is positively related to MRR. Based on findings, the study suggests that the USA economy must redesign its mineral resource strategy to establish AI-based financial systems for improving MRM by assuring worker safety and efficiency in the mining industry, resulting in long-term growth. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",2,10.1016/j.resourpol.2023.103323,"This paper investigates the relationship between AI-based financial management and mineral resource management in the USA from 1980 to 2020, employing various statistical tests and a non-linear autoregressive distributed lag approach.

"Improving carbon emission efficiency is essential to address climate change. The widely used methods of modelling heterogeneity in efficiency evaluation tend to artificially classify groups based on a single variable and thus result in biased estimation. To fill this knowledge gap, this paper proposes a new method that combines machine learning and radial directional distance function (DDF) to estimate carbon emission efficiency and reduction potential, in which heterogeneity could be grouped endogenously. Furthermore, index decomposition analysis (IDA) is incorporated to explore the dynamic determinants of carbon emission reduction potential. Using China's data at city level from 2010 to 2018, we found that carbon emission efficiency considering technology heterogeneity is between 0.569–0.822. This implies an excellent emission reduction potential of around 5.9 million tons in 2018. The reduction potential is attributable to managerial failure and technology gap—the latter accounts for 46–55% of the total reduction potential. We arguably conclude that the method in this paper can capture each city's economic and environmental information more accurately than previous methods based on geographic grouping, which may underestimate the reduction potential. We anticipate the machine learning method in this paper could provide insights on clustering the technological heterogeneity and efficiency evaluation. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",2,10.1016/j.eneco.2022.106238,"This paper proposes a novel method combining machine learning and radial directional distance function to evaluate carbon emission efficiency while accounting for technological heterogeneity.

"While carbon taxes are generally seen as a rational policy response to climate change, knowledge about their performance from an ex-post perspective is still limited. This paper analyzes the emissions and cost impacts of the UK CPS, a carbon tax levied on all fossil-fired power plants. To overcome the problem of a missing control group, we propose a policy evaluation approach which leverages economic theory and machine learning for counterfactual prediction. Our results indicate that in the period 2013–2016 the CPS lowered emissions by 6.2 percent at an average cost of €18 per ton. We find substantial temporal heterogeneity in tax-induced impacts which stems from variation in relative fuel prices.

"As a strategic technology, artificial intelligence is leading a new round of technological revolution and industrial upgrading that plays an essential role in cultivating emerging industries. This paper employs robot application data compiled by the IFR (International Federation of Robotics) and Chinese firm-level data to empirically investigate the impact of artificial intelligence applications on the energy and resource efficiency of firms. From 2005 to 2014, the energy efficiency of industrial enterprises had an upward trend, and the level of artificial intelligence showed a significant increase in China.

"Corporations have come under pressure from investors and other stakeholders to disclose and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). Corporate GHG footprints, proxying for transition risk, are dominated by carbon emissions from energy use. Thus the growing attention on the carbon emissions of corporations from, principally, their energy use, motivates firms to invest in energy efficiency and renewable energy. However, only a subset of corporations disclose their GHG/carbon footprints. This paper uses machine learning to improve the prediction of corporate carbon emissions for risk analyses by investors. We introduce a two-step framework that applies a Meta-Elastic Net learner to combine predictions from multiple base-learners as the best emission prediction approach. It results in an accuracy gain based on mean absolute error of up to 30% as compared with the existing models.

"Artificial intelligence (AI) is set to greatly enhance the productivity and efficiency of global supply chains over the next decade. Transnational corporations are hailing these gains as a ‘game changer’ for advancing environmental sustainability. Yet, looking through a political economy lens, it is clear that AI is not advancing sustainability nearly as much as industry leaders are claiming. As this article argues, the metrics and rhetoric of corporate social responsibility are exaggerating the benefits and obscuring the costs of AI. Productivity and efficiency gains in the middle sections of supply chains are rebounding into more production and consumption, doing far more to enhance the profitability of big business than the sustainability of the earth. At the same time, AI is accelerating natural resource extraction and the distancing of waste, casting dark shadows of harm across marginalized communities, fragile ecosystems, and future generations. The micro-level gains from AI, as this article exposes, are not going to add up to macro-level solutions for the negative environmental consequences of global supply chains, while portraying AI as a force of sustainability is legitimizing business as usual, reinforcing a narrative of corporate responsibility, obfuscating the need for greater state regulation, and empowering transnational corporations as global governors.

"The continued development of artificial intelligence (AI) has changed production methods but may also pose challenges related to energy consumption; in addition, the effectiveness of AI differs across industries. Thus, to develop efficient policies, it is necessary to discuss the effect of AI adoption on energy intensity and to identify industries that are more significantly affected. Using data on industrial robots installed in 16 Chinese industrial subsectors from 2006 to 2016, this paper investigates both the effect of AI on energy intensity and the channel through which this effect is transmitted. The empirical results show, first, that boosting applications of AI can significantly reduce energy intensity by both increasing output value and reducing energy consumption, especially for energy intensities at high quantiles. Second, compared with the impacts in capital-intensive sectors (e.g., basic metals, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics), the negative impacts of AI on energy intensity in labor-intensive sectors (e.g., textiles and paper) and technology-intensive sectors (e.g., industrial machinery and transportation equipment) are more pronounced. Finally, the impact of AI on energy intensity is primarily achieved through its facilitation of technological progress; this accounts for 78.3% of the total effect.

"Responsible natural resource management has become critical for ensuring the effective use of resources jeopardizing future generations' needs. Financialization based on artificial intelligence, green finance, and lower economic risks are important in this respect. The objective of this study is to explore the impact of financialization and economic uncertainty on the natural resource market. The analysis covers the period from 1980 to 2021 and is performed for selected South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) countries. In addition, among economic financialization processes, artificial intelligence (AI) based financial management (FM) is more significant than domestic financialization strategies. For that purpose, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) method and pooled regression analysis are employed for the empirical analysis. According to the findings, economic uncertainty has a stronger influence than economic financialization. Therefore, risk mitigation plays a larger role in creating shocks in all macroeconomic indicators and, as a result, on the natural resource market. The accuracy measures to support the finding's robustness like the value of R2 is highly acceptable and errors are minimum (% MAPE is 5.06 which falls under the criteria of high accuracy) in both testing and training datasets approximately by 50%.

The research findings indicate that AI has the capability to effectively mitigate corporate carbon emissions (CCE) and enhance the level of green innovation (GI) in enterprises. Mechanism analysis reveals that energy consumption plays a mediating role in the relationship between AI and CCE. Heterogeneity analysis reveals that the inhibitory effect of AI on CCE is more pronounced in private enterprises and non-heavy polluting industries. However, the impact of AI on GI is greater in state-owned enterprises and heavy-polluting industries. This study sheds light on the influence of AI on the green and low-carbon transformation of enterprises, as well as its transmission mechanisms. It provides theoretical and empirical insights for promoting GI, reducing emissions, and improving energy efficiency in enterprises. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",2,10.1002/mde.4164,"This paper investigates the impact of AI on corporate carbon emissions and green innovation in enterprises, utilizing a sample of listed companies in China.

"Green consumption (GC) is an unavoidable choice for mitigating environmental pressures, achieving the “double carbon goal”, and promoting the development of a low-carbon, green society as a whole. With the rapid advancement of digitization (Digi), artificial intelligence, big data, and other associated digital technologies have become powerful driving forces for GC from both the supply and demand perspectives. Therefore, a spatial Durbin model (SDM) was utilized to investigate the local and spatial spillover impacts of Digi on GC based on panel data from 2011 to 2020 from 30 Chinese provinces. It was found that: (1) Digi can influence both the supply and demand aspects of green products, establishing a positive correlation with local GC. It also exerted a favorable incentive effect on GC in neighboring provinces through spatial connections and spatial spillover, within the framework of the imitation mechanism. Several robustness tests revealed that the effects remained significant. (2) the enhanced market mechanisms and a favorable competitive environment offered by the high-level market, in addition to the subsidy and incentive mechanisms within the government's Green Consumption Policy (GCP), were instrumental in fostering the development of GC. Consequently, the government's role in “promotion” and the market's role in “pull” had a regulating effect on the impact of Digi on GC. (3) heterogeneity analysis illustrated that Digi had a more significant promoting effect on GC in the comprehensive big data pilot and large-scale industrial digitization areas. Based on this, we suggest that the state increase investment in Digi to provide a foundation for the research and development of green digital technologies. Additionally, the state should promote the construction and improvement of green consumer markets and formulate more incentive or penalty systems conducive to promoting GC. The research results also provide a theoretical basis for the direct and dynamic effects of Digi, as well as inspiration for promoting GC and green sustainable development. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",2,10.1016/j.jretconser.2024.103843,This paper investigates the impact of digitization on green consumption using a spatial Durbin model with panel data from Chinese provinces.

"Purpose: With the growing concern of various sectors of society regarding environmental issues and the promotion of sustainable development, green technology innovation is generally considered to be conducive to the long-term development of enterprises. However, because of the existence of agency problems, managers may have shortsighted behaviors. Then how will managers' shortsighted behaviors affect enterprises' green technology innovation? Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses machine learning-based text analysis methods to construct a manager myopia index based on the data from A-share listed companies on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges from 2015 to 2020. We examine the impact of manager myopia on green technology innovation in companies. Findings: Our study finds that manager myopia significantly inhibits green technology innovation in companies. However, when multiple large shareholders coexist and the proportion of institutional investors' holdings is high, it can alleviate the inhibitory effect of manager myopia on green innovation. Heterogeneity tests show that the impact of manager myopia on green technology innovation is relatively significant in non-state-owned and manufacturing companies, as well as in the electricity industry. Robustness tests demonstrate that our conclusions remain valid after using propensity score matching to eliminate endogeneity problems. Originality/value: From the perspective of corporate governance, this paper incorporates managers' shortsightedness, multiple large shareholders and institutional investors' shareholding ratios into the same logical framework, analyzes their internal mechanisms, helps improve corporate governance, enhances green innovation capabilities and has strong implications for the implementation of national innovation-driven development strategies and the achievement of “carbon peak” and “carbon neutrality” targets. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.",2,10.1108/MD-06-2023-0891,"This paper investigates the impact of managerial shortsightedness on green technology innovation using machine learning-based text analysis to construct a myopia index from firm-level data.

"We explore if mandated Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) spending encourages tax aggressiveness in firms. We use actual CSR spending amounts instead of CSR proxy scores and consider India, which has mandated CSR spending regulation, as opposed to voluntary CSR regimes in existing works. As an outlying feature, we use the Conditional Inference Tree (CIT), a machine learning approach, uniquely to gain insights into the relationship and check the robustness of standard regression analysis outcomes. We find that tax aggressiveness is negatively associated with CSR spending (characterized by CSR spending growth) and positively influenced by other factors, like a greater focus on investors and higher returns. Our findings indicate that socially responsible companies with increased CSR spending are less likely to demonstrate tax aggressiveness even in a mandatory CSR regime. The finding that firms’ earnings manipulation influences tax aggressiveness is also a prominent contribution of our study. © 2024",2,10.1016/j.jclepro.2024.142140,This paper investigates the relationship between mandated CSR spending and tax aggressiveness in firms using actual spending data and a machine learning approach (Conditional Inference Tree) to analyze the data.

"With the Group of 20 (G20) incorporating climate actions into recovery plans, the post-COVID period presents a unique opportunity for green economy. Nevertheless, reporting on future short-term fossil carbon emissions has been constrained due to delays in parameterizing complex energy models. This study aimed to develop a novel approach, utilizing machine learning algorithms, to estimate fossil carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 2030 without the need for intricate energy modeling. Our analysis revealed that the machine learning approach performed effectively, and the post-pandemic CO2 emissions are predicted to be 10.1 %–17.7 % lower than the pre-pandemic projections. However, this reduction still falls significantly short of the abatement requirement for the 1.5 °C Paris Agreement climate target.

"The Pearl River Delta (PRD) has high concentrations of energy consumption and carbon emissions, and the conflict between its economic development and environmental protection is relatively prominent. Beginning from the ideal path of economic growth, this study proposes a framework for carbon emission prediction under the optimal economic growth path of the PRD via the cross-analysis of low-carbon economic analysis and artificial intelligence prediction. First, the generalized Divisia index method (GDIM) is used to decompose carbon emissions to quantify the contribution rate of each influencing factor. Then, the genetic algorithm (GA) is introduced to optimize the backpropagation (BP) neural network to construct a GA-BP combined prediction model. Finally, the optimal economic growth rate models under different scenarios are constructed, and the carbon peak in the PRD under stable economic growth is accurately predicted. The results show that under the optimal economic growth path, the carbon peak in the PRD under the scenario with carbon constraints will be reached in 2029, while that under the scenario without carbon constraints will only begin to appear around 2035. Thus, the achievement of the carbon peak target in the PRD still requires insisting on stringent carbon emission reduction measures. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",2,10.1016/j.jclepro.2024.140879,"This paper develops a framework for predicting carbon emissions in the Pearl River Delta using a combination of low-carbon economic analysis and AI techniques, specifically a GA-BP neural network model.

"Effectively modeling carbon prices while maintaining interpretability is essential, given the potential risks associated with unexpected price fluctuations. To this end, this study proposes an explainable machine learning (XML) framework to predict and explain carbon prices in China's three representative carbon markets: Shenzhen, Hubei, and Beijing. Leveraging the strengths of tree-based machine learning models and Tree SHAP algorithms, we unveil global and local explanations in the driving patterns of carbon prices. Our findings indicate that the distribution of local explanatory effects exhibits asymmetric and long-tailed characteristics. Notably, the top global drivers in Shenzhen, Hubei, and Beijing are the photovoltaic price index, coal prices, and the industrial added value of electricity sectors, respectively. Furthermore, we uncover the nonlinear impacts of key drivers on individual carbon price predictions, and identify three key interaction patterns through the calculation of SHAP interaction values. Lastly, we evaluate the explainable performance of various XML benchmarks to validate the superiority of our XML framework, as well as demonstrate its economic significance via a switching trading strategy.

"The concept of smart cities revolves around utilizing modern technologies to manage and optimize city operations, including energy infrastructure. One of the biggest problems that smart cities have to deal with is ensuring the efficient usage of energy infrastructure to reduce energy consumption, cost, and environmental impact. Machine learning is a powerful tool that can be utilized to optimize energy usage in smart cities. This paper proposes a framework for efficient usage of energy machine learning for city infrastructure in smart cities. The proposed framework includes three main components: data collection, machine learning model development, and energy infrastructure optimization. The data collection component involves collecting energy consumption data from various sources, such as smart meters, sensors, and other IoT devices. The collected data is then pre-processed and cleaned to remove any inconsistencies or errors. The machine learning model development component involves developing machine learning models to predict energy consumption and optimize energy usage. The models can be developed using various techniques such as regression, classification, clustering, and deep learning. These models can predict energy consumption patterns based on historical data, weather conditions, time of day, and other factors. The energy infrastructure optimization component involves utilizing the machine learning models to optimize energy usage. The optimization process involves adjusting energy supply and demand to reduce energy consumption and cost. The optimization process can be automated, and SVM based machine learning models can continuously enhance their precision over time by studying the data. The proposed framework has several benefits, including reducing energy consumption, cost, and environmental impact. It can also improve the reliability and stability of energy infrastructure, reduce the risk of blackouts, and improve the overall quality of life in highly developed urban areas. Last but not least, the projected framework for efficient usage of energy machine learning for city infrastructure in smart cities is a promising solution to optimize energy usage and reduce energy consumption and cost.

"Assessing and comprehending the social impact of firms at global and local level is a pressing concern for both researchers and policy-makers. To address this concern, our paper contributes to the stream of literature that studies the content of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) reports (which are also referred to as non-financial statements, sustainability reports or parts of annual reports) using text mining methods. We present a novel approach called Standard-based Impact Classification method (SBIC method), which employs natural language processing (NLP) and supervised machine learning techniques to identify the types of social impacts reflected in CSR reports. We deploy a Random Forest model which we train on reports adhering to Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) framework, enabling the identification of social impact in the majority of CSR reports that do not conform to this standard. Our proposed SBIC method serves as a valuable tool for comparing the social impacts generated by firms, industries, or countries. We showcase an application of our approach by examining the relationship between a company's social impact and its innovation capacity. Our findings support the existing literature consensus that CSR activities generally exhibit a positive correlation with a firm's ability to innovate.

"Most African countries have developed their economies without causing large-scale ecological damage, yet they face severe challenges from global climate change and COVID-19 epidemic. To address this paradox, explainable machine learning coupled with panel data models are proposed to examine the different performances of Cameroon, Zimbabwe, Ghana, and Eritrea in terms of environmental sustainability measured by visibility. The results show that all countries except Zimbabwe have inverted N-shaped Environmental Kuznets Curves (EKCs), suggesting that the economic development works against environmental sustainability. Based on the modified TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution), Cameroon's environmental sustainability performance is particularly poor, while Eritrea's is better. Meanwhile, Eritrea is not exogenously threatened by epidemics, while Cameroon and Ghana are. By integrating the multidimensional Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) achievement pathway assessment system, Zimbabwe may be moving towards green growth. More importantly, the Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) technique is applied to quantify and visualize the socio-economic drivers of environmental sustainability. The results depict that, in addition to meteorological drivers, per capita income plays a leading role.

"With the increasing attention paid to environmental protection and sustainable development in various countries worldwide, the relationship between local government competition and environmental governance has become more subtle and complex. This paper provides new insight into their relationship based on public value theory and media sentiment perspective. Utilizing panel data from 2012 to 2019 in 216 cities in China, this study integrated Data Envelopment Analysis, Conflicting Attitudes Model, Computer-Aided Text Analysis, and machine learning-based sentiment analysis, as well as nonlinear mediation model to empirically test the relationships among local governments’ competition pressure, public value conflict, media sentiments, and environmental governance performance. The study found that: (1) Competition pressure and environmental governance performance exist in a “U-curved” relationship. (2) The core mechanism of the above relationship lies in the mediating role of public value conflict. Within a specific range, the public value conflict faced by local governments increases as competition pressure increases. This conflict would push local governments into a dilemma and induce them to commit misconduct. However, when competition pressure exceeds this range, the public value conflict faced by local governments will be weakened, leading environmental governance performance to rebound. (3) Negative media sentiments significantly alleviate the negative impact of public value conflict on environmental governance performance. This study helps researchers and policymakers recognize government competition’s influence on environmental governance from a public value perspective, with further exploration and confirmation of the moderating role of media sentiments.

"One of the main roles of the transmission system operators (TSOs) is to predict and plan the procurement of the active power losses in transmission systems. TSO can reduce operating cost using power losses forecasts and, in principle, the higher the power losses forecast accuracy is the lower are the TSO's operating cost. The paper continuous on our previous work where we describe the newly designed machine learning based tool forecasting power losses that has been implemented at the Croatian TSO. After more than a year of continuous everyday operation of the tool we now evaluate its real world performance and use its results in further analysis. To reap the benefits of accurate power losses forecast, the TSO has to choose a good strategy for procurement of those losses on the electricity markets. In this work we present an analysis of hypothetical procurement strategies. Electricity markets that consider in the analysis are Croatian day-ahead, intraday and balancing markets. The baseline procurement strategies are procurement on single markets, while advanced strategies combine all three markets for lowest cost. Special attention is given to the imbalance market, as the differences between maximum and minimum price are very large. The use case for the presented analysis is Croatian TSO, but most of the analysis should generalise well to other TSOs.

"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has grown and taken up challenging environmental issues. This technology helps accomplish sustainable development goals by helping us develop more effectively, use resources more sustainably and effciently reduce waste and manage. Sustainable AI must be adapted to cater to the unique circumstances of each culture. The proper protections and procedures must be in place for AI systems, given the need for vast data to train the system. It has extensive applications for anything from ocean monitoring to climate change prediction modeling because of its skills in data processing. AI, Machine Learning (ML) and Robotic Process Automation (RPA) have helped these sectors survive with fewer people and varied limits, all while keeping prices low. Digital transformation is a culture, organization, and operations shift to increase customer value. This paper examines AI's role in developing a sustainable environment. Primary goals and sustainable AI activities that contribute to sustainability are briefly covered. Finally, key applications of AI to sustainability were identified and explored.

"Aggregating distributed energy resources in power systems significantly increases uncertainties, in particular caused by the fluctuation of renewable energy generation. This issue has driven the necessity of widely exploiting advanced predictive control techniques under uncertainty to ensure long-term economics and decarbonization. In this paper, we propose a real-time uncertainty-aware energy dispatch framework, which is composed of two key elements: (i) A hybrid forecast-and-optimize sequential task, integrating deep learning-based forecasting and stochastic optimization, where these two stages are connected by the uncertainty estimation at multiple temporal resolutions; (ii) An efficient online data augmentation scheme, jointly involving model pre-training and online fine-tuning stages. In this way, the proposed framework is capable to rapidly adapt to the real-time data distribution, as well as to target on uncertainties caused by data drift, model discrepancy and environment perturbations in the control process, and finally to realize an optimal and robust dispatch solution. The proposed framework won the championship in CityLearn Challenge 2022, which provided an influential opportunity to investigate the potential of AI application in the energy domain.

"Under the background of “carbon peak” and “carbon neutrality”, China's cities are at the heart of climate change mitigation. To fulfill the commitments, the potential drivers of China's low-carbon economy at the city level should be explored. Thus, this study estimated the quality of low-carbon economy from the perspectives of carbon emissions and sequestration. Subsequently, spatial econometric approach was adopted to analyze the direct and spatial spillover effects of drivers on low-carbon economy. Moreover, to explore more potential variables, this study combined machine learning algorithms with different weight matrices to assess the importance scores of neighbouring cities' potential variables. The results show that (1) GDP per capita, emissions reduction technological progress, terrestrial vegetation's net primary productivity and the ratio of forest land cover improved cities' low-carbon economy; (2) land urbanization reduced nearby cities' low-carbon economy (especially those with high human footprint index at the inter-city border), which was caused by its negative spatial spillover effects on forest net primary production; (3) based on importance analysis, this study found that the characteristics of different sectors (e.g., the ratio of labor to fixed capital stocks, employment and fixed asset investment expenditure) also significantly influenced nearby cities' low-carbon economy. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",2,10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.138300,This paper investigates the drivers of a low-carbon economy in Chinese cities using spatial econometrics and machine learning to assess the impact of various factors on carbon emissions and sequestration.

"The use of electric vehicles (EVs) in the power system has grown phenomenally, and when combined with smart grids, a wealth of raw data is accessible. It is challenging to plan and schedule for EVs due to the randomness of their driver behavior and their uncertainties. To cope with these uncertainties, a supervised machine-learning framework (Random Forest) is developed using an open-source application (emobpy) that simulates EVs to help EV aggregators and drivers predict annual charger accessibility. Since ML models are complex black boxes to decipher, a game theory method SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), is employed to indicate the impact of each feature on the model outcome.

"Across the world, electric distribution utilities are facing two major challenges i.e., non-technical losses and electricity theft. These losses occur extremely high. Consequently, electric distribution networks’ performance deteriorates drastically. Many traditional methods are in practice to detect and minimize these losses, but these are not so effective and also very time-consuming. Hence, keen researchers are looking forward to recent technology, i.e., Artificial Intelligence, because NTL detection by Artificial Intelligence is superior to the traditional techniques in terms of performance such as accuracy.

"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to introduce a neural network-based market agent, which develops optimal bidding strategies for a power generating company (Genco) in a day-ahead electricity market. Design/methodology/approach: The problem of finding optimal bidding strategy for a Genco is formulated as a two-level optimization problem. At the top level, the Genco aims at maximizing its total daily profit, and at the bottom level, the independent system operator obtains the power dispatch quantity for each market participant with the objective of maximizing the social welfare. The neural network is trained using a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm with the objective of maximizing daily profit for the Genco. Findings: The effectiveness of the proposed approach is established through several case studies on the benchmark IEEE 30-bus test system for the day-ahead market, with an hourly clearing mechanism and dynamically changing demand profile. Both block bidding and linear supply function bidding are considered for the Gencos and the variation of optimal bidding strategy with the change in demand is investigated. The performance is also evaluated in the context of the Brazilian electricity market with real market data and compared with the other methods reported in the literature. Practical implications: Strategic bidding is a peculiar phenomenon observed in an oligopolistic electricity market and has several implications on policy making and mechanism design. In this work, the transmission line constraints and demand side bidding are taken into account for a more realistic simulation.

"Global warming has increased the frequency of natural disasters, making enhancing energy efficiency an inevitable choice to address the worsening global climate risks. Whether industrial robots, as a crucial component of artificial intelligence, can contribute to improving energy efficiency remains a subject of debate. This study employs the SBM and super-efficiency SBM models to assess the energy efficiency of 262 Chinese cities from 2010 to 2020. We investigate the impact and mechanisms of industrial robots at the city level on energy efficiency. The research findings indicate that the application of industrial robots promotes enhanced energy efficiency, which remains robust after subjecting it to a battery of tests, including SYS-GMM and instrumental variable analyses. However, a significant nonlinear relationship exists between industrial robot utilization and energy efficiency, with diminishing marginal effects. Mechanism analysis reveals that the fundamental mechanisms facilitating this improvement are the digital economy, industrial structural adjustments, and innovations in green technology. Heterogeneity analysis suggests that industrial robots have a more pronounced impact on cities with higher energy efficiency, greater manufacturing levels in resource-dependent areas, and lower population densities. Furthermore, the application of industrial robots can influence the energy efficiency of neighboring regions through spatial spillover effects. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",2,10.1016/j.jclepro.2024.142593,"This paper investigates the impact of industrial robots, a component of AI, on energy efficiency in Chinese cities using SBM and super-efficiency SBM models.

"Many firms have established formal carbon neutrality (CN) targets in response to the increasing climate risk and related regulatory requirements. Subsequently, they have implemented various measures and adopted multiple approaches to attain these goals. Academic research has given due attention to firms' efforts in this direction. However, past studies have primarily focused on non-digital and process-oriented approaches to achieving CN, with the potential of digital technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) remaining less explored. Our study aims to address this gap by qualitatively examining the use of AI for pursuing CN, drawing insights from firms with prior experience in the area. We analyzed the collected qualitative data to identify four key dimensions that capture different nuances of applying AI for achieving CN: (a) implementing AI for direct and indirect control of emissions, (b) accepting the strategic trade-offs related to funding, data and systems concerns, and social priorities, (c) overcoming organizational and human-related impediments, and (d) acknowledging the significant impact of AI in terms of gains in business model efficiency and measurable CN target attainment, which ultimately contribute to CN. Based on our findings, we propose a convergence–divergence model encompassing the positive aspects, inhibiting factors, synergies, and offsets necessary for firms to leverage AI to achieve net-zero emissions effectively.

"Carbon lock-in has become a major obstacle to green development in all countries, and carbon unlocking (CUL) is of great significance in accelerating the process of carbon neutrality worldwide. Based on the panel data of 292 prefecture-level cities in China from 2006 to 2020, this paper constructs a PSM-DID model based on machine learning to empirically test the impact of LCCP policy on urban CUL. The regression result shows that the low carbon city pilot (LCCP) policy significantly increases the level of CUL by 1.25 % in the pilot cities, which is still valid after range of robustness tests, and the mechanism analysis shows that green innovation and green habits are important ways for the policy to affect CUL. Based on the generalized random forest (GRF) algorithm, we further find that the policy can increase the CUL level by 0.6 %, and the average treatment effect (ATE) of the sample is concentrated between 0.004 and 0.006, which exhibits obvious heterogeneity.

We respond to this question starting from the contingency theory and adopting a configurational perspective to inductively explore the interaction effects of two key deep technologies (artificial intelligence and Internet of things) and two key shallow technologies (broadband and cloud computing) on a country’s sustainability performance. We employ the fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) on a data set of 79 countries, allowing us to embrace the synergies brought by technological convergences. Our results determine how deep and shallow technologies complement and substitute each other and thereby create multiple technological pathways towards high and low sustainable development at the national level. In this way, this study offers significant implications for research, policy, and practice concerned with the issues lying at the intersection of technology and sustainability. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2,10.1080/09537325.2023.2220828,"This paper investigates the interaction effects of deep (AI, IoT) and shallow technologies (broadband, cloud computing) on national sustainability performance using fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis.

"Artificial Intelligence (AI), as the core driving force of industrial and technological innovation, has brought technological advances that profoundly affect energy conservation and carbon emission reduction in China. This study constructs a dynamic spatial Durbin model to empirically analyze AI's mechanism path using Chinese inter-provincial panel data as a sample. The findings show the following: (1) Spatial and temporal variations exist in AI development levels and energy conservation and carbon emission reduction. (2) AI has a significant negative impact on energy consumption efficiency and a significant negative spatial spillover effect on carbon emission efficiency, and the effects of AI development level on energy conservation and carbon emission reduction are mainly dominated short term. (3) Green technological progress on both the input and output sides has not played a determinant role in the effects of AI on energy conservation and carbon emission reduction. (4) Given the moderating effect of the degree of factor market development, the improvement of green technological advances can play a positive role in the impact of AI on energy and carbon reduction.

"With the implementation of 14th Five-Year Plan in China and the completion of the poverty alleviation task, the economy in China has made great progress. However, the carbon dioxide (CO2) emission has also increased, which will lead to the greenhouse effect for threatening economic development and affecting people's lives. Global warming has become the greatest challenge to contemporary economic and social development, and the transition to low-carbon economy has become a general trend of world economic development. Meanwhile, the traditional neural network method for predicting the economy and CO2 emissions is not accurate and objective because of the unbalanced labeling of training data and the inability to capture the relationship between time series data. Therefore, an economy and CO2 emission prediction model based on temporal attention Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU) (TA-GRU) with loss function Balanced Mean Square Error (BMSE) (BTA-GRU) mechanism is proposed to analyze and optimize the energy structure of 27 provincial-level administrative regions in China. Due to the unbalanced data labels in the different energy structure of different regions, the improved loss function BMSE is used to solve the problem of unbalanced labels from the perspective of statistics. Then, with coal, gasoline, petroleum, coke, fuel oil, diesel, natural gas and crude oil as inputs, the per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as the desired output and the CO2 as the undesired output, the GRU can better capture time step dependencies in time series, and the attention mechanism can assign different weights to each time step, so that the proposed method can better learn data features and improve the accuracy of the an economic and CO2 emission prediction model. Finally, the CO2 emission and economic prediction model of different provincial-level administrative regions in China is established based on this proposed method. The experimental results show that compared with other mainstream time series data prediction models, this proposed model has better stability and practicability, and its mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and root mean square error (RMSE) reach 3.43, 3.28% and 2449.57, respectively. Furthermore, according to the actual situation of efficient provincial administrative regions, the energy structure of inefficient provincial administrative regions can be adjusted and optimized. Such as the energy structure of Hebei Province can be adjusted according to the energy structure of Beijing, it is estimated that the CO2 emissions of Hebei will be reduced by 82,972.43 ×10000 tons (WT) and its per capita GDP will be increased by 115,856 Yuan.

"The growing interest in the financial materiality of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) ratings has prompted recent investigations into their risk pricing impact in the corporate bond market. The specific implications for the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry have not been explored, as prior work has primarily focused on broad-based ESG integration. To fill this gap, our study employed an interpretable machine learning technique using a sample universe of U.S. corporate bonds spanning from 2010 to 2021 to estimate the impact of ESG ratings on corporate bond issuance spreads. The results revealed an average ESG benefit of 10 basis points across all sectors. However, it is important to note that the effects of ESG ratings on bond pricing demonstrate variation across sectors and individual ESG constituent ratings. Significantly, our findings show that social and governance ratings emerge as the primary drivers influencing bond issuance costs, whereas the impact of environmental scores is comparatively less significant. Within AEC-related industries, empirical data on the influence of ESG ratings indicate discounted pricing by the market is particularly channeled through environmental and governance scores. These findings emphasize the value-added impact of enhanced ESG performance on the cost of debt financing, presenting a financially material opportunity for operational and management decision-making. By adopting sustainable strategies to improve ESG performance, organizations in the AEC industry can potentially achieve lower costs of debt when issuing bonds to secure financing for construction projects.

"To figure out equitable and inclusive strategy to mitigate inequality of carbon emissions, we investigate the solution to narrowing carbon inequality from the perspective of developing artificial intelligence by using the generalized method of moments model and employing a panel dataset from 74 countries during 2000–2019. The asymmetric impact of artificial intelligence on carbon inequality is also checked. In addition, we examine the moderating and mediating effects in the nexus between artificial intelligence and carbon inequality. We find that (1) artificial intelligence has a negative causal relationship with carbon inequality, which indicates that developing artificial intelligence is essential for narrowing carbon inequality. (2) With the increase of the quantile of carbon inequality, artificial intelligence exerts a more remarkable inhibiting effect on carbon inequality, which implies that when the level of carbon inequality is more severe, the implementation of artificial intelligence proves to be a more potent tool for narrowing the disparity of emissions. (3) With the help of climate finance, artificial intelligence becomes even more effective in reducing carbon inequality, verifying the synergistic effect of climate finance and artificial intelligence on carbon inequality eradication.

Specifically, the aim is to understand whether this branch of computer science can influence production and consumption patterns to achieve sustainable resource management according to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) outlined in the UN 2030 Agenda. Moreover, the paper aims to highlight the role of Knowledge Management Systems (KMS) in the cultural drift toward the spread of AI for SBMs. Despite the importance of the topic, there is no comprehensive review of the AI and SBM literature in light of SDGs. Based on a database containing 73 publications in English with publication dates from 1990 to 2019, a bibliometric analysis is conducted. The findings show that the innovation challenge involves ethical, social, economic, and legal aspects. Thus, considering that the development potential of AI is linked to the UN 2030 Agenda for SD, especially to SDG#12, our results also outline the framework of the existing literature on AI and SDGs, especially SDG#12, including AI's association with the cultural drift (CD) in the SBMs. The paper highlights the key contributions, which are: i) a comprehensive review of the key underlying relationship between AI and SBMs, offering a holistic view as needed, ii) identifying a research gap regarding KMS through AI, and iii) the implications of AI concerning SDG#12. Academic and managerial implications are also discussed regarding KMS in the SBMs, where the AI can represent the vehicle to meet the SDGs allowing for the identification of the cultural change required by enterprises to achieve sustainable goals. Thus, business companies, academic research practitioners, and state policy should focus on the further development of the use of AI in SBMs. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",2,10.1016/j.jbusres.2020.08.019,"This paper conducts a bibliometric analysis of the literature on AI's role in constructing sustainable business models, focusing on its influence on production and consumption patterns related to sustainable development goals.

"Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly opening up a new frontier in the fields of business, corporate practices, and governmental policy. The intelligence of machines and robotics with deep learning capabilities have created profound disrupting and enabling impacts on business, governments, and society. They are also influencing the larger trends in global sustainability. As the AI revolution transforms our world, it could herald a utopian future where humanity co-exists harmoniously with machines, or portend a dystopian world filled with conflict, poverty and suffering. More immediately, would AI accelerate our progress on the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) or bring us further down the path toward greater economic uncertainty, environmental collapse, and social upheaval? What are some of the implications for business leadership and the education of future business leaders?

"Energy efficiency of public sector is an important issue in the context of smart cities due to the fact that buildings are the largest energy consumers, especially public buildings such as educational, health, government and other public institutions that have a large usage frequency. However, recent developments of machine learning within Big Data environment have not been exploited enough in this domain. This paper aims to answer the question of how to incorporate Big Data platform and machine learning into an intelligent system for managing energy efficiency of public sector as a substantial part of the smart city concept. Deep neural networks, Rpart regression tree and Random forest with variable reduction procedures were used to create prediction models of specific energy consumption of Croatian public sector buildings. The most accurate model was produced by Random forest method, and a comparison of important predictors extracted by all three methods has been conducted. The models could be implemented in the suggested intelligent system named MERIDA which integrates Big Data collection and predictive models of energy consumption for each energy source in public buildings, and enables their synergy into a managing platform for improving energy efficiency of the public sector within Big Data environment. The paper also discusses technological requirements for developing such a platform that could be used by public administration to plan reconstruction measures of public buildings, to reduce energy consumption and cost, as well as to connect such smart public buildings as part of smart cities.

"Automated decision making and predictive analytics through artificial intelligence, in combination with rapid progress in technologies such as sensor technology and robotics are likely to change the way individuals, communities, governments and private actors perceive and respond to climate and ecological change. Methods based on various forms of artificial intelligence are already today being applied in a number of research fields related to climate change and environmental monitoring. Investments into applications of these technologies in agriculture, forestry and the extraction of marine resources also seem to be increasing rapidly. Despite a growing interest in, and deployment of AI-technologies in domains critical for sustainability, few have explored possible systemic risks in depth. This article offers a global overview of the progress of such technologies in sectors with high impact potential for sustainability like farming, forestry and the extraction of marine resources. We also identify possible systemic risks in these domains including a) algorithmic bias and allocative harms; b) unequal access and benefits; c) cascading failures and external disruptions, and d) trade-offs between efficiency and resilience.

"The main reason for the ongoing process of energy transition in the global economy is the need to protect the environment, especially the climate. Increased public awareness about the destruction of the Earth's ecosystem and technological development have resulted in increased importance of renewable energy sources, which are increasingly replacing conventional sources. In addition to the environmental aspect, renewable energy also gives a chance for greater energy independence and the ability to produce energy by countries without conventional energy resources. These factors cause individual countries and their groups to take more and more decisive actions to develop renewable energy. Particularly ambitious plans in this area are presented by the European Union, which is the undisputed leader in introducing pro-environmental legislation. Therefore, the following article presents the results of research on the degree of renewable energy use in selected sectors of the economy and households in the European Union countries between 2000 and 2019. The impact of the use of renewable energy sources based energy on economic indicators and on the consumption of energy from conventional sources was also determined. Due to the different levels of economic development and wealth of countries, the study also refers to the groups of “old” and “new” European Union countries. The study showed the concentration and dynamics of change in the consumption of renewable energy in the studied sector and households for individual countries and their groups. The Kohonen artificial neural networks were used to analyze similarities between the European Union countries in terms of the use of energy from renewable energy sources in the sectors studied. In addition, correlations were established between economic and environmental parameters for the whole economy, industry and agriculture/forestry/fishing sectors and the consumption of energy from renewable energy sources, as well as the impact of this energy consumption on the consumption of conventional energy. The results obtained showed a significant increase in the consumption of energy from renewable energy sources in the European Union countries in the studied period, as well as significant differences in the use of this energy among the studied countries, their groups and sectors. Also, it was found that renewable energy sources based energy consumption has a positive impact on economic growth, the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the reduction of conventional energy consumption in practically all European Union countries. The results obtained indicate that this impact is greater in the “old” than in the “new” European Union countries. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",2,10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.131076,"This paper analyzes the use of renewable energy in the European Union from 2000 to 2019, focusing on its impact on economic indicators and conventional energy consumption.

"In the context of Industry 4.0, corporate social responsibility (CSR) plays an increasingly important role in firm risk management. To mitigate risk and improve operational productivity, artificial intelligence (AI), a key disruptive technology, has been increasingly employed in many industries. In this study, we examine the relationship between CSR and idiosyncratic risk (IR) as moderated by AI innovation and operational efficiency based on data from 1614 firms in China during the period from 2010 to 2017. The empirical results show that CSR can negatively affect IR, while beyond a certain level, it acts in the opposite direction, exhibiting a U-shaped relationship. In particular, operational efficiency shifts the turning point of the U-shaped curve to the right, implying that firms with high operational efficiency can obtain a higher optimal benefit by improving their CSR. Furthermore, AI innovation flattens the U-shaped curve, thereby weakening CSR's positive impact on IR. This result indicates that AI innovation is not always beneficial. As AI innovation can have some substitution effect on CSR, enterprises should focus on either CSR or AI innovation as their main differentiation strategy to maximize the utilization of resources. We further instrument CSR using the social expenditure ratio of the province where the firm is headquartered to address a potential endogeneity concern. Finally, we provide several prominent managerial implications for enterprises, governments, and investors. © 2021 Production and Operations Management Society",2,10.1111/poms.13483,"This paper investigates the relationship between corporate social responsibility (CSR) and idiosyncratic risk, moderated by AI innovation and operational efficiency, using data from Chinese firms.

"Industrial robots are a key enabling technology of Industry 4.0 and the artificial intelligence revolution, which is of great significance in sustainable development. Existing research has focused on the economic effects of industrial robot application, but research on the environmental effects remains insufficient. Based on the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) model and using sample data from 35 countries from 1993 to 2017, this paper empirically examines the carbon emission reduction effects of industrial robot application. Three key findings emerged. First, the application of industrial robots significantly reduces carbon intensity. The application of industrial robots leads to increased productivity, the optimisation of factor structures, and technological innovation in production, which improve energy efficiency and reduce carbon intensity. Second, there is a two-dimensional heterogeneity in the carbon intensity reduction effects of industrial robot application in terms of the application fields and possible countries for application. Compared to other fields, the application of industrial robots in manufacturing, agriculture, and electricity, gas, and water supply fields significantly promotes carbon intensity reduction. Furthermore, industrial robots in developed countries have better emission reduction effects than in developing countries. Third, the application of industrial robots has a dual-channel mediating mechanism for carbon intensity reduction: first, there is a mediating role of green total factor productivity and energy intensity; second, absorptive capacity plays a moderating role. On the one hand, high absorptive capacity brings about a better innovation environment and enhances the effects of carbon emission reduction; on the other hand, the application of industrial robots promotes carbon intensity reduction by positively influencing the improvement of green total factor productivity and energy intensity. Finally, policy recommendations are provided based on the results. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",2,10.1016/j.techsoc.2022.102034,"This paper empirically examines the environmental impact of industrial robot applications on carbon intensity reduction using data from 35 countries.

"Energy poverty has a remarkable impact on socioeconomic development and human health. To identify energy poverty and further explore its influencing factors, this study uses 8239 households from 25 provinces from the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) as the research object. First, the household energy poverty index (EPI) from 2012 to 2016 is measured. Second, the partially linear functional-coefficient (PLFC) model, which can capture individual heterogeneity, is employed to investigate how renewable energy technology innovation (RETI) alleviates energy poverty, also examining the role of marketization in the alleviation effect. The findings are as follows: (1) RETI significantly alleviates household energy poverty; (2) the alleviation effect of RETI on household EPI is affected by the marketization level (ML). In particular, when the ML is greater than 5.94, the alleviation effect is stronger; (3) under the influence of the ML, the alleviation effect exhibits a significant spatial heterogeneity. The eastern provinces exhibit the most significant alleviation effect.

"Radical technological advancements and the relentless progression of climate change compel organisations to ensure their workforce consistently exercise their creativity toward innovative green initiatives. These endeavours are essential to achieve the United Nations' (UN) sustainable development goals (SDGs). To do so, organisations require competencies fundamental to smart technologies, artificial intelligence, robotics and algorithms (STARA). STARA competencies are relevant for leaders to bolster green organisational innovative evidence (GOIE). GOIE can help to attract potential investors keen on advancing the UN's SDG agenda on environmental sustainability. However, eclipsed by a volatile environment, and despite the green innovation potential of several manufacturing organisations, investors are reluctant to invest and commit funds without evidence of green innovation. We therefore, investigate how leader STARA competence (LSC), green creativity components (task motivation, creativity skills and expertise) and environmental dynamism can aid organisations to boost their GOIE. Our key findings are as follows: (a) though green task motivation shows a stronger association with green creativity skills, LSC has a large influence on green creativity skills; (b) green creativity skills exert a strong influence on GOIE while also playing a competitive and complimentary mediating role in our model and (c) environmental dynamism is negatively associated with green creativity skills and GOIE.

"Green Mining Construction (GMC) is the Chinese national strategy of the environmental regulation of the mining industry to motivate mining enterprises to improve their resource utilization efficiency, protect the environment and harmonize the relationship between enterprises and communities. This paper uses system dynamics (SD) and the Malmquist-Luenberger (ML) Index to model the sustainable effect of the policy instruments of Green Mining Construction, namely, environmental taxes and subsidies. A case study of typical coal mining enterprises in Anhui, China, is provided to demonstrate the application of the proposed model in which the corporate performances of three optional strategies in response to the Green Mining Construction policies are examined. The responsive strategies are categorized as scale expansion, technical innovation and environmental protection. The simulation results show the following: (i) The environmental taxes and subsidies with disparate rates can help enterprises that focus on technical innovation and environmental protection perform better, albeit with a certain degree of lag. (ii) The synergy impact of subsidies and taxes is not significantly more than the separate ones. (iii) Environmental regulations reduce the productivity of mining enterprises, but to varying extents. This negative effect of environmental regulation should be compensated by other measures.

"As sustainable urban communities continue to seek alternative energy sources, this study explores the inclusion of renewable resources in the energy mix. With a focus on liquefied natural gas (LNG) regasification, parabolic trough solar collectors, dual-loop power cycles, proton exchange membrane electrolysis, and hydrogen liquefaction cycle, this research conducts a comprehensive examination of an integrated system. The primary objective is to provide a diverse range of valuable outputs, including electricity, liquefied hydrogen, desalinated water, and cooling for coastal areas. Through careful analysis of regional geographic features, San Francisco emerges as a suitable location due to its favorable solar radiation intensity and existing LNG transportation infrastructure. The findings reveal that the integrated system has the potential to deliver approximately 5750.4 MWh of cooling, 14988.85 MWh of electricity, and 1,491,084 m3 of fresh water, thereby significantly contributing to the city's utility demands. In terms of data-driven optimization, artificial neural networks serve as intermediary mechanisms to establish correlations between the developed code and the optimization algorithm. The results demonstrate that the optimized system exhibits notable improvements in production capacity. Moreover, significant reductions in the levelized cost of electricity (0.19 Cent/kWh), fresh water (1.22 Cent/m3), and hydrogen (0.08 $/kg) are observed.

"Artificial intelligence (AI) is often seen as a key technology for future economic growth. However, the concrete socio-economic effects have not yet been clearly researched. This is especially true for sustainability issues, which have so far been neglected in the discussion about the impact of AI despite its immense importance. Consequently, this paper focuses on the impact of AI on the regional energy system, which is considered to play a crucial role in addressing the societal challenge of climate change. Apart from the direct influence of AI on the regional energy consumption in Germany, regional differences are also investigated. For the corresponding empirical analysis, various datasets are combined and analysed in a panel-regression at the regional NUTS-3 level (Nomenclature des unités territoriales statistiques).

"With the deep integration of artificial intelligence and the real economy, the development of industrial intelligence brings important opportunities for green economic growth. However, few studies have provided insight into whether and how industrial intelligence affects carbon intensity. To bridge this gap, this study explores the impact of industrial intelligence on carbon intensity and how this impact fluctuates when industrial structure upgrading is included as a mediator, based on the spatial Durbin model (SDM) and the mediating effect model. The empirical results show that both industrial intelligence and carbon intensity have a significant spatial correlation. The development of industrial intelligence effectively reduces the carbon intensity of the local and neighboring regions with influence coefficients of −0.1031 and −0.1720, respectively. Considering the regional heterogeneity, the inhibitory effect of industrial intelligence on carbon intensity in the eastern region is strongest, followed by the central region, and negligible in western China. Industrial structure upgrading is an important mediating channel for industrial intelligence to function. Specifically, industrial intelligence can indirectly curb carbon intensity through promoting industrial structure supererogation and industrial structure rationalization, and the indirect effects account for 69.08% and 17.58% of the total effects, respectively.

"Smart grids (SG) are electricity grids that communicate with each other, provide reliable information, and enable administrators to operate energy supplies across the country, ensuring optimized reliability and efficiency. The smart grid contains sensors that measure and transmit data to adjust the flow of electricity automatically based on supply/demand, and thus, responding to problems becomes quicker and easier. This also plays a crucial role in controlling carbon emissions, by avoiding energy losses during peak load hours and ensuring optimal energy management. The scope of big data analytics in smart grids is huge, as they collect information from raw data and derive intelligent information from the same. However, these benefits of the smart grid are dependent on the active and voluntary participation of the consumers in real-time. Consumers need to be motivated and conscious to avail themselves of the achievable benefits. Incentivizing the appropriate actor is an absolute necessity to encourage prosumers to generate renewable energy sources (RES) and motivate industries to establish plants that support sustainable and green-energy-based processes or products.

"A more comprehensive understanding of the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on energy transition and carbon emissions could help to use AI to achieve carbon neutrality. To this end, the STIRPAT approach, the mediation effect technique and the panel threshold technique are developed using the panel data in 69 countries from 1993 to 2019. The results show that: (i) AI promote energy transition and carbon emission reduction, and trade openness (indicated by imports, exports and total trade volume) has the mediating effect. (ii) There is a single-threshold of trade openness in the impact of AI on carbon emissions. When trade openness is below the threshold, AI has an insignificant impact on carbon emissions; when trade openness crosses the threshold, AI has a significant negative impact on carbon emissions. There is a double-threshold of trade openness in the impact of AI on energy transition. When trade openness is lower than the first threshold, the impact of AI on energy transition is not significant; When trade openness is higher than the second threshold, the positive impact of AI on energy transition is increased. (iii) When considering the heterogeneity of income levels and AI levels, the trade threshold for achieving carbon emission reductions in the high-income group is lower than that of the global group, and the trade threshold for achieving carbon emission reductions in the low-AI level group is higher than that of the global group. While this study unequivocally delineates the affirmative role of artificial intelligence in carbon emission reduction and energy transformation, particularly in the context of trade openness, we concurrently acknowledge that this viewpoint is not devoid of contention. Amidst the rapid advancement of technology and the landscape of open trade, we discern the presence of counterarguments.

"The implications of technological innovation for sustainability are becoming increasingly complex with information technology moving machines from being mere tools for production or objects of consumption to playing a role in economic decision making. This emerging role will acquire overwhelming importance if, as a growing body of literature suggests, artificial intelligence is underway to outperform human intelligence in most of its dimensions, thus becoming superintelligence. Hitherto, the risks posed by this technology have been framed as a technical rather than a political challenge. With the help of a thought experiment, this paper explores the environmental and social implications of superintelligence emerging in an economy shaped by neoliberal policies. It is argued that such policies exacerbate the risk of extremely adverse impacts. The experiment also serves to highlight some serious flaws in the pursuit of economic efficiency and growth per se, and suggests that the challenge of superintelligence cannot be separated from the other major environmental and social challenges, demanding a fundamental transformation along the lines of degrowth. Crucially, with machines outperforming them in their functions, there is little reason to expect economic elites to be exempt from the threats that superintelligence would pose in a neoliberal context, which opens a door to overcoming vested interests that stand in the way of social change toward sustainability and equity. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",2,10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.12.138,"This paper uses a thought experiment to explore the environmental and social implications of superintelligence within a neoliberal economic framework, arguing that such policies may exacerbate risks associated with AI.

Afterwards, FPBARDL based long, short and strong causality analyses are conducted. The empirical findings revealed positive impacts of all I4.0-related variables on emissions in the long-run. Though I4.0 related AI and ICT innovation has no direct effect in the short-run, its effects are determined through increased energy consumption towards emissions. The strong positive effects of energy consumption and positive effects of economic growth, ICT exports and R&D are observed both in the short and long-run. In addition to positive impacts of I4.0 on environment, the findings favor insufficiency of policies focusing on lowering emissions in I4.0 context.Policy recommendations include strong commitment to energy efficiency and renewable energies and trade policies with environmental concerns. © 2022",2,10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.135786,"This paper investigates the relationship between Industry 4.0 and environmental sustainability, specifically analyzing the long-run and short-run effects of Industry 4.0 variables on CO2 emissions using a panel of countries.

"Recent globalization and industrialization efforts have pushed many companies to seriously consider innovation efficiency and its effectiveness. Industries seek to integrate innovation thinking in the company, resulting in different innovation theories. However, these theories become mostly ineffective when disruptions such as pandemics, political instability, or other natural events occur. In response to such disruptions, frugal innovation has been adopted in recent years because it can maximize efficiency with fewer resources. While frugal thinking is effective from an economic perspective, not enough attention has been devoted to exploring this innovative thinking method from the perspective of other pillars of sustainability (environment and society). This article focuses on this gap to deepen the understanding of sustainable frugal innovation in a recent business environment under various theoretical perspectives (triple bottom line, diffusion of innovation, and critical success factor theories). Technology is a vehicle for innovation, so this article integrates the technological advantages of AI with sustainable frugal innovation as a driving force for its effective implementation; other existing studies are limited. Integrating AI with sustainable frugal innovation requires precise actions that can be the result of understanding AIs critical success factors from the perspectives of sustainable frugal thinking. Therefore, this article analyzes the critical success factors for AI through grey DEMATEL. A research framework has been proposed and validated with a Danish case study context. Among 24 overall common critical success factors, 'understanding the concept of AI' and 'level of AI investment' in sustainable frugal innovation are identified as the most influential success factors. In addition, influential connections among other overall common success factors are presented. These findings could motivate industries to explore different options for successfully integrating AI with their sustainable frugal thinking, which may increase their business competitiveness during disruptions in a more sustainable way.  © 1988-2012 IEEE.",2,10.1109/TEM.2021.3116187,"This paper explores the integration of AI with sustainable frugal innovation, focusing on critical success factors that facilitate this integration in the context of disruptions.

"Existing electrical generating stations must operate with greater flexibility due to increasing renewable energy penetration on the electrical grid, and many coal-fired power stations have transitioned away from baseload operation to load-following operation to aid in grid stability. In cases where multiple independently controlled cooling tower cells are used in parallel for the cooling purposes of such stations, there is an opportunity to increase plant efficiency through data-driven optimization across their full load ranges. This work presents a novel application of real-time optimization using machine learning and particle swarm optimization on a multi-cell induced-draft cooling tower servicing a coal-fired power station under variable load. This is the first work to demonstrate simultaneous optimization of a multi-cell cooling tower, in addition to using machine learning for closed-loop control on a cooling tower. A novel control configuration is presented that ensures original control logic is not adversely affected and that the overall plant process is not disrupted using only existing hardware and operational data. To verify this methodology, the 12 independent cooling tower cells are simulated in parallel using historic operating data to demonstrate the effectiveness of real-time optimization compared to current practice. An artificial neural network is trained to predict overall cooling tower power consumption using only operational data and ambient conditions with an R2 value of greater than 0.96. The real-time optimization using particle swarm yields 6.7% annual energy usage savings compared to current practices, although the extent of the real-time savings varies greatly with both plant load and environmental conditions. This is particularly significant for a variable load situation because frequent ramping typically results in reduced overall efficiency. This proposed AI-based solution presents an opportunity to improve the overall heat rate of a load-following coal-fired power plant without the need to perform extensive first-principles modeling or add additional hardware to the cooling tower, resulting in more resources conserved and less overall emissions per unit of electricity generated. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",2,10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.122175,This paper presents a novel application of machine learning and particle swarm optimization to enhance the efficiency of cooling towers in coal-fired power stations under variable load conditions.

"To examine the impact of the application of artificial intelligence on the green technology innovation performance of enterprises, a multi-period difference-in-differences model was constructed. Panel data of Chinese listed manufacturing companies over the period of 2014–2020 were used. According to Stimulus-Organism-Response theory, the impact of artificial intelligence on the green technology innovation performance of enterprises is not direct. The mediating effects of basic knowledge coupling, complementary knowledge coupling, and extended knowledge coupling are verified through empirical tests. The results show that artificial intelligence significantly positively impacts the innovation performance of enterprises in relation to the development of green technology and its decomposition variables (efficiency and progress of green technology).

"Energy efficiency based on behavioral change has attracted increasing interest in recent years, although, solutions in this area lack much needed techno-economic analysis. That is due to the absence of both prospective studies and consumer awareness. To close such gap, this paper proposes the first techno-economic assessment of a behavioral change-based building energy efficiency solution, to the best of the authors’ knowledge. From the one hand, the technical assessment is conducted through (i) introducing a novel edge-based energy efficiency solution; (ii) analyzing energy data using machine learning tools and micro-moments, and producing intelligent, personalized, and explainable action recommendations; and (iii) proceeding with a technical evaluation of four application scenarios, i.e., data collection, data analysis and anomaly detection, recommendation generation, and data visualization. On the other hand, economic assessment is performed by examining the marketability potential of the proposed solution via a market and research analysis of behavioral change-based systems for energy efficiency applications. Also, various factors impacting the commercialization of the final product are investigated before providing recommended actions to ensure its potential marketability via conducting a Go/No-Go evaluation. In conclusion, the proposed solution is designed at a low cost and can save up to 28%–68% of the consumed energy, which results in a Go decision to commercialize the technology. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2,10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.129786,"This paper presents a techno-economic assessment of a behavioral change-based energy efficiency solution, utilizing machine learning for data analysis and personalized recommendations.

"Due to the widespread deployment of distributed energy resources, renewable energies and battery energy storage, the peer to peer (P2P) energy trading schematic has gained the staple attention for improving the energy efficiency and energy flexibility of power grids. This is while, smart demand response programming (DRP) is considered as the bridge between these two indicators of smart grid. Moreover, the subtle point of proliferating P2P schematics is the regulation towards the maximization of social welfare leading to economic profitability of customers and owner's of microgrid and, eventually, reduction of pollutant emission of fossil fuels. Also, uncertainty, aroused by electrical consumption and renewable energy resources, is the core of every considerations, which has to be dealt with intelligent algorithms for strengthening the stability of transactions. On the other hand, compatibility with upper grid's regulations, i.e. power loss and voltage deviation, along with determining fair price of energy trading are the subjects of P2P-based tactics. Therefore, this paper proposes a P2P-based transactive energy sharing architecture, as two stage mixed integer non-linear programming, using smart DRP integrated with machine learning approach, i.e. radial basis neural network. Firstly, the uncertainty of electrical demand and renewable energies are relaxed through short term forecasting. Doing so, the day-ahead transactions of peers are obtained based on their energy management objective, targeting the energy reliability of customers, which energy not supplied criterion has to be equal to zero. Then, participation of customers in DRP, cost of customers, revenue of microgrid's owner and transactions of real time programming are optimally acquired based on Pareto front technique. Also, the simulations are conducted on IEEE 85 bus test system to realize the considerations. The results convey that the profitability of customers and owners is tied with the implementation of smart DRP and accurate forecasting of uncertain variables. In addition, the maximum improvements towards maximizing the revenue of owners and minimizing the cost of customers take place at hours which the electrical consumption is shifted from peaks to off-peaks and mid-peaks, certifying the performance of proposed methodology. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",2,10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.132403,This paper proposes a peer-to-peer energy trading architecture that integrates smart demand response programming with machine learning techniques to optimize energy transactions and improve profitability for customers and microgrid owners.

"Supporting good waste management practices is crucial for the sustainable development of cities. Transforming the practices of cities is a complex problem that requires understanding their societal, technological, and economic processes. Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence techniques that generates models from patterns in data. Many of these models are difficult to present to city planners because of poor transparency. To provide insights for policymaking, interpretable machine learning models between city attributes and waste management performance are needed. Country attributes have a top-down influence on the sustainability of cities. Their inclusion provides deeper insights in addition to city-wide scope analysis. This work develops a rule-based machine learning model in the impact of city and country attributes on waste management. Rough set-based machine learning is used to generate models consisting of if-then rules with data from 100 cities in 41 countries.

"Institutional investors seek to make environmentally sustainable investments using environment, social, governance (ESG) ratings. Current ESG ratings have limited validity because they are based on idiosyncratic scores derived using subjective, discretionary methodologies. We discuss a new direction for developing corporate environmental performance (CEP) ratings and propose a solution to the limited validity problem by anchoring such ratings in environmental controversies. The study uses a novel machine learning approach to make the ratings more comprehensive and transparent, based on a set of algorithmic approaches that handle nonlinearity when aggregating ESG indicators. This approach minimizes the rater subjectivity and preferences inherent in traditional ESG indicators. The findings indicate that controversies as proxies for non-compliance with environmental responsibilities can be predicted well.

"With a mean annual growth rate of roughly 50%, the solar industry has experienced unprecedented growth in the last decade, largely owing to the steadily falling prices of solar installations. Utility-scale energy prices from solar installations are now comparable to all other forms of generation, and the cost of residential system installation has dropped on average by 70%, before incentives. However, the factors explaining this trend extend beyond falling prices. This paper presents a data-centric framework, grounded in machine-learning theory, to estimate solar installations as a function of social, economic, and demographic factors. By doing so, the authors seek to identify the key influencing factors of a community's adoption of renewable energy. To illustrate the applicability of the proposed data-centric framework, the state of California was selected as a case study. Results indicate that differences in population-adjusted adoption rates can be largely explained by variations in key factors such as income, race, political leaning, average electric power consumption, and solar radiation. By analyzing these differences, decision makers can devise effective incentive mechanisms to nudge homeowners toward improved access to renewable technology. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.",2,10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000767,"This paper develops a data-centric framework using machine learning to analyze the factors influencing solar energy adoption in California, focusing on social, economic, and demographic variables.

"Carbon emissions have been identified as a major cause of global warming and are harmful to the environment. Given the seriousness of climate changes, businesses are encouraged to adopt corporate strategies to improve environmental performance. Staggered boards (or classified boards) are one of the controversial corporate governance devices being employed by corporations that protect managers from the market for corporate control. This paper explores whether staggered boards can be a useful business strategy to improve carbon emissions. Relying on a novel data set in which the presence of a staggered board is identified through advanced machine learning algorithms and textual analysis, we find that staggered boards bring about significantly worse emission performance by 10.67%. Our results corroborate the premise that staggered boards insulate self-interested managers from market discipline and thus exacerbate agency problems, resulting in more unfavorable outcomes. Further analysis validates the results, that is, propensity score matching, entropy balancing, instrumental-variable analysis, and generalized method of moments (GMM) dynamic panel data estimation. Importantly, we include firm fixed effects to account for unobserved heterogeneity. Our findings indicate that de-staggered boards may help improve emission performance. © 2022 The Authors.

"Recently, several countries have focused on industrial decarbonization to ensure that the net emissions of carbon dioxide reach zero and contribute to decreasing the global mean temperature. This study aims to investigate the feasibility of a net-zero carbon roadmap for the petrochemical industry by 1) developing an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)-based generative model to produce stochastic scenarios for offshore wind power in an electrical grid, and 2) conducting techno-economic and environmental assessments for forecasting models that define offshore wind power networks. Firstly, data processing techniques were utilized on remotely sensed offshore wind speed datasets and energy data obtained from petrochemical industrial parks. Second, a generative model was designed using a variational autoencoder (VAE) to produce different forecast scenarios of offshore wind power. Third, stochastic scenarios were developed by considering behavioral characteristics of offshore wind power with stochastic scenario uncertainties. Finally, we investigated the techno-economic and environmental assessments of the proposed renewable energy networks. Comparing to the case of offshore wind power in 2022, The proposed XAI-driven net-zero carbon roadmap indicated that the total cost of electricity generation and fossil fuel cost with carbon capture and storage (CCS) can be reduced by 4% and 42% with 41% reduction of CO2 emission.

"With the ever-increasing environmental degradation, poor corporate governance, and social disharmony, adopting sustainable practices is imperative to ensure a prolonged and healthy quality of life. Environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing is a form of socially responsible investing promoting sustainability. ESG ratings quantitatively measure the sustainable practices of companies, with lower ratings meaning more sustainable practices adopted.

"With growing climate change concerns, and constant advancements in smart technology, artificial intelligence, robotics, and algorithms (STARA), organisations in emerging economies are becoming more compelled to go green, develop and deploy their STARA capability to boost profits more effectively, and their environmental sustainability (ES). Likewise, with governments increasingly calling for ES, organisations' human resource management (HRM) is further pressured to ensure their programmes aid realisation of environmental objectives without compromising profit maximisation. However, it remains unclear how complementary Green HRM (GHRM) programmes can be supported by organisational STARA capability (OSC) to bolster ES. Accordingly, we investigate how OSC and GHRM programmes predict ES through a time lagged survey design with data from 461 managers of 177 manufacturing organisations in Nigeria. Results indicate that OSC positively predicts all GHRM programmes and ES but dampens the positive relationship between green training, involvement and development (GTID), and ES.

"The scope of this study is to investigate the main determinants of renewable energy investments in Greece. For this reason, we build an appropriate framework to infer the decision-making process in the renewable energy sources (RES).

We argue that these investors are willing to invest a higher amount in the RES industry today.

"This study develops an investment decision making platform for carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technology using an artificial intelligent (AI) algorithm featuring an optimization via a mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) formulation. This computational strategy offers a smart rapid investment decision evaluation of CCS technology through several economic-environmental-technical-policy (EETP) uncertainties. This is applied to a coal-fired power plant (PP) in Shenzhen, China. Historical (2019) and forecast (2030) operations are evaluated under dynamic and static carbon price regimes. Scenario 1 under dynamic carbon pricing exhibits a positive (sustainable) investment decision for CCS deployment at 28% net revenue gain of selling electricity. Scenarios 2–4 feature negative (unsustainable) investments for CCS technology at 44%, 7% and 66% net revenue loss, respectively. Carbon price is identified to be the dominant variable/uncertainty in recognizing the sustainability outcome of CCS investment followed by the combined market trends of coal and electricity prices. This current work demonstrates a computation approach for dealing with all the uncertainties at hand and is therefore necessary and critical for rational future investment decisions and operations in clean power production (as demonstrated in this PP + CCS context), suggesting the EETP objectives cannot be met without intelligent algorithmic operations. The present analysis exemplifies the trade-offs mainly between the cost of CO2 emission and the cost of PP operation with CCS. It can be used as an indicator on the energy transformation readiness based on current and forecast global conditions.

"With the rapid growth of mobile internet, Internet of Things (IoT), and cloud computing, the demand for data services has arisen sharply. As the core data service infrastructure, the number of data centers (DCs) has surged and led to higher energy consumption, which is not conducive to energy conservation, emission reduction, and sustainable development. In this paper, we proposed an energy-saving solution based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and digital twin in DC scenarios, called Smart DC. The proposed solution can reduce DCs' energy consumption by optimizing air distribution and reducing cooling redundancy. Specifically, the digital twin model in this solution is used to verify and optimize AI strategies, and solve the problem of insufficient data in physical data center. Data for AI training and information mining is limited because the environment in the DCs change little. Moreover, in order to ensure that the DCs operate at a safe temperature, the adjustment of parameters should be conservative, so there is still room for cooling redundancy. We combined digital twin and AI, exploring the temperature rise boundary in the digital DCs and mine more data pairs, which has proven to increase the robustness of the AI model and achieve better energy-saving effect.

"Purpose: This paper aims to examine how the use of environmental, social and governance (ESG) incentives intersects with top management power and various corporate governance mechanisms to affect excess annual cash bonus compensation. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use a novel artificial intelligence (AI) technique to obtain data about ESG incentives use by firms in the S&P 500. The authors test the hypotheses with an endogenous treatment-regression and a contrast test. Findings: When the top management team has power and uses ESG incentives, there is a 32% reduction in excess annual cash bonuses implying ESG incentives are an effective corporate governance tool. However, nuanced analyses reveal that when powerful management teams with ESG incentives are from environmentally sensitive industries, have a corporate social responsibility (CSR) committee or have long-term view institutional shareholders, they derive excess bonuses. Practical implications: Stakeholders will better understand management’s motivations for the inclusion of ESG incentives in executive compensation contracts and be able to identify situations which require closer scrutiny. Social implications: Given the increased popularity of ESG incentives, society, regulators, boards of directors and management teams will be interested in better understanding when these incentives might be effective and when they might be abused.

"Artificial intelligence (AI) in sustainable businesses has attracted interest in various industries. However, research on the sustainable adoption of AI is scarce. The present research contributes to this gap by investigating the benefits of AI for sustainable businesses. Qualitative content analysis was used to investigate twenty-five of the largest Finnish enterprises. In the years 2017–2021, AI was employed in twenty of these enterprises, sixteen of which relied on AI to obtain benefits associated with sustainable business practices. Based on the sample, AI can be perceived as a generalizing technology in Finland. Additionally, the strategic significance of AI for enterprises has been discovered to be increasing.

"The literature on servitization and product-service systems calls for more robust evidence and theory regarding the concept of “sustainable servitization”, and how it balances sustainability, profits, and servitization. This study interprets sustainable servitization as an interaction of sustainability and servitization, investigating how servitization moderates the complex relationship between strategic emphasis on sustainability and company profitability. Using Computer-aided Text Analysis (CATA) augmented by machine learning, this study analyzes the annual reports of U.S. manufacturing companies from 1993 to 2019. The study uses objective profitability measures and longitudinal panel data. As the first contribution, the results show a negative direct relationship between manufacturing firms’ sustainability emphasis and firm profitability.

"New technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) play important roles in transportation emissions trading platforms. Due to the complexity and stochastically changing prices of emissions, an effective algorithm is needed in these platforms to optimize the use of emissions. By setting an upper bound for buying and a lower bound for selling, such an algorithm can reduce trading risk and ensure the stability of trading platforms. In this study, we developed an automatic emissions permit trading system using a dynamic programming approach with selling and purchasing bounds for transportation firms with non-negligible fixed transaction setup costs. We partially characterize the optimal transportation and permit trading policies by exploiting a new mathematical property that is suitable for a two-dimensional control system. We attempt to elucidate the optimal coordination of permit trading and permit consumption for a transportation firm facing both the Markov price process and random demand during a multi-period planning horizon. We prescribe an optimal trading policy and propose a well-performed heuristic policy and a tight lower bound for the platform. We also show that the easily implemented heuristic policy would not significantly increase emissions.

"Electricity consumption is increasing day by day in every corner of the world which leads to imbalance of supply and demand. In the current scenario, everybody searches for cheaper and environmentally friendly approaches in accessing electricity. In order to mitigate falling into a huge energy crisis, both the utility and consumer could involve in energy management which is a convenient and trending approach. We believe it should be started from the ground level, which is the consumer scope. This paper proposes a method for a smart Residential Energy Management System (REMS) using Machine Learning. Specifically, the proposed system (REMS) effectively switches pre-prioritized possible loads without limiting consumption, between the grid and renewably energized local storage with rooftop solar at the residential premises, using Machine Learning algorithms. Reduction of the electricity bill with a reliable power supply as much as possible in residential premises is also concerned, with the use of by load shifting algorithm.

"As residential photovoltaic (RPV) system gradually replaces fossil energy, it is imperative to conduct the RPV adoption decision analysis to investigate factors that drive RPV growth. Non-linear relationships are common in analyzing adoption behaviors, but they are often ignored in the existing studies due to the limitations of conventional data analysis approaches. On the other hand, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are robust in dealing with non-linear relationships, but they lack interpretation capability, making ANNs unsuitable for RPV adoption analysis. To resolve the interpretation issue when considering non-linear relationships, this study proposes a six-step analytical procedure based on hybrid ANNs. The behavior theory was first integrated into the ANN to improve the model's performance. Afterward, the network weight-based method is implemented to calculate the importance of factors from the trained ANN. The proposed approach was used to analyze RPV adoption in Singapore, and the results indicated that the hybrid-ANN outperforms existing models in predicting and explaining adoption behaviors. The study demonstrates the suitability of adopting ANNs in decision analysis by developing a novel way to construct the hybrid ANN in considering non-linear relationships. In addition, the case study has identified that unfamiliarity with RPV hinders the adoption, emphasized the role of social support in promoting RPV, and proposed three practical policy implications for RPV development in Singapore, which can be extended to residential buildings across the globe. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",2,10.1016/j.techsoc.2022.102062,"This paper proposes a hybrid artificial neural network (ANN) approach to analyze the factors influencing the adoption of residential photovoltaic systems, addressing the limitations of conventional data analysis methods.

"Sustainable growth is the key global priority, and environmental, social and governance (ESG) objectives have become the main point of attention in companies’ digital transformation strategies. ESG and digital transformation reinforce each other as they aim to improve efficiency and meet stakeholders inside and outside the company. This is true for telecommunication companies, where disruptive technologies such as artificial intelligence, big data or cloud computing are reshaping the industry. Assessment of the impact of sustainability disclosures on companies’ value is a task of high interest for academics and practitioners from telecommunication companies. ESG disclosure serves as a key channel to inform investors about the efficiency of ESG risk management and control practices of the firm and thus can impact the firm’s financial performance and market value. However, there are numerous controversies in the academic literature on this topic and a lack of research specifically for the telecommunication industry. We closed the research gaps and investigated the impact of ESG disclosure on Tobin-Q of 93 US-listed telecommunication service companies between 2011-2021. We found that aggregated ESG disclosure score positively impacted telecoms’ Tobin-Q. Among individual ESG disclosure pillars, only corporate governance positively influenced Tobin-Q, while the impact of environmental and social pillars was statistically insignificant. We also found that CEO duality significantly and negatively impacted Tobin-Q. The presence of the corporate social responsibility (CSR) committee, greater gender diversity and a higher percentage of independent directors on the board positively affected the value of the telecoms. The result of the study can be applied in developing ESG rating methodologies for telecommunication companies. They can also assist telecom companies’ managers and stakeholders to identify key value drivers of the ESG agenda. © 2022,International Journal of Technology.All Rights Reserved.",2,10.14716/ijtech.v13i7.6194,"This paper investigates the impact of ESG disclosures on the market value (Tobin-Q) of US-listed telecommunication companies, utilizing firm-level data from 2011 to 2021.

"Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is found to impact firms' performance, for instance, enhancing reputation, increasing innovation capabilities, customer loyalty, and customer satisfaction help improve financial performance. However, the literature provides limited evidence of the relationship between CSR indicators, such as the ESG score, and the firm's profitability, which is often measured by the earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT). We investigate this issue by analyzing a sample of about 400 companies constituting the EuroStoxx-600 index, from 2011 to 2020, using different machine learning models. The novelty of our contribution lies in assessing whether the ESG score has a significant influence on the firms' profitability. Specifically, we investigate the relationship between ESG score and EBIT using machine learning interpretability toolboxes such as partial dependence plots and individual conditional expectation. Tools which help to measure the functional relationship between the predicted response and one or more features, while the Shapley value allows to examine the contribution of the feature to the prediction.

"Innovative control method is prosed for the RED WoLF hybrid storage system. The technology is aimed for residential dwellings and allows to reduce the load from the electrical grid during time with high CO2 emissions. The RED WoLF system consists of a battery, water cylinder, PV array and storage heaters. This technology allows the grid energy to be stored at the “greenest” time, in order to accommodate needs of dwellings with the aid of AI. The original RED WoLF algorithm is considerably improved, following modified progressive threshold approach up to additional 14% savings of CO2 could be obtained. Intriguingly, savings are only slightly lower than global possible mathematical minimum, for the system barred of predictions errors. However, the computation time of the proposed control method is lower by a few orders of magnitudes, with comparison to standard optimisation techniques. Furthermore, the investigation on 11 months period was performed in order find out if there is significant difference between following a time of use tariff or an environmental signal.

"Aggregated demand response for smart grid services is a growing field of interest especially for market participation. A growing trend in research is to utilize aggregated demand response for multiple smart grid services. This could be multi-market trading (day ahead, intraday and imbalance) or a combination of market and ancillary services such offering reserve power or congestion management. However, there is a potential conflict of interest when offering the same resource for simultaneous services. This work investigates the impact, both from a monetary and network stability perspective, of applying a predictive control trading strategy which actively offers aggregated flexibility of electric vehicles on both the German EPEX day ahead and intraday markets. An artificial neural network was used to forecast the available ramp up and down capacity of a Virtual Power Plant (VPP) of 1000 electric vehicles. Using this information, the available flexibility is traded to ramp up in one quarter and down in the next depending on the price delta seen in the intraday market. A number of simulation runs are done, each with different levels of flexibility traded. In every run, one week of realistic VPP behaviour is simulated. The total earnings on the intraday market are calculated as well as imbalance cost and imbalance power generated over this period. It was seen that with an increased offer of available flexibility, there was an increase in both total revenues up to ∼4200 euros for one week of trade as well as imbalance generated, ∼1.6 MWh.

"The negative demand shock due to the COVID-19 lockdown has reduced net demand for electricity-system demand less amount of energy produced by intermittent renewables, hydroelectric units, and net imports-that must be served by controllable generation units. Under normal demand conditions, introducing additional renewable generation capacity reduces net demand. Consequently, the lockdown can provide insights about electricity market performance with a large share of renewables. We find that although the lockdown reduced average day-ahead prices in Italy by 45%, re-dispatch costs increased by 73%, both relative to the average of the same magnitude for the same period in previous years. We estimate a deep-learning model using data from 2017 to 2019 and find that predicted re-dispatch costs during the lockdown period are only 26% higher than the same period in previous years. We argue that the difference between actual and predicted lockdown period re-dispatch costs is the result of increased opportunities for suppliers with controllable units to exercise market power in the re-dispatch market in these persistently low net demand conditions. Our results imply that without grid investments and other technologies to manage low net demand conditions, an increased share of intermittent renewables is likely to increase the costs of maintaining a reliable grid.

Second, it collects a unique and comprehensive dataset of national-level policies addressing the different topics covered by the European Green Deal. Third, in a regression analysis at country level, it examines the interplay between the national regulatory framework and the birth and growth of the cleantech landscape, by distinguishing between innovators (firms which develop the cleantech) and ecosystem firms (which adopt the cleantech). Our results indicate that the introduction of policies favours by itself the birth of cleantech innovator firms and their growth in the country. An increasing number of policies has a regulatory effect in the cleantech ecosystem limiting the number of newborn firms while favouring the growth of existing ones.",2,10.1016/j.enpol.2024.114006,"This paper investigates the role of machine learning in identifying cleantech firms and analyzes the impact of national policies on the growth of these firms within the European context.

"Energy poverty is receiving increased attention in developed countries like the Netherlands. Although it only affects a relatively small share of the population, it constitutes a stern challenge that is hard to quantify and monitor, hence difficult to effectively tackle through adequate policy measures. In this paper we introduce a framework to categorize energy poverty risk based on income and energy expenditure. We propose the use of a machine learning classifier to predict energy poverty risk from a broad set of socio-economic parameters: house value, ownership and age, household size, and average population density. While income remains the single most important predictor, we find that the inclusion of these additional socio-economic features is indispensable in order to achieve high prediction reliability. This result forms an indication of the complex nature of the mechanisms underlying energy poverty. Our findings are valid at different geographical scales, i.e. both for single households and for entire neighborhoods. Extensive sensitivity analysis shows that our results are independent of the precise position of risk category boundaries. The outcomes of our study indicate that machine learning could be used as an effective means to monitor energy poverty, and assist the design and implementation of appropriate policy measures.",2,10.1016/j.enpol.2021.112373,This paper introduces a framework for categorizing energy poverty risk and employs a machine learning classifier to predict this risk using various socio-economic parameters.

"Using a unique panel dataset consisting of 2997 Chinese manufacturing firms publicly listed in the A-share market between 2003 and 2020, we examine whether and to what extent a firm's perception of uncertainty affects green innovation. After integrating textual analysis with a machine learning approach to measure perception of uncertainty, we find that a firm's perception of environmental uncertainty negatively affects the number of green patents submitted or approved. The negative effect is weaker for firms followed by more professional analysts, operating in more competitive markets, or located in regions with better institutional settings. In addition, there is significant heterogeneity in the negative effect between non-state-owned versus state-owned firms as well as polluting versus non-polluting firms. The results are robust to different measures of green innovation and perception of uncertainty, and after addressing for potential endogeneity problem. Our study contributes to the literature on behavioral environmental economics by demonstrating that it is not only the environment uncertainty but also how firms perceive the uncertainty matters for green innovation and corporate social responsibility.",2,10.1142/S0217590823460025,"This paper investigates how a firm's perception of environmental uncertainty influences green innovation, utilizing a panel dataset and integrating textual analysis with machine learning to measure uncertainty.

"While the use of industrial robots (UIR) promotes economic growth, it inevitably also has an impact on the ecological environment. This research explores the relationship between UIR and ecological footprint based on data of 72 countries from 1993 to 2019. First, whether based on overall or sub-industry data we confirm that UIR reduces the ecological footprint. After considering a series of robustness tests such as sample self-selection bias and endogeneity, this conclusion still holds. Second, the mediation effect model shows that UIR reduces the ecological footprint through the time saving effect, green employment effect, and energy upgrading effect and increases the ecological footprint through the industry driving effect, and that the impact of UIR's reduction of the ecological footprint is dominant. Third, the moderating effect model shows that as the levels of economic development and human capital increase, UIR can more effectively reduce the ecological footprint. Fourth, in OECD countries and at a high quantile of the ecological footprint, the effect of UIR on reducing the ecological footprint is more obvious. This paper presents a new perspective for UIR to achieve economic development and ecological protection at the same time. Governments of various countries should actively seize the opportunity to develop industrial robots, continue to increase human capital investment, and accelerate the upgrade of energy sectors.",2,10.1016/j.ecolecon.2022.107483,"This research investigates the impact of industrial robots on the ecological footprint across 72 countries, employing various robustness tests and mediation effect models to analyze the relationship.

"Forecasting significance in the energy market is extremely high. Demand for electricity determines the key decisions on its purchase and production, load transfer and transmission control. Over the past few decades, several methods have been developed to accurately predict the future of energy consumption. This article discusses various methods for forecasting energy demand. Three blocks of methods are considered: statistical, methods using artificial intelligence and hybrid. Authors defined the metrics that show the quality of the models and help to compare the results of the models: mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), root-mean-square deviation (RMSE), minimum and maximum errors on the test sample. A comparative analysis of forecasting methods has been lunched on the open data set. The best result is obtained using a combined model based on the Lasso regression method. The accuracy and speed of predictions helps to get an economic effect from regulating generation by selling electricity at the peak of consumption.",2,10.1051/e3sconf/202021013036,"This paper reviews various methods for forecasting energy demand, categorizing them into statistical, AI-based, and hybrid approaches.

"The substantial increase in agricultural carbon emissions (ACEs) contributes significantly to global warming, and agricultural resource misallocation (ARM) plays a major role in the rise of ACEs. Therefore, the aim of developing modern agriculture is to reduce ARM and promote low- carbon agriculture. To achieve this, the double machine learning model (DML) and moderating effect model are adopted in the present study to explore the correlations between agricultural socialized services (ASS), ARM, and ACEs. Also, the ARM index is calculated using the panel data collected from 31 provinces during the 2004-2020 period in China. The research results are as follows. Firstly, ARM has a significant positive impact on ACEs at the 1% significance level. Secondly, ASS exerts significant negative regulatory effects on ARM and ACEs at the 1% significance level. Lastly, the goodness of fit (R2) 2 ) reaches 95% and 40% for DML and the fixed effect model (FEM), respectively. Relatively, DML performs better in the goodness of fit according to this study. Furthermore, it is found out in this study that land misallocation, labor misallocation and capital misallocation increase ACEs and impede the development of low-carbon agriculture. Also, as a regulatory variable, ASS mitigates the ARM-induced increase of ACEs. Therefore, these findings provide guidance on the development of low-carbon agriculture for ASS.",2,10.1016/j.iref.2024.103452,"This paper investigates the relationship between agricultural resource misallocation, agricultural socialized services, and agricultural carbon emissions using a double machine learning model and panel data analysis.

"Climate warming is expected to alter hydropower generation in California through affecting the annual stream-flow regimes and reducing snowpack. On the other hand, increased temperatures are expected to increase hydropower demand for cooling in warm periods while decreasing demand for heating in winter, subsequently altering the annual hydropower pricing patterns. The resulting variations in hydropower supply and pricing regimes necessitate changes in reservoir operations to minimize the revenue losses from climate warming. Previous studies in California have only explored the effects of hydrological changes on hydropower generation and revenues. This study builds a long-term hydropower pricing estimation tool, based on artificial neural network (ANN), to develop pricing scenarios under different climate warming scenarios. Results suggest higher average hydropower prices under climate warming scenarios than under historical climate. The developed tool is integrated with California's Energy-Based Hydropower Optimization Model (EBHOM) to facilitate simultaneous consideration of climate warming on hydropower supply, demand and pricing. EBHOM estimates an additional 5% drop in annual revenues under a dry warming scenario when climate change impacts on pricing are considered, with respect to when such effects are ignored, underlining the importance of considering changes in hydropower demand and pricing in future studies and policy making.
