"Platforms play an essential role in the modern economy. At the same time, due to advances in artificial intelligence (AI), algorithms are becoming more widely used for pricing and other business functions. Previous literature examined algorithmic pricing, but not in the context of network effects and platforms. Moreover, platform competition literature has not considered how algorithms may affect competition. We study the performance of AI pricing algorithms (Q-learning and Particle Swarm Optimization) and naïve algorithms (price-matching) under platform competition. We find that algorithms set an optimal price structure that internalizes network effects. However, no algorithm is always the best because profitability depends on the type of competing algorithms and market characteristics, such as differentiation and network effects. Additionally, algorithms learn autonomously when an equilibrium is unstable and avoid it. When algorithm adoption is an endogenous strategic decision, several algorithms can be adopted in equilibrium; we characterize the conditions for the various outcomes and show that the equilibrium and platform profits are sensitive to algorithm design changes. Overall, our research suggests that AI algorithms can be effective in the presence of network effects, and platforms are likely to adopt a variety of algorithms. Lastly, we reflect on the business value of AI and identify opportunities for future research at the intersection of AI algorithms and platforms. © The Author(s) 2024.",18,10.1007/s10660-024-09821-w,"This study examines the impact of AI pricing algorithms in platform competition, focusing on how these algorithms interact with network effects.

"Recently, several macro trends have converged to provide airlines new opportunities for one-to-one digital customer engagement and personalization. Airlines have more types and volumes of data available than ever before: shopping-behavior data, data providing context on booking decisions, social media data enriching the information available on travel trends, and more. All of these can play a critical role in defining the right offers and setting the right prices for each shopping request. A plethora of advanced AI and ML techniques have become available on open-source platforms, letting players generate actionable customer insights and leverage vast amounts of existing data. New distribution technology is being deployed to allow airlines to implement real-time retailing capabilities. Consumers have been trained by the likes of Amazon, Netflix, Alibaba, and Starbucks to expect products and services tailored to their individual needs along with superior and engaging content. This paper presents different approaches to price-product personalization that have been tested in airline cases globally. It also explores how the concept of experiential learning is nicely suited to tackling scenarios in which the purchaser is well-identified as well as cases in which not much is known about the visitor except the context of the shopping session. © 2023, The Author(s).",18,10.1057/s41272-022-00404-8,"This paper explores the use of AI and machine learning techniques in the airline industry for personalized pricing and product offers based on extensive customer data.

"A booming literature describes how artificial intelligence algorithms may autonomously learn to generate supra-competitive profits. The widespread interpretation of this phenomenon as “collusion” is based largely on the observation that one agent's unilateral price cuts are followed by several periods of low prices and profits for both agents, which is construed as the signature of a reward–punishment scheme. We observe that price hikes are also followed by aggressive price wars. Algorithms may also converge to outcomes that are worse than Nash and penalize deviations from it. While admissible in equilibrium, this behavior throws interesting light on the relationship between high algorithmic prices and the standard mechanisms behind (human) collusion. © 2024 The Authors",18,10.1016/j.econlet.2024.111661,"This paper explores the behavior of AI algorithms in a competitive market, particularly how they can lead to supra-competitive profits and exhibit patterns resembling collusion.

"The imperfect decision-making of human buyers participating in retail markets varies from fundamental models that assume rational economic choices: even in markets with identical items human buyers are not rational, i.e., buyers do not always choose the cheapest option. Recent developments in artificial intelligence and e-commerce enable market participation by software agents that are (almost) perfectly rational due to their computational capacity. However, the increasing degree of buyers’ rationality might have unfavorable effects on retail markets with regards to the competition between sellers and the resulting prices. In this paper, we study the effects of varying degrees of buyers’ rationality on the competition and the prices buyers face in retail markets with identical items. We use the multinomial logit function to model different degrees of buyers’ rationality. We further model the competition between sellers using k-level reasoning: each seller computes the price to offer (best response strategy) with regards to its belief for the competition. First, we derive an analytical best response strategy (price) of a seller given the competing prices and the degree of buyers’ rationality, and show that there exists an optimal degree of buyers’ rationality that minimizes the price. Last, we use evolutionary game theory to show that perfect rationality leads to unstable competition dynamics increasing the overall cost for buyers. In contrast, bounded rationality leads to smoother dynamics and lower cost for buyers. Our insights raise the need to revisit design objectives for software agents in retail markets in light of their wider systematic impact. © 2019, The Author(s).",18,10.1007/s10614-019-09955-2,"This paper examines the impact of varying degrees of buyers' rationality on competition and pricing in retail markets, contrasting human decision-making with that of rational software agents.

"The behavior of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms is shaped by how they learn about their environment. We compare the prices generated by AIs that use different learning protocols when there is market interaction. Asynchronous learning occurs when the AI only learns about the return from the action it took. Synchronous learning occurs when the AI conducts counterfactuals to learn about the returns it would have earned had it taken an alternative action. The two lead to markedly different market prices. When future profits are not given positive weight by the AI, (perfect) synchronous updating leads to competitive pricing, while asynchronous can lead to pricing close to monopoly levels. We investigate how this result varies when either counterfactuals can only be calculated imperfectly and/or when the AI places a weight on future profits. Lastly, we investigate performance differences between offline and online play. © 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",18,10.1111/jems.12516,"This paper compares the pricing outcomes of AI algorithms using different learning protocols (asynchronous vs. synchronous) in market interactions.

"The aim of this paper is to investigate how different degrees of sophistication in agents’ behavioral rules may affect individual and macroeconomic performances. In particular, we analyze the effects of introducing into an agent-based macro model firms that are able to formulate effective sales forecasts by using simple machine learning algorithms. These techniques are able to provide predictions that are unbiased and present a certain degree of accuracy, especially in the case of a genetic algorithm. We observe that machine learning allows firms to increase profits, though this result in a declining wage share and a smaller long-run growth rate. Moreover, the predictive methods are able to formulate expectations that remain unbiased when shocks are not massive, thus providing firms with forecasting capabilities that to a certain extent may be consistent with the Lucas Critique. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",18,10.1016/j.jedc.2022.104405,"This paper investigates the impact of machine learning algorithms on firms' sales forecasting within an agent-based macroeconomic model.

"Providing liquidity in over-the-counter markets is a challenging under-taking, in large part because a market maker does not observe where their competitors quote, nor do they typically know how many rivals they compete with or what the trader's overall liquidity demand is. Optimal pricing strategies can be derived in theory assuming full knowledge of the competitive environment, but these results do not translate into practice where information is incomplete and asymmetric. This paper studies whether artificial intelligence, in the form of multi-armed bandit reinforcement learning algorithms, can be used by liquidity providers to dynamically set spreads using only information that is commonly available to them. We also investigate whether collusive effects can arise when competing liquidity providers all employ such algorithms. Our findings are as follows. In a single-agent setup where only one liquidity provider is optimising pricing in an otherwise static environment, all the algorithms considered are able to locate the theoretically optimal pricing policy, albeit they do so quite inefficiently when compared to a model-based approach. In a multi-agent setting where competing liquidity providers simultaneously and independently use algorithms to optimise pricing, we demonstrate that for one class of algorithms (pseudo) collusion cannot arise, while for another it can arise in certain circumstances and we provide examples where it does. The scenarios where collusive effects appear, however, are fragile, sensitive to the specific configuration and exceedingly unlikely to occur in practice. Moreover, with a modest number of competitors, collusive effects that might otherwise arise in some of the most contrived scenarios are largely or entirely eliminated. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",18,10.1080/14697688.2022.2130087,"This paper explores the use of multi-armed bandit reinforcement learning algorithms by liquidity providers in over-the-counter markets to optimize pricing strategies under conditions of incomplete information.

"The traditional legal approach for distinguishing between illicit collusion and legitimate oligopoly conduct is to rely on criteria that relate to the means and form of how rivals interact, such as elements of ""practical cooperation"", or on the finding of an anticompetitive intent. These criteria ultimately refer to the inner sphere of natural persons and its emanations in communicative acts. Some authors therefore conclude that the cartel prohibition of Article 101 Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) or Section 1 of the U.S. Sherman Act is unable to capture collusion if it is achieved by autonomously acting computers relying on machine learning capabilities. It is instead suggested here to define collusion as parallel informational signals, which achieve a supracompetitive equilibrium, and to use the consumer welfare standard as a proxy for distinguishing between illicit collusion and legitimate oligopoly conduct. This approach is not tantamount to the idea of prohibiting tacit collusion as such. Rather, it is to check singular elements of communication, that is, ""informational signals"", within an existing oligopolistic setting for their propensity to create consumer harm. This approach can help to close potential regulatory gaps currently associated with the surge of algorithmic pricing. © 2019 The Author(s). Published by Oxford University Press.

"Revenue management (RM) has been a strategic priority for airlines for decades. More recently, ancillary revenues and targeted offers for diverse customers have become increasingly relevant. Hence, airlines need to evolve their RM into offer management, complementing flight pricing with dynamic bundling, ancillary pricing and assortment.

It develops a machine learning framework for highly granular customer segmentation, whilst addressing three potential challenges of data sparsity, curse of dimensionality, and model understandability.

"The impact of the COVID-19 on the industry has highlighted once again the need to create new ways of addressing consumers that would be less reliant on historic data, and more adjusted to recent observations of consumer behaviour, real time experiments and competitive context. This article addresses the implications of consumer behavioural economics in the design of offers and the way airlines will have to rethink the way they price in a New Distribution Capability (NDC) world, as defined by IATA. In a pandemic impacted era, this investment will show its fruits not only after, but also during the recovery phase, where travel behaviour is exceptionally different, capacity fluctuates and the competitive landscape is equally difficult to predict. We will discuss what challenges a pricing department is facing in this new world of offers, as well as how to overcome them in order to provide relevant and personalised offers to each consumer and price them according to the value that these offers bring. In the COVID-19 context as well as post-pandemic, airlines will need to not only respond quicker with capacity adjustments, but also to better understand human behaviour relative to a purchase decision and address each consumer with an optimised offer in real-time, as they request it. Some of the questions for which new artificial intelligence experimentation techniques and behavioural economics models will require significant development are: What drives a person to choose or not to choose a certain offer?

"Today airlines’ ancillary pricing decision-making is mostly manual, where prices are generally determined by analysts through competitor benchmarking and historical data analysis. After manual computation, ancillary prices are filed in ATPCO (Airline Tariff Publishing Company) or Merchandising systems and these prices can be further tailored to the characteristics of the ancillary request through merchandising rules. Using airline ancillary and itinerary data, we built a gradient boosting machine algorithm that can understand the intricate relations between numerous attributes such as passenger type, itinerary, aircraft type, ancillary product, or season and can make an automated pricing decision based on science. The analysts are relieved from manual work and have the flexibility to change the machine learning (ML) algorithm’s input and output to suit business strategies. The ML algorithm learns the new trends and patterns as part of its training, and analysts can track its performance periodically. The output of the ML algorithm seamlessly integrates with merchandising platforms to implement the dynamic pricing of ancillaries and offers in the direct, indirect, and channels with new distribution capability. The ML algorithm is extendable to airline and third-party ancillary products and ticket bundles. It can suggest an optimal mix of products and price points that have the highest propensity to purchase for a given customer and travel itinerary. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",18,10.1057/s41272-021-00347-6,"This paper develops a gradient boosting machine algorithm to automate ancillary pricing decisions in airlines, moving away from manual methods.

"Commercial airlines use revenue management systems to maximize their revenue by making real-time decisions on the booking limits of different fare classes offered in each of its scheduled flights. Traditional approaches—such as mathematical programming, dynamic programming, and heuristic rule-based decision models—heavily rely on external mathematical models of demand and passenger arrival, choice, and cancelation, making their performance sensitive to the accuracy of these model estimates. Moreover, many of these approaches scale poorly with increase in problem dimensionality. Additionally, they lack the ability to explore and “directly” learn the true market dynamics from interactions with passengers and adapt to changes in market conditions on their own. To overcome these limitations, this research uses deep reinforcement learning (DRL), a model-free decision-making framework, for finding the optimal policy of the seat inventory control problem. The DRL framework employs a deep neural network to approximate the expected optimal revenues for all possible state-action combinations, allowing it to handle the large state space of the problem. Multiple fare classes with stochastic demand, passenger arrivals, and booking cancelations have been considered in the problem. An air travel market simulator was developed based on the market dynamics and passenger behavior for training and testing the agent. The results demonstrate that the DRL agent is capable of learning the optimal airline revenue management policy through interactions with the market, matching the performance of exact dynamic programming methods. The revenue generated by the agent in different simulated market scenarios was found to be close to the maximum possible flight revenues and surpass that produced by the expected marginal seat revenue-b (EMSRb) method. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",18,10.1057/s41272-021-00281-7,"This research applies deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to optimize revenue management in commercial airlines by dynamically adjusting booking limits across fare classes.

"We investigate the ability of a platform to design its marketplace to promote competition, improve consumer surplus, and increase its own payoff. We consider demand-steering rules that reward firms that cut prices with additional exposure to consumers. We examine the impact of these rules both in theory and by using simulations with artificial intelligence pricing algorithms (specifically Q-learning algorithms, which are commonly used in computer science). Our theoretical results indicate that these policies (which require little information to implement) can have strongly beneficial effects, even when sellers are infinitely patient and seek to collude. Similarly, our simulations suggest that platform design can benefit consumers and the platform, but that achieving these gains may require policies that condition on past behavior and treat sellers in a nonneutral fashion. These more sophisticated policies disrupt the ability of algorithms to rotate demand and split industry profits, leading to low prices. © 2023 The Econometric Society.",18,10.3982/ECTA19978,This paper investigates how marketplace design can enhance competition and consumer surplus while benefiting the platform itself.

"We model how a technology that perfectly predicts one of two stochastic demand shocks alters the character and sustainability of collusion. Our results show that mechanisms that reduce firms’ uncertainty about the true level of demand have ambiguous welfare implications for consumers and firms alike. An exogenous improvement in firms’ ability to predict demand may make collusion possible where it was previously unsustainable or more profitable where it previously existed. However, an increase in transparency also may make collusion impracticable where it had been possible. The intuition for this ambiguity is that greater clarity about the true state of demand raises the payoffs both to colluding and to cheating.

"One of the most popular approaches to model choices in the airline industry is the multinomial logit (MNL) model and its variations because it has key properties for businesses: acceptable accuracy and high interpretability. On the other hand, recent research has proven the interest of considering choice models based on deep neural networks as these provide better out-of-sample predictive power. However, these models typically lack direct business interpretability. One useful way to get insights for consumer behavior is by estimating and studying the price elasticity in different choice situations. In this research, we present a new methodology to estimate price elasticity from Deep Learning-based choice models. The approach leverages the automatic differentiation capabilities of deep learning libraries. We test our approach on data extracted from a global distribution system (GDS) on European market data. The results show clear differences in price elasticity between leisure and business trips. Overall, the demand for trips is price elastic for leisure and inelastic for the business segment. Moreover, the approach is flexible enough to study elasticity on different dimensions, showing that the demand for business trips could become highly elastic in some contexts like departures during weekends, international destinations, or when the reservation is done with enough anticipation.

"Producing organic milk has been an alternative for conventional farmers who are struggling with low prices. However, organic dairy prices recently collapsed along with conventional prices when several large producers entered the organic market. The current study explores the patterns and determinants of organic dairy premiums. We estimate monthly price premiums for organic whole milk, other fluid milk, yogurt, and eggs over the period 2008–2017 using US retail scanner data. The premiums were 56%, 51%, 27%, and 38%, respectively, with annual compound growth rates of 8%, 7%, −1.42%, and −2.86%. We identify the determinants of price premiums with a vector autoregression to account for endogeneity and autocorrelation, and a machine-learning algorithm—extreme gradient boost—for data-driven insights. Holding the premiums fixed, growing input costs may induce organic sellers to sell more to compensate for costs.

"There is an increasing interest within the travel industry in better understanding customer behavior, particularly the way customers choose between itinerary alternatives when searching for flights. Such an understanding can help travel providers (e.g., airlines) adapt better to market conditions and customer needs, thus increasing their revenue. In this paper, we deal with the problem of modeling air passenger choice between flight itineraries. We describe a two-stage approach to predict travelers' choice behavior by combining machine learning and discrete choice-modeling techniques. The applicability of these models is then illustrated by employing them for dynamic pricing optimization. We conduct experiments on a dataset extracted from searches and bookings on several European markets, aiming at assessing both the accuracy of our customer models and the effect of price optimization. The proposed approach seems to be effective on both dimensions: (a) improved accuracy when predicting choice, and (b) increased expected revenue of shopping sessions.

"In the context of the application of artificial intelligence in an intellectual property trading platform, the number of demanders and suppliers that exchange scarce resources is growing continuously. Improvement of computational power promotes matching efficiency significantly. It is necessary to greatly reduce energy consumption in order to realize the machine learning process in terminals and microprocessors in edge computing (smart phones, wearable devices, automobiles, IoT devices, etc.) and reduce the resource burden of data centers. Machine learning algorithms generated in an open community lack standardization in practice, and hence require open innovation participation to reduce computing cost, shorten algorithm running time, and improve human-machine collaborative competitiveness. The purpose of this study was to find an economic range of the granularity in a decision tree, a popular machine learning algorithm. This work addresses the research questions of what the economic tree depth interval is and what the corresponding time cost is with increasing granularity given the number of matches. This study also aimed to balance the efficiency and cost via simulation. Results show that the benefit of decreasing the tree search depth brought by the increased evaluation granularity is not linear, which means that, in a given number of candidate matches, the granularity has a definite and relatively economical range. The selection of specific evaluation granularity in this range can obtain a smaller tree depth and avoid the occurrence of low efficiency, which is the excessive increase in the time cost. Hence, the standardization of an AI algorithm is applicable to edge computing scenarios, such as an intellectual property trading platform.

"We study the welfare implications of personalized pricing implemented with machine learning. We use data from a randomized controlled pricing field experiment to construct personalized prices and validate these in the field. We find that unexercised market power increases profit by 55%. Personalization improves expected profits by an additional 19% and by 86% relative to the nonoptimized price.

"A consumer's web-browsing history, now readily available, may be much more useful than demographics for both targeting advertisements and personalizing prices. Using a method that combines economic modeling and machine learning methods, I find a striking difference. Personalizing prices based on web-browsing histories increases profits by 12.99%. Using demographics alone to personalize prices raises profits by only 0.25%, suggesting the percent profit gain from personalized pricing has increased 50-fold. I then investigate whether regulations intended to prevent price gouging increase aggregate consumer surplus.

"In recent years, important concerns have been raised about the increasing capabilities of pricing algorithms to make use of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. Two issues have gained particular attention: algorithmic price discrimination (PD) and algorithmic tacit collusion (TC). Although the risks and opportunities of both practices have been explored extensively in the literature, neither has yet been observed in the actual practice. As a result, there remains much confusion as to the ability of algorithms to engage in potentially harmful behavior with respect to price discrimination and collusion. In this article, we embed the economic and legal literature on these topics in a technological grounding to provide a more objective account of the capabilities of current AI technologies to engage in price discrimination and collusion. We argue that attention to these current technological capabilities should more directly inform on-going discussions on the urgency to reform legal rules or enforcement practices governing algorithmic PD and TC. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",18,10.1007/s10657-020-09662-6,"This article examines the implications of AI technologies in pricing algorithms, focusing on algorithmic price discrimination and tacit collusion.

"Internet advertising exchanges possess three characteristics-fast delivery, low values, and automated systems-that influence market design. Automated learning systems induce the winner's curse when several pricing types compete. Bidders frequently compete with different data, which induces randomization in equilibrium. Machine learning causes the value of information to leak across participants. Discrimination may be used to induce efficient exploration, although publishers (websites) may balk at participating. The creation of ""learning accounts,"" which divorce payments from receipts, may be used to internalize learning externalities.

"Increasingly, algorithms are supplanting human decision- makers in pricing goods and services. To analyze the possible consequences, we study experimentally the behavior of algorithms powered by Artificial Intelligence (Q- learning) in a workhorse oligopoly model of repeated price competition. We find that the algorithms consistently learn to charge supracompetitive prices, without communicating with one another. The high prices are sustained by collusive strategies with a finite phase of punishment followed by a gradual return to cooperation.

"Transaction efficiency is critical to the success of e-commerce platforms. We propose a Reverse Double Auction Mechanism (RDouMech), an innovative auction-based algorithm, to revolutionize the transaction process in e-commerce operations. It incorporates unique features of reverse auction, multi-bids, and multi-constraints (i.e., market clearing, individual rationality, and incentive compatibility). This operational innovation facilitates market clearing by precisely matching buyers with sellers, leading to a balance between demand and supply, improved matching rates between buyers and sellers, and a significant increase in transaction prices on the platform.

"Problem definition: Generating recommendations of compatible dating partners is a challenging task for online dating platforms because uncovering users’ idiosyncratic preferences is difficult. Thus, platforms tend to recommend popular users to others more frequently than unpopular users. This paper studies such popularity bias in an online dating platform’s recommendations and its consequences for users’ likelihood of finding dating partners. Methodology/results: Motivated by the empirical evidence that a user’s chance of being recommended by the platform’s algorithm increases significantly with the user’s popularity, we study an online dating platform’s incentive that generates popularity bias by modeling the platform’s recommendations and users’ subsequent interactions in a three-stage matching game. Our analysis shows that the recommendations that maximize the platform’s revenue and those that maximize the number of successful matches between users are not necessarily at odds, even though the former leads to a higher bias against unpopular users. Unbiased recommendations result in significantly lower revenue for the platform and fewer matches when users’ implicit cost of evaluating incoming messages is low. Popular users help the platform generate more revenue and a higher number of successful matches as long as these popular users do not become “out of reach.” We validate our theoretical results by running simulations of the platform based on a machine learning–based predictive model that estimates users’ behavior. Managerial implications: Our result indicates that an online dating platform can increase revenue and users’ chances of finding dating partners simultaneously with a certain degree of bias against unpopular users. Online dating platforms can use our theoretical results to understand user behavior and our predictive model to improve their recommendation systems (e.g., by selecting a set of users leading to the highest probabilities of matching or other revenue-generating interactions). © 2023 INFORMS.",18,10.1287/msom.2022.0132,This paper examines popularity bias in recommendations on online dating platforms and its effects on user interactions and platform revenue.

"This paper studies an emerging subscription model called ship-then-shop. Leveraging its predictive analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) capability, the ship-then-shop firm curates and ships a product to the consumer, after which the consumer shops (i.e., evaluates product fit and makes a purchase decision). The consumer first pays the up-front ship-then-shop subscription fee prior to observing product fit and then pays the product price afterward if the consumer decides to purchase. We investigate how the firm balances the subscription fee and product price to maximize its profit when consumers can showroom. A key finding is the ship-then-shop firm’s nonmonotonic surplus extraction strategy with respect to its prediction capability. As prediction capability increases, the firm first switches from ex ante to ex post surplus extraction (by lowering fees and raising prices). However, if the prediction capability increases further, the firm reverts to ex ante surplus extraction (by raising fees and capping prices). We also find that the ship-then-shop model is most profitable when (i) the prediction capability is advanced, (ii) the search friction in the market is large, or (iii) the product match potential is large. Finally, we show that the marginal return of AI capability on the firm’s profit decreases in search friction but increases in product match potential.

"Through repeated interactions, firms today refine their understanding of individual users’ preferences adaptively for personalization. In this paper, we use a continuous-time bandit model to analyze firms that recommend content to multihoming consumers, a representative setting for strategic learning of consumer preferences to maximize lifetime value. In both monopoly and duopoly settings, we compare a forward-looking recommendation algorithm that balances exploration and exploitation to a myopic algorithm that only maximizes the quality of the next recommendation. Our analysis shows that, compared with a monopoly, firms competing for users’ attention focus more on exploitation than exploration. When users are impatient, competition decreases the return from developing a forward-looking algorithm. In contrast, development of a forward-looking algorithm may hurt users under monopoly but always benefits users under competition. Competing firms’ decisions to invest in a forward-looking algorithm can create a prisoner’s dilemma.

"Although lenient return policies can drive sales and customer loyalty, they have also resulted in enormous returns volumes and reverse logistics costs. Online retailers often feel compelled to offer free returns, but are then faced with numerous operational challenges, ranging from accurately forecasting returns volumes to identifying presales strategies to reduce the likelihood that a (costly) return occurs. In this research, we consider how the complementarity of the products within an order basket is related to consumer returns. By developing an understanding of the link between basket contents and returns, we can improve order-level returns forecasts, while also providing insights into the effect of basket recommendations on the expected return rate. We take a multimethod approach to this problem. First, we use a stylized model to generate theoretical predictions regarding how within-basket complementarity should influence return probability. Next, we propose a data-driven measure of complementarity, degree of copurchase (DCP), which is based on the machine learning concept of association rule and is implementable using standard retail sales data. Finally, utilizing a unique data set provided by a leading online specialty retailer, we implement the DCP measure and test the predictions of our analytical model. We find, as expected, that there is a decreasing relationship between within-basket complementarity and return probability. However, we also show that this decrease is convex, indicating that the return probability impact is more notable when the complementarity is increased from a lower base.

"Regular prices and temporary discounts are important elements for retailers’ and brands’ pricing decisions. These two variables need to be considered separately because consumer sensitivities to their changes typically differ. Although the scope and richness of retail datasets have grown rapidly in recent years, most of them only record actual prices paid by customers and lack direct information about regular prices and discounts. A systematic review involving close to five hundred publications that investigated pricing variables using retail scanner data confirms this, as 63% of them only observed actual prices. To solve this missing data problem, these studies often adopted heuristics to decompose actual prices into regular prices and discount depths. However, there are many such heuristics and their accuracies have not been assessed.

"The facilitation of information technology has led to the rapid development of online-to-offline commerce, and this mode is attracting increasing businesses to enter the market. Its unique on-demand features affect consumers’ shopping behaviors. This study uses a difference-in-difference approach with propensity score matching and machine learning approaches to examine the impact of a new giant online-to-offline entrant on consumers’ ordering and spending behavior. We find that overall, the new entrant has a negative impact on consumers’ ordering and spending from the perspective of existing providers. This negative impact is amplified if the consumers are highly engaged on the platform. However, the new entrant effect is reduced if the providers use in-house rather than outsourced deliverymen or consumers have a relatively long distance from the new entrant. Furthermore, the new entrant effect is altered if the platform implements technological innovation. On a provider level, the new entrant has a direct negative impact on consumers’ ordering and spending from homogenous providers; however, a positive spillover effect is observed in terms of increasing consumers’ spending on heterogeneous providers. The direct effect occurs immediately, while the spillover effect appears in a time-lagged pattern. On a product level, we find that the new entrant negatively affects consumers’ ordering and spending on substitute products also sold by the new entrant, but that their spending on non-substitute products is boosted.

"Consumer behavior has become an important factor affecting enterprise′ s decision-making. Nowadays, with the wide application of big data technology and artificial intelligence, retailers can easily identify consumers which can create opportunities to implement differential pricing for different consumers. More specifically, consumers′ re-purchasing behavior will be affected by consumers′ attitude towards products, such as habitual difference and preference of consumers. In addition, the switching cost also affects both consumer behavior and enterprise decision, so it will be taken as one of the research factors in this paper. In order to study the influence of price discrimination and consumers′ product habitual difference on products on firms′ pricing strategies, this paper constructs two-period dynamic game based on the Hotelling′s idea. In the first period, duopoly firms compete on price and gain their market shares, and segment the market based on consumer information in case of the influence of price discrimination and switching cost on pricing decisions in the second period. After that, we figure out the optimal strategy of manufacturer and retailer in different situations. Firstly, we consider the pricing strategies with consumers′ product habitual difference on products. By using reverse induction, we obtain the pricing strategies of the enterprises in the second period, and then figure out the pricing strategies of the first period. It′s turned out that there exists a unique Nash equilibrium and the optimal equilibrium solution. Obviously, it can be found that consumers′ product habitual difference on products affects the pricing behavior of firms. The duopoly firms implement the similar pricing strategy to each other for their consumers, and they charge the same price to the same category of consumers. In the first period, no discrimination against consumers from the two firms is considered, while both of them price new and old consumers differently in the second period. In particular, the two firms both make low price strategy for new customers and high price strategy for old customers. We can also conclude that the pricing based on the habitual purchase behavior of consumers will benefit firms to obtain higher profits. Secondly, we comprehensively consider the pricing strategies of the duopoly firms in the case of consumers′ product habitual difference on products and switching costs. The switching cost is put into the consumer utility model in this case. Similarly, we also get a unique Nash equilibrium and optimal equilibrium solution by using reverse induction. The results show that the switching cost significantly influences the firm′s decision-making behavior and consumer purchasing behavior, and the firms do not adopt the same price to the consumers of the same category. However, the firms still carry out the discriminatory pricing strategy in the second period, and the switching cost increases the degree of discrimination against new and old customers. Under the dual influence of consumers′ product habitual difference on products and switching cost, the firm with switching cost has the advantage of product price in the first period. Furthermore, the firm who set switching costs ends up with higher profits. Finally, we compare the equilibrium results of the two models. The conclusions are given as follows. 1) The switching cost affects the pricing strategy with considering consumers′ product habitual difference, and it only affects the consumers who are going to switch. 2) The switching cost reduces the profit of firms with considering consumers′ product habitual difference, and the firm with switching cost has less negative effect than the firm without considering the switching cost. 3) Under the two strategies, the product price and profit are both proportional to the transportation cost. 4) As an important factor, the extra utility obtained by consumers affects the price and profit of the firms. Regardless of the strategy, the prices and profits of the same nature are equally affected by consumer′s extra utility. In summary, this paper studies a differentiated pricing competition by establishing a two-period dynamic pricing model in which the duopoly firms discriminate against different types of consumers. We integrate the switching cost and extra utility due to consumers′ product habitual difference into the basic setting. The research in this paper expands the application field of revenue management theory and method, and enriches the results of consumer behavior in terms of dynamic pricing strategy. In addition, it is helpful for firms to design a reasonable operation strategy to improve their corporate performance in practice. © (2023).

"We propose a human-machine hybrid approach to automating decision making in high human-interaction environments and apply it in the business-to-business (B2B) retail context. Using sales transactions data from a B2B aluminum retailer, we create an automated version of each salesperson, which learns and automatically reapplies the salesperson’s pricing policy. In a field experiment with the B2B retailer, we provide salespeople with their own model’s price recommendations in real time. We find that, despite the loss of private salesperson information, reducing intertemporal behavioral biases by providing the model’s price to the salesperson increases profits for treated quotes by 11% relative to a control condition. Using counterfactual analyses, we show that although the model’s pricing leads to higher profitability in most cases, salespeople generate higher profits when pricing out-of-the-ordinary or complex quotes. Accordingly, we propose a machine learning hybrid pricing strategy with two levels of automation. First, a random forest model automatically allocates quotes to either the model or the salesperson based on its prediction of whose pricing would generate higher profits. Then, if the quote is allocated to the model, the model determines the price.

"The primary objective of this study is to create an advanced management system that seamlessly integrates ChatGPT, an intelligent chatbot, with a cutting-edge two-stage auctions model. This integration aims to optimize the recycling process of electric vehicle batteries, ensuring utmost efficiency. To gauge the effect of incorporating ChatGPT on participants' values, we introduce technology coefficient parameters, providing a deeper understanding of its impact. In the initial phase of the auction, a sophisticated platform or an impartial third-party appraisal firm is employed. Their task is to collect vital attribute information from potential sellers regarding the waste batteries. Subsequently, this information is carefully matched with interested buyers. To determine the appropriate number of buyers both before and after the auction, we introduce two innovative matching mechanisms. We propose the implementation of a pioneering one-sided affine VCG (Vickrey-Clarke-Groves) auction, which portrays the affine externality of buyers to other buyers, along with a weighted generalized second-price auction. Additionally, we introduce a ground-breaking mechanism known as weighted multi-unit trade reduction. This inventive process allows successful bidders from the first stage to actively participate in the subsequent auction. Within this paper, we develop auction allocation rules based on the interplay between winning sellers' supply and winning buyers' demand. The outcomes of our numerical studies demonstrate the efficacy of the two-stage auction method in addressing buyers' concerns regarding battery performance. Furthermore, we have found that the utilization of ChatGPT technology proves advantageous for both participants and the platform; if buyers have a positive affine externality on other buyers, then the platform's revenue will be reduced, while social welfare will increase. In the realm of incentive compatibility, individual rationality, and budget balancing, our proposed mechanism stands unwaveringly strong, having undergone rigorous scrutiny and demonstrating commendable performance in numerous numerical experiments.

"Research Summary: The reach of the modern enterprise relies on the power of information technology (IT) tools such as sensors, databases, and machine learning. But tool improvements must be fueled by increased computing power (e.g., faster hardware) or getting more productivity from existing systems (e.g., through better computer algorithms). New research has uncovered that this second source, algorithm progress, is more important than previously realized—sometimes orders of magnitude more important than hardware—and thus could be an important technological stepping-stone to give competitive advantage to a country's firms. Analyzing this “Algorithm Commons” reveals that the United States has been the largest contributor to algorithm progress, with universities and large private labs (e.g., IBM) leading the way, but that U.S. leadership has faded in recent decades. Managerial Summary: Companies are increasingly tackling problems with big data and sophisticated analysis techniques (e.g., Machine Learning). To meet the increased computational demands of these approaches, the capability of computers must improve. One important technique for doing this is to redesign algorithms, the recipes that computers follow to perform calculations. As a result, firms that develop better algorithms, or get access to them first, can get important advantages over their competitors. This paper shows that it is U.S. corporations and U.S. universities that have produced most of the important algorithm improvements, and thus suggests that better algorithms may have been a source of advantage for U.S. multinationals. © 2020 The Authors.

"Artificial intelligence-powered recommendation systems have gained popularity as a tool to enhance user experience and boost sales. Platforms often need to make decisions about which seller to recommend and the strength of the recommendation when conducting recommendations. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the recommendation strategy of the platform in the case of duopoly competition. We develop a game model where two competing manufacturers sell products through an agency contract on a common platform, and they can decide whether or not to provide recommendations to the manufacturers. Our highlight lies in the endogenous recommendation strength of the platform. The findings suggest that it is optimal for the platform to offer recommendation services when the commission rate is high. The platform also prefers to only recommend one manufacturer in the market with low or high competition, but it prefers to recommend both manufacturers in moderately competitive markets. From the view of manufacturers, they can benefit from the recommendation service as long as the commission rate is not too low. Moreover, recommending only one manufacturer consistently yields stronger recommendations compared to recommending multiple manufacturers. However, the impact of recommendation on prices is influenced by the commission rate and product substitutability. These results have significant implications for platform decision making and provide valuable insights into the trade-offs involved in the development of recommendation systems. © 2023 by the authors.",18,10.3390/jtaer18020055,"This paper develops a game model to analyze the recommendation strategies of platforms in a duopoly market, focusing on the strength of recommendations and commission rates.

"Artificial intelligence (AI) clearly can benefit standard business models, in which firms sell products to buyers. But the outcomes of greater reliance on AI in peer-to-peer marketplaces, also known as lateral exchange markets (LEMs), might differ. Deploying AI likely improves outcomes for buyers and sellers (separately), as well as the effectiveness of their matching. In contrast, contingencies related to the power of the LEM and the presence and interaction of buyers and sellers (consociality) may evoke a dark side of AI. Guided by literature on LEMs, AI, and agency theory, the current work establishes buy- and sell-side tensions that arise when LEMs deploy AI.

"Ancillaries are a rapidly growing source of revenue for airlines, yet their prices are currently statically determined using rules of thumb and are matched only to the average customer or to customer groups. Offering ancillaries at dynamic and personalized prices based on flight characteristics and customer needs could greatly improve airline revenue and customer satisfaction. Through a start-up (Deepair) that builds and deploys novel machine learning techniques to introduce such dynamically priced ancillaries to airlines, we partnered with a major European airline, Galactic Air (pseudonym), to build models and algorithms for improved pricing. These algorithms recommend dynamic personalized ancillary prices for a stream of features (called context) relating to each shopping session. Our recommended prices are restricted to be lower than the human-curated prices for each customer group. We designed and compared multiple machine learning models and deployed the best-performing ones live on the airline’s booking system in an online A/B testing framework.

"Humans are increasingly interacting in and operating their daily lives through structured digital and virtual environments, mainly through apps that provide media for sharing photos, messaging, gaming, collaborating, or video watching. Most of these digital environments are offered under “freemium” pricing to facilitate adoption and network effects. In these settings, users' early social interaction and experience often have a substantial impact on their longer term behavior. On this background, we study the impact of an algorithmic system that matches new users to existing communities in an assortative manner. We devise a machine learning-based matching system that identifies users with high expected value and provides them the option to join highly active, in terms of engagement and expenditure, teams. We deploy this mechanism experimentally in a digital social game and find that it significantly increases user engagement, spending, and socialization. This finding holds for more active communities and overall. Teams matched with low-activity new users are negatively impacted, leading to an overall more segregated social environment. We argue that social experience and social behavior in groups are likely mechanisms that drive the impact of the matching system.

"We analyze the private equilibrium of a two-sided market representing the online gaming industry under a principal-agent model. A monopoly-holding platform hires a manager to attract new members from both sides of the market while considering uncertainty on the adhesion of viewers and online gamers. First, we mathematically demonstrate that increasing cross-group network externalities can decrease the platform’s profit, which contradicts a canonical result from the field of two-sided markets. Moreover, knowing that the intermediary’s goal is aligned with the private interest of online gamers, machine learning models empirically show that the main theoretical outcome is observed in reality due to the presence of heterogeneous indirect network effects in online gaming activities. Second, we conclude that social welfare can be either harmed or improved for increasing cross-group network externalities, which means that the professionalization of online gaming may or may not be legitimized depending on the value taken by exogenous parameters related to the platform’s uncertainty on the number of agents that get on board, risk aversion of viewers, and royalty rate applied to online gamers.

"We present our work with an online retailer, Rue La La, as an example of how a retailer can use its wealth of data to optimize pricing decisions on a daily basis. Rue La La is in the online fashion sample sales industry, where they offer extremely limited-time discounts on designer apparel and accessories. One of the retailer's main challenges is pricing and predicting demand for products that it has never sold before, which account for the majority of sales and revenue. To tackle this challenge, we use machine learning techniques to estimate historical lost sales and predict future demand of new products. The nonparametric structure of our demand prediction model, along with the dependence of a product's demand on the price of competing products, pose new challenges on translating the demand forecasts into a pricing policy. We develop an algorithm to efficiently solve the subsequent multiproduct price optimization that incorporates reference price effects, and we create and implement this algorithm into a pricing decision support tool for Rue La La's daily use. We conduct a field experiment and find that sales does not decrease because of implementing tool recommended price increases for medium and high price point products. Finally, we estimate an increase in revenue of the test group by approximately 9.7% with an associated 90% confidence interval of [2.3%, 17.8%]. © 2016 INFORMS.",18,10.1287/msom.2015.0561,"This paper focuses on using machine learning to optimize pricing decisions for an online retailer, Rue La La, particularly for new products.

"Pricing managers at online retailers face a unique challenge. They must decide on real-time prices for a large number of products with incomplete demand information. The manager runs price experiments to learn about each product’s demand curve and the profitmaximizing price. In practice, balanced field price experiments can create high opportunity costs, because a large number of customers are presented with suboptimal prices. In this paper, we propose an alternative dynamic price experimentation policy. The proposed approach extends multiarmed bandit (MAB) algorithms from statistical machine learning to include microeconomic choice theory. Our automated pricing policy solves this MAB problem using a scalable distribution-free algorithm. We prove analytically that our method is asymptotically optimal for any weakly downward sloping demand curve. In a series of MonteCarlo simulations,we showthat the proposed approach performs favorably compared with balanced field experiments and standard methods in dynamic pricing from computer science. In a calibrated simulation based on an existing pricing field experiment, we find that our algorithm can increase profits by 43% during the month of testing and 4% annually. © 2019 INFORMS.",18,10.1287/mksc.2018.1129,This paper develops a dynamic pricing experimentation policy using multiarmed bandit algorithms to optimize pricing decisions in online retail.

"Mobile in-app advertising is now the dominant form of digital advertising. Although these ads have excellent user-tracking properties, they have raised concerns among privacy advocates. This has resulted in an ongoing debate on the value of different types of targeting information, the incentives of ad networks to engage in behavioral targeting, and the role of regulation. To answer these questions, we propose a unified modeling framework that consists of two components—a machine learning framework for targeting and an analytical auction model for examining market outcomes under coun-terfactual targeting regimes. We apply our framework to large-scale data from the leading in-app ad network of an Asian country. We find that an efficient targeting policy based on our machine learning framework improves the average click-through rate by 66.80% over the current system. These gains mainly stem from behavioral information compared with contextual information. Theoretical and empirical counterfactuals show that although total surplus grows with more granular targeting, the ad network’s revenues are nonmonotonic; that is, the most efficient targeting does not maximize ad network revenues. Rather, it is maximized when the ad network does not allow advertisers to engage in behavioral targeting. Our results suggest that ad networks may have economic incentives to preserve users’ privacy without external regulation. © 2020 INFORMS.",18,10.1287/mksc.2020.1235,This paper develops a unified modeling framework combining machine learning for targeting and an analytical auction model to analyze mobile in-app advertising.

"Despite the recent explosive growth of online education, it still suffers from suboptimal learning efficacy, as evidenced by low student completion rates.

"Failing to sell fresh produce before expiration not only hurts the bottom line of grocery retailers, but also leads to food waste. This work combines dynamic pricing and information disclosure to help retailers to effectively sell fresh produce and promote sustainability. We focus on a quality-based pricing strategy and whether retailers should disclose information on food quality to customers. We consider a model where a monopolistic retailer sells fresh produce to customers who have different perceptions about food quality within a given time period. We employ a deep reinforcement learning algorithm to derive the optimal pricing and information strategies. Our simulation results show that a quality-based pricing strategy yields lower prices than a pricing strategy that does not consider quality. Lower prices drive demand, thus improving profits and reducing food waste. Additionally, we show that, when an information strategy is allowed, the prices in a quality-based pricing strategy stay the same or even increase during the selling season. This is because information disclosure helps align customers’ biased perceptions on food quality with the actual levels. We show that a combination of quality-based pricing and information disclosure further improves profits and reduces food waste when a large portion of customers consider quality to be lower than actual levels.

"Retailers face significant pressure to improve revenue, margins and market share by applying price optimisation models. These are mathematical models that calculate how demand varies at different price levels, then combine that data with information on costs and inventory levels to recommend prices that will improve revenue and profits.

We have identified three important changes: (1) Data: availability of internal and external real-time data such as traffic to a website, consumers making buy/no buy decisions and competitor pricing strategies; (2) Analytics: advances in machine learning and ease of access (R, Python) have enabled the development of systems that learn on the fly about consumer behaviour and preferences and generate effective estimates of demand-price relationships; and (3) Automation: increase in computing speed enables real-time optimisation of prices of hundreds of competing products sold by the same retailer.

"Motivated by their increasing prevalence, we study outcomes when competing sellers use machine learning algorithms to run real-time dynamic price experiments. These algorithms are often misspecified, ignoring the effect of factors outside their control, for example, competitors’ prices. We show that the long-run prices depend on the informational value (or signal-to-noise ratio) of price experiments: if low, the long-run prices are consistent with the static Nash equilibrium of the corresponding full information setting. However, if high, the long-run prices are supra-competitive—the full information joint monopoly outcome is possible. We show that this occurs via a novel channel: competitors’ algorithms’ prices end up running correlated experiments. Therefore, sellers’ misspecified models overestimate the own price sensitivity, resulting in higher prices.

"Problem definition: Online retailers disclose product availability to influence customer decisions as a form of pressure selling designed to compel customers to rush into a purchase. Can the revelation of this information drive sales and profitability? We study the effect of disclosing product availability on market outcomes—product sales and returns—and identify the contexts where this effect is most powerful. Academic/practical relevance: Increasing sell-out is key for online retailers to remain profitable in the presence of thin margins and complex operations. We provide insights into how their information-disclosure policy—something they can tailor at virtually no cost—can contribute to this important objective. Methodology: We collaborate with an online retailer to procure a year of transaction data on 190,696 products that span 1,290 brands and 472,980 customers. To causally identify our results, we use a generalized difference-in-differences design with matching that exploits one policy of the firm: it discloses product availability only for the last five units. Results: The disclosure of low product availability increases hourly sales—they grow by 13.6%—but these products are more likely to be returned—product return rates increase by 17.0%. Because returns are costly, we also study net sales—product hourly sales minus hourly returns—which increase by 12.5% after the retailer reveals low availability. Managerial implications: The positive effects on sales and profitability amplify over wide assortments and when low-availability signals are abundantly visible and disclosed for deeply discounted products whose sales season is about to end. In addition, we propose a data-driven policy that exploits these results by using machine learning to prescribe the timing of disclosure of scarcity signals in order to boost sales without spiking returns.

"Dynamic pricing has evolved with technology from earlier price negotiations. To maximize revenue and provide specialized shopping experiences, businesses today use algorithms and data analysis to adapt prices. We define dynamic pricing as price changes that are prompted by changes or differences in four key underlying market demand drivers: (1) People (i.e., individual consumers or consumer segments), (2) Product configurations, (3) Periods (i.e., time), and (4) Places (i.e., locations). The transition from static pricing (uniform prices) to dynamic pricing (changing prices) is evident from different examples, such as online retailers personalizing offers based on customer behavior, and algorithms using facial recognition for personalized pricing in physical stores. Fueled by AI and machine learning algorithms, dynamic pricing is transforming industries from transportation to e-commerce, optimizing revenue and enhancing customer experiences.

"This study examines a duopoly market comprising an online retail platform and a physical store, both of them selling experience-based products to consumers who are unaware of the products’ fitness. The platform could introduce artificial intelligence (AI) technology into retail operations to address consumers’ fitness uncertainty and then gain market share, while the physical store could exert a service effort to recapture the market, potentially facilitating showrooming behavior. Operational decisions including pricing, AI application, and service effort exertion are investigated in the cases where consumers are allowed and unallowed to return unsuitable products. We first develop a theoretical model of dual-channel retailing to determine the equilibrium operational decisions for the supply chain members, and then examine the interactions between these operational decisions and consumers’ showrooming behaviors. Subsequently, we perform numerical simulations to verify the robustness of the theoretical findings. Results indicate that both AI application and service efforts exertion will strengthen consumers’ showrooming effect, especially when the cost of AI application is relatively low. Moreover, regardless of whether the store implements the service effort or not, the platform prefers to apply AI technology when consumers are allowed to return products. Furthermore, the physical store will always exert a service effort, and with the service effort, the application of AI technology in the retail platform operation could effectively mitigate the impact of consumer return on supply chain members. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",18,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103409,"This study analyzes a duopoly market involving an online platform and a physical store, focusing on how AI technology can influence operational decisions and consumer behavior regarding product returns.

"Pricing decisions are increasingly in the hands of artificial algorithms. Scholars and competition authorities have voiced concerns that those algorithms are capable of sustaining collusive outcomes more effectively than can human decision makers. If this is so, then our traditional policy tools for fighting collusion may have to be reconsidered. We discuss these issues by critically surveying the relevant law, economics, and computer science literature.",18,10.1007/s11151-019-09689-3,"This paper critically surveys the literature on the implications of algorithmic pricing on collusion, highlighting concerns about the effectiveness of traditional policy tools in regulating algorithm-driven collusive behavior.

"Increasingly, algorithms are supplanting human decision-makers in pricing goods and services. To analyze the possible consequences, we study experimentally the behavior of algorithms powered by Artificial Intelligence (Q-learning) in a workhorse oligopoly model of repeated price competition. We find that the algorithms consistently learn to charge supracompetitive prices, without communicating with. one another. The high prices are sustained by collusive strategies with a finite phase of punishment followed by a gradual return to cooperation. This finding is robust to asymmetries in cost or demand, changes in the number of players, and various forms of uncertainty.",18,10.1257/aer20190623,"This paper experimentally analyzes the behavior of AI algorithms in an oligopoly pricing model, focusing on their ability to learn and sustain supracompetitive prices through collusive strategies.

"This paper explores the impact of using advanced technology such as artificial intelligence (AI) to match marketers with social media influencers. We develop a theoretical model to examine how matching accuracy affects the competition between influencers and the profitability of a social media platform. Our findings show that improving matching accuracy may not always benefit the platform, especially for platforms with intermediate follower density. Two opposing effects of technology improvement affect the prices of influencer marketing campaigns: advanced technology, such as AI, enhances the matching between influencers and marketers and also intensifies competition between different types of influencers. The overall effect on prices can be negative for some influencers because of the asymmetric nature of such matching technology: the matching outcome for influencers with a narrower audience (niche influencers) is more sensitive to matching accuracy than that for those with a broader audience (general influencers). As a result, more niche influencers begin to participate in marketing campaigns when matching accuracy improves, which reduces the prices offered by sufficiently general influencers and may lead to a decline in platform revenue. Additionally, we find that adjusting commission rates in response to technology improvements could help mitigate the negative impact although it may not eliminate it entirely. Our findings offer valuable insights for social media platforms seeking to remain competitive in the influencer marketing landscape.",18,10.1287/mksc.2023.0211,"This paper examines the impact of AI on matching marketers with social media influencers, focusing on how matching accuracy influences competition and profitability on social media platforms.

"We compare the performance of two approaches for finding the optimal set of products to display to customers landing on Alibaba's two online marketplaces, Tmall and Taobao. We conducted a large-scale field experiment, in which we randomly assigned 10,421,649 customer visits during a one-week-long period to one of the two approaches and measured the revenue generated per customer visit. The first approach we tested was Alibaba's current practice, which embeds product and customer features within a sophisticated machine-learning algorithm to estimate the purchase probabilities of each product for the customer at hand. The products with the largest expected revenue (revenue x predicted purchase probability) are then made available for purchase. Our second approach, which we developed and implemented in collaboration with Alibaba engineers, uses a featurized multinomial logit (MNL) model to predict purchase probabilities for each arriving customer. We used historical sales data to fit the MNL model, and then, for each arriving customer, we solved a cardinality-constrained assortment-optimization problem under the MNL model to find the optimal set of products to display. Our field experiments revealed that the MNL-based approach generated 5.17 renminbi (RMB) per customer visit, compared with the 4.04 RMB per customer visit generated by the machine-learning-based approach when both approaches were given access to the same set of the 25 most important features. This improvement represents a 28% gain in revenue per customer visit, which corresponds to a 4 million RMB improvement over the week in which the experiments were conducted. Motivated by the results of our initial field experiment, Alibaba then implemented a full-featured version of our MNL-based approach, which now serves the majority of customers in this setting. Using another small-scale field experiment, we estimate that our new MNL-based approach that utilizes the full feature set is able to increase Alibaba's annual revenue by 87.26 million RMB (12.42 million U.S. dollars).",18,10.1287/opre.2021.2158,"This study compares two approaches for optimizing product displays on Alibaba's marketplaces through a large-scale field experiment.

"Prices are increasingly set by algorithms. One concern is that intelligent algorithms may learn to collude on higher prices even in the absence of the kind of coordination necessary to establish an antitrust infringement. However, exactly how this may happen is an open question. I show how in simulated sequential competition, competing reinforcement learning algorithms can indeed learn to converge to collusive equilibria when the set of discrete prices is limited. When this set increases, the algorithm considered increasingly converges to supra-competitive asymmetric cycles. I show that results are robust to various extensions and discuss practical limitations and policy implications.",18,10.1111/1756-2171.12383,"This paper explores how reinforcement learning algorithms in a simulated market can learn to collude on higher prices, raising concerns about antitrust implications.

"This paper investigates pricing in laboratory markets when human players interact with an algorithm. We compare the degree of competition when exclusively humans interact to the case of one firm delegating its decisions to an algorithm, an n-player generalization of tit-for-tat. We further vary whether participants know about the presence of the algorithm. When one of three firms in a market is an algorithm, we observe significantly higher prices compared to human-only markets. Firms employing an algorithm earn significantly less profit than their rivals. (Un)certainty about the actual presence of an algorithm does not significantly affect collusion, although humans do seem to perceive algorithms as more disruptive.",18,10.1016/j.euroecorev.2022.104347,"This paper examines the effects of algorithmic pricing in laboratory markets, comparing human-only interactions to scenarios where one firm uses an algorithm.

"The role of advertising as an implicit price has long been recognized in economics and marketing, yet the effects of personalizing these implicit prices on firm profits and consumer welfare have not been explored. Using a large-scale field experiment on Pandora, we exogenously changed the ad load-the number of ads played per hour-for more than seven million users over 18 months. We find that the impact of ad load on consumption takes more than a year to stabilize, whereas subscription responses stabilize in less than six months. Using a machine-learning model, we analyze the heterogeneous effects of changing ad load on ad and subscription revenues. We then show that reallocating ads across users can enhance subscription profits by 7% without decreasing overall advertising profits. To achieve the same subscription rate with a uniform ad allocation policy, the firm would need to increase ad load by more than 22%. Our results show that, on average, consumer welfare drops by 2% with the proposed personalization strategy, and the effect seems to be more pronounced for users who have a higher willingness to pay.",18,10.1287/mksc.2022.0357,This paper investigates the effects of personalized advertising on firm profits and consumer welfare through a large-scale field experiment.

"Carnival Corporation & plc identified the need for a cutting-edge revenue management system; however, existing solutions from the airline and hospitality industries were not compatible with the idiosyncrasies of the cruise domain. As such, the company partnered with revenue analytics to build a complete revenue and inventory management system to meet its requirements. Yield optimization and demand analytics (YODA) is a system that leverages a unique quadratic programming model to jointly determine cruise prices and allocate cabin inventory to multiple cruises (e.g., 14-day and 7-day lengths) offered simultaneously on a given ship. The optimization inputs come from several machine learning algorithms that predict demand. YODA combines these algorithms with an elasticity model derived from an exponential curve to represent the unique price-sensitivity behavior observed in the cruise industry. The system generates millions of price recommendations each day and has been used to price voyages on 65 Carnival ships, approximately one quarter of the ships in the entire cruise industry, since December 2017. During A/B testing, YODA generated a 1.5%-2.5% incremental uplift in net ticket revenue, which is a significant revenue increase because Carnival was a Fortune 300 company in 2019.",18,10.1287/inte.2020.1062,"This paper describes the development of a revenue management system (YODA) for Carnival Corporation, which utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict demand and optimize pricing and inventory for cruise bookings.

"The widespread use of algorithmic technologies makes rules on tacit collusion, which are already controversial in antitrust law, more complicated. These rules have obvious limitations in effectively regulating algorithmic collusion. Although some scholars and practitioners within antitrust circles in the United States, Europe and beyond have taken notice of this problem, they have failed to a large extent to make clear its specific manifestations, root causes, and effective legal solutions. In this article, the authors make a strong argument that it is no longer appropriate to regard algorithms as mere tools of firms, and that the distinct features of machine learning algorithms as super-tools and as legal persons may inevitably bring about two new cracks in antitrust law. This article clarifies the root causes why these rules are inapplicable to a large extent to algorithmic collusion particularly in the case of machine learning algorithms, classifies the new legal cracks, and provides sound legal criteria for the courts and competition authorities to assess the legality of algorithmic collusion much more accurately. More importantly, this article proposes an efficacious solution to revive the market pricing mechanism for the purposes of resolving the two new cracks identified in antitrust law.",18,10.1093/joclec/nhz010,"This paper analyzes the implications of algorithmic technologies on antitrust law, particularly regarding tacit collusion and the limitations of existing regulations.
