"We investigate whether improvements in banks' organizational capital and control systems facilitate increased loan origination to minority borrowers. We focus on bank supervisors' enforcement decisions and orders (EDOs) against banks and hypothesize that EDO-imposed improvements in loan policies, internal governance, and employee training mitigate deficiencies in credit assessments and lending decisions that previously disadvantaged minority borrowers. We find that mortgage origination to minority borrowers increases following the resolution of EDOs, and more so for banks with stricter supervisors or more severe EDOs. Using a semisupervised machine learning method to analyze the text of EDOs, we find that such increases are higher for EDOs specifying revisions of loan policies, implementation of formal internal governance procedures, or more employee training. Overall, we find that EDO-driven improvements in organizational capital generate unintended, positive social externalities that enhance access to credit for minority borrowers. © 2024 The Chookaszian Accounting Research Center at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.",11,10.1111/1475-679X.12529,"This paper investigates the impact of banks' organizational capital improvements on loan origination to minority borrowers, particularly following enforcement decisions by supervisors.

"Nowadays, the dynamism caused by constant changes to strategic decisions in markets poses an additional difficulty in an organization’s management. The strategic decisions made by managers can easily become obsolete. One of the major difficulties in managing a commercial organization is predicting, with some precision, the impact some strategic decisions have on the financial results. Business intelligence (BI) is widely used to help managers make strategic decisions. However, the methods used to achieve the conclusions are kept secret by BI company-based services. Modeling the environment may help predict the impact of an action in a real environment. A good model should provide the most accurate result of an applied action in a given environment. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are proven to be excellent in modeling environments with very high data noise. The same strategic action can have different results when applied to different organizations. A tool that allows the evaluation of an applied strategic action in an environment will be of great importance in the field of management. Modeling the environment will save time and money for the organization, allowing the performance of the strategic plan to be improved. If one evaluates the state of the environment after a certain strategic action is applied, it can be possible to mitigate its risk of failure. As we will verify, it is possible to use ANNs to model strategic environments, allowing precision in the prediction of sales and operating results using particular strategies. © 2024 by the authors.",11,10.3390/jrfm17040164,"This paper explores the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) for modeling strategic environments to predict the impact of managerial decisions on financial outcomes.

"This article addresses the evolving dynamics of sustainability risks in the banking sector, with a particular focus on the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in risk assessment and management. The impact of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors on creditworthiness evaluation is examined and highlights the complexities and challenges that financial institutions face in adapting their risk management frameworks to accommodate these sustainability risks. The paper underscores the difficulties banks face in effectively incorporating ESG considerations, primarily due to the absence of standardized methodologies and the intricate interplay between ESG components and banking risk elements. In this context, the potential of AI applications is critically assessed, especially those utilizing large datasets, to identify complex patterns and correlations that often elude human analysts. This investigation includes both the opportunities AI presents in enhancing the precision of risk assessments and the associated challenges, including issues related to the opacity and control of complex, self-learning AI models, as well as regulatory and privacy concerns. Finally, the article presents a schematic approach through which banks can actively integrate sustainability risks into their risk management strategies, emphasizing the need for ongoing research and development in this crucial area.

"In this study, we investigate the impact of introducing enterprise relationship to train machine learning (ML) algorithms on improving its ability of forecasting small and medium-sized enterprises’ (SMEs) credit risk in supply chain finance (SCF). First, we incorporate attributes of SME node in the CEs-SMEs network, a bipartite network constructed with transaction data in the Chinese automobile industry, into financial indicators to train ML algorithms for improving forecasting performance. Second, we employ the weighted one-mode projection approach to extract a projected-SMEs network that reveals the relationship among SMEs from the CEs-SMEs network and examine whether the ML algorithms’ forecasting performances is improved when considering attributes in the projected-SMEs network. Third, we analyze the correlation between SME’s credit risk and individual network attribute to specifically understand the impact of enterprise relationship on credit risk. Overall, the empirical results indicate that the forecasting performance is obviously better when enterprise transaction relationship is considered, and it is further enhanced after we apply weighted one-mode projection approach. Meanwhile, the variable importance analysis and the binomial logistic regression demonstrate how significantly each network attribute is correlated with credit risk, and the discussion on partial dependence plot shows that SMEs with large degree are non-risky generally. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",11,10.1080/1540496X.2024.2324195,"This study investigates how incorporating enterprise relationships into machine learning algorithms enhances the forecasting of credit risk for SMEs in supply chain finance.

"Emerging economies, while exhibiting higher growth rates compared to developed countries, are susceptible to external shocks, leading to financial fragility. Traditional analysis methods often fall short in accuracy and timeliness. This research introduces a novel approach utilizing Back-Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) to predict financial fragility in emerging markets, focusing on the BRICS countries. By considering twelve impactful factors and employing Principal Component Analysis (PCA), five key influencers are identified. The BPNN model is iteratively optimized to achieve superior quality. Historical data validation attests to the model’s effectiveness. The study identifies five critical factors influencing financial fragility: GDP growth rate, inflation rate, monetary policy, interest rates, and bank’s capital-asset ratio. Among these, GDP growth rate emerges as a significant determinant. Positive growth is correlated with financial stability, while a slowdown or negative growth signals elevated risks. Emerging markets are particularly vulnerable to global economic fluctuations due to their reliance on exports and foreign capital. Additionally, weaker financial systems amplify their susceptibility to shocks.The research underscores the importance of building robust financial sectors, replenishing funding buffers, and proactively managing distressed assets in emerging market economies. The proposed BPNN model provides a powerful tool for risk prediction, though it requires strong indicator data support. While computational intensity and interpretability remain challenges, the benefits of BPNNs outweigh these limitations. Effective communication and information exchange across countries and markets are crucial for maintaining stability in emerging market finance. This study contributes valuable insights into the prediction of financial fragility in emerging markets, offering a comprehensive framework for policymakers and financial practitioners to navigate the challenges and opportunities presented by these dynamic economies. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",11,10.1007/s13132-023-01731-w,"This paper focuses on predicting financial fragility in emerging economies using a Back-Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) model.

"Purpose: The unemployment rate (UR) is the leading macroeconomic indicator used in the credit card loss forecasting. COVID-19 pandemic has caused an unprecedented level of volatility in the labor market variables, leading to new challenges to use UR in the credit risk modeling framework. This paper examines the dynamic relationship between the credit card charge-off rate and the unemployment rate over time. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses quarterly observations of charge-off rates on credit card loans of all commercial banks from Q1 1990 to Q4 2020. Univariate, multivariable, machine learning, and regime-switching time series modeling are employed in this research. Findings: The authors decompose UR into two components – temporary and permanent UR. The authors find the spike in UR during COVID-19 is mainly attributed to the surge in temporary layoffs. More importantly, the authors find that the credit card charge-off rate is primarily driven by permanent UR while temporary UR has little predictive power. During recessions, permanent UR seems to be a stronger indicator than total UR. This research highlights the importance of using permanent UR for credit risk modeling. Originality/value: The findings in the research can be applied to the credit card loss forecasting and CECL reserve models. In addition, this research also has implications for banks, macroeconomic data vendors, regulators, and policymakers. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",11,10.1108/MF-02-2022-0085,"This paper investigates the relationship between the unemployment rate (UR) and credit card charge-off rates, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Purpose: The theories of dividend decision have disentangled the firms’ critical drivers of the dividend announcement, and their performances are empirically evaluated by employing ordinary least squares (OLS). However, after more than half a century of research, the debate over the determinants of dividend policy in firms is inconclusive. Therefore, the current study attempted to contribute to the literature by exploring new insights into the dividend decisions of Indian firms by employing machine learning. Methodology: This study is based on secondary data, and empirical analysis has used a novel dataset of 919 listed Indian nonfinancial firms from 1999-2019. The study utilized the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and logistic regression methodologies. Findings: The findings revealed that the idiosyncratic variables are critically significant for dividend announcements by Indian firms. The results demonstrated that large, profitable, liquid, and firms with high market share were more likely to announce dividends in India than small, loss-making, illiquid, and low-market share firms. The direct relationship between Tobin’s Q and the likelihood of paying dividends is a new insight into the dividend decision for Indian firms. Practical Implications: The results will guide the dividend seeker investors to hold the shares of a high market share firm to receive the expected dividend.

The primary objective of this article is to assess the significance of financial management in contributing to the stability and profitability of organizations. To investigate the role and significance of financial management in ensuring the stability and profitability of organizations, this article analyzes the financial policies and management practices employed by prominent agricultural enterprises in Ukraine. The authors assess the financial stability and profitability indicators achieved through effective management of financial resources and decision-making by enterprise management. The study investigates the outcomes of consistent financial management strategies, policies, and tactics employed by agricultural enterprises during a period of heightened uncertainty and volatility in both domestic and international markets in 2022. These companies continued to prioritize sustainable development strategies, wherein the economic aspect aimed not only at ensuring sustainability and profitability but also at funding social and environmental initiatives. Financial management within the context of market volatility encompassed the following aspects: 1) conducting scenario analysis of the external environment and quantifying potential losses; 2) analyzing and assessing key financial risks such as currency, credit, and investment risks; 3) adapting financial management strategies to changes in macroeconomic factors; and 4) considering the environmental and social components as well as the costs associated with implementing relevant programs in financial practices. The surveyed companies exhibited variations in their dividend policies, with one company adopting a cautious dividend approach, while another experienced an increase in dividend payouts in 2022. Furthermore, these companies prioritized investment policies that emphasized innovation and technological advancements. Financial strategies implemented by agricultural enterprises encompassed growth, expansion, and international diversification.

"We aim to examine how the Large Language Model (LLM) can contribute to loan default prediction by extracting narrative data. Based on a Chinese FinTech lending platform dataset, we employ four LLMs to predict the probability of default (PD-LLM) based on the narrative data and use the PD-LLM as an additional feature to predict default loans. The empirical results show that the narrative data contain some extra credit information and can hardly be regarded as ‘cheap talks’. The extracted information via LLMs processes some predictive capability to predict default loan applications in both in- and out-of-sample analysis. The out-of-sample results indicate that including PD-LLM can significantly improve out-of-sample forecasting performance.

"In this paper, we applied machine learning techniques to analyze the default probability in financial institutions using a large dataset of variables collected from 2325 banks over 17 years, extracting the most relevant variables using a feature selection method, predicting default and systemic risk, and finally investigating the contributions of each relevant feature to the overall financial stress of banking institutions using explainable artificial intelligence techniques. We found that the most important variables for the default risk prediction include the bailout probability, the market share in terms of assets, and the market-to-book ratio, highlighting the relevance of issues like moral hazard and market leverage. On the other hand, for systemic risk prediction, the number of banks in the country and interest rates level are among the most relevant features, indicating that markets with more competition fare better against systemic risks.

"The bankruptcy of Russian companies in the existing environment has become rather common. Determination of bankruptcy risk factors allows predicting the prospects for business development. The authors set the task to determine the relative influence of individual financial and non-financial factors on the probability of a company’s bankruptcy. To study risk factors, the authors analyzed 3184 large Russian companies (with revenues of more than 2 billion rubles per year and more than 250 employees) of various industries operating from 2009 to 2020. The total number of observations is 38,208. For analysis, 30 factors were selected and divided into five groups: profitability, liquidity, turnover, financial stability and general (non-financial) factors. For the study, one of the machine learning methods was used — the random forest method. The sample consists of companies from seven industries, including manufacturing, retail, construction, electric power, mining, agricultural production, and water supply, as well as other industries, which include companies in education, healthcare, agriculture, and hospitality. The analysis was carried out both in aggregate for the entire sample without being distributed by industry, and for samples distributed by manufacturing, retail, and service industries. In the sample as a whole, the tested model in 86% of cases correctly predicted the possibility of a company going bankrupt for the period under review. This result confirmed that machine learning methods (in particular, the random forest algorithm) are highly effective in solving the problem of bankruptcy prediction for a company. Based on the data obtained, the paper concludes that profitability factors have the most significant impact on the probability of bankruptcy for manufacturing and retail companies. For service companies, it is financial stability factors.

The instability of debt structure reveals new costs of financial constraints: compared to high-credit-quality firms, low-credit-quality firms have to change debt structure more frequently to accommodate their financing needs, even with increased borrowing costs; low-credit-quality firms lack the opportunity available to high-credit-quality firms to reduce borrowing costs through switching debt instruments. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",11,10.1016/j.jfs.2021.100948,"This paper applies a machine-learning algorithm to analyze the debt structures of U.S. public firms, focusing on the frequency of changes in debt structure among firms with varying credit quality.

"The COVID-19 pandemic increased uncertainty about the financial future of many organizations, and regulators alerted auditors to be increasingly skeptical in assessing an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern. An auditor’s assessment of an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern is a matter of significant judgment. This paper proposes to use machine learning to construct a Decision Tree Automated Tool, based on both quantitative financial indicators (e.g., Z-scores) and qualitative factors (e.g., partners’ judgment and assessment of industry risk given the pandemic). Considering both quantitative and qualitative factors results in a model that provides additional audit evidence for auditors in their going-concern assessment. An auditing firm in Spain used the model as a supplemental guide, and the model’s suggested results were compared to auditors’ reports to evaluate its effectiveness and accuracy. The model’s predictions were significantly similar to the auditors’ assessments, indicating a high level of accuracy, and differences between the model’s proposed outcomes and auditors’ final conclusions were investigated.

"In an era where the knowledge economy plays a pivotal role, corporate financial distress poses substantial risks to various external stakeholders. Traditional financial distress prediction models often fall short in accuracy and transparency. Hence, we introduce a groundbreaking approach that leverages the power of ensemble learning models while addressing the challenges of class imbalance. We propose a comprehensive framework that enhances predictive performance and caters to external users’ needs for interpretability. We delve into the world of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) by incorporating techniques such as partial dependence plots (PDP), individual conditional expectations (ICE), and Shapley additive explanations (SHAP). These techniques provide global and local interpretations that help businesses, financial institutions, and regulators make informed decisions. We conduct empirical experiments using financial data from Polish companies, which show that the GBoost model with random oversampling (ROS) performs the best and demonstrates the validity of our approach. Local PDP interpretations help to identify key financial indicators that contribute to a firm’s financial distress, and ICE interpretations are exploited to provide strategies for improvement. Moreover, in terms of global interpretation, SHAP’s feature importance ranking and feature interaction results are consistent with the knowledge of financial experts, thus increasing the credibility of the black-box model.

"In the rapid development of modern enterprise economy, in the face of the development trend of economic globalization, enterprises are bound to deal with diversified financial risks.

"We explore the potential outcomes for financial stability when using peer-to-peer lenders to finance economic activity. Combining Random Regression Forests, a machine-learning process, with an agent-based model, we perform simulations on artificial economies with various degrees of adoption of peer-to-peer lending. We find that as peer-to-peer lenders proliferate, there is increased financial instability, lower GDP and higher unemployment. On the other hand, peer-to-peer lending increases the total volume of loans given out but demonstrates a preference towards consumer loans (over corporate loans), which has a negative effect in the long run. Finally, introducing peer-to-peer lenders increases the access of the unbanked to services which conventional banking is not able to offer within the extant regulatory framework.

"The forecasting of credit default risk has been an active research field for several decades. Historically, logistic regression has been used as a major tool due to its compliance with regulatory requirements: transparency, explainability, and fairness. In recent years, researchers have increasingly used complex and advanced machine learning methods to improve prediction accuracy. Even though a machine learning method could potentially improve the model accuracy, it complicates simple logistic regression, deteriorates explainability, and often violates fairness. In the absence of compliance with regulatory requirements, even highly accurate machine learning methods are unlikely to be accepted by companies for credit scoring. In this paper, we introduce a novel class of monotonic neural additive models, which meet regulatory requirements by simplifying neural network architecture and enforcing monotonicity. By utilizing the special architectural features of the neural additive model, the monotonic neural additive model penalizes monotonicity violations effectively. Consequently, the computational cost of training a monotonic neural additive model is similar to that of training a neural additive model, as a free lunch. We demonstrate through empirical results that our new model is as accurate as black-box fully-connected neural networks, providing a highly accurate and regulated machine learning method.  © 2022 ACM.",11,10.1145/3533271.3561691,"This paper introduces a novel class of monotonic neural additive models for credit default risk forecasting, aiming to balance prediction accuracy with regulatory compliance.

"The performance of credit scoring models is closely linked to a bank’s profitability. Application scoring models for potential customers usually perform worse than models for existing customers. This is due to the lender not having access to the financial behavioral data of potential customers. Access to such data about potential customers could therefore increase a bank’s profitability. Open banking application programming interfaces (APIs) provide access to 90 days of historical data on potential customers’ balances and transactions. We examine the performance of credit scoring models developed using such data from a Norwegian bank. We find that traditional regression models perform poorly, while machine learning (ML) methods can provide models that perform satisfactorily based on these data alone. Further, we find that the best performing models are based on an end-to-end deep learning approach, where machine learning algorithms create explanatory variables based on non-aggregated data. These results indicate that data available through the open banking APIs can be an important data source when banks assess the creditworthiness of potential customers. In combination with end-to-end deep learning methods they have the potential to increase the performance of a bank’s application credit scoring models and thus increase the bank’s profitability. © 2022.

"Previous studies have yielded ambiguous results regarding the impact of income and financial experience on the decision of residential borrowers to strategically default. One explanation for these findings is the presence of an interaction effect between income and financial experience, which was ignored in earlier studies.

"This is the first study to use the self-organisation (Kohonen) map technique, an artificial neural network based on a non-supervised learning algorithm, to categorise Vietnamese banks into super-class groups. Drawing on unbalanced yearly data from 2008 to 2017, this study identifies two super-class groups (one and two).

Using the non-structural indicator, the Lerner index, to capture market power, and the data enveloped analysis technique to measure bank performance, our result shows significant differences in Lerner scores (which represent bank market power) of the two groups of banks. Differences in the Lerner scores provide evidence of a group of strong banks that is isolated from other banks. This implies that this strong bank group has the potential to be monopolist and impairs Vietnam’s competitive banking environment. The reason is that group two banks may be more profitable due to greater market power, whereas group one banks may struggle to cut costs to remain viable.

We find the differences in profiles between SBL and consumers, hence they should be assessed by separate models. Yet separate SBL models do not perform well when applied to a future time period. We attribute this to the relatively low predictive value of personal credit history for entrepreneurs as compared to the consumers.

"Focus on fair lending has become more intensified recently as bank and non-bank lenders apply artificial-intelligence (AI)-based credit determination approaches.

"Banks generally use credit scoring models to assess the creditworthiness of customers when they apply for loans or credit. These models perform significantly worse when used on potential new customers than existing customers, due to the lack of financial behavioral data for new bank customers. Access to such data could therefore increase banks’ profitability when recruiting new customers. If allowed by the customer, Open Banking APIs can provide access to balances and transactions from the past 90 days before the score date.

We evaluate the performance in terms of the AUC and Brier score and find that the models based on Open Banking data alone are surprisingly effective in predicting default compared to the conventional credit scoring models. Furthermore, an ensemble model trained on both traditional credit scoring data and features extracted from the deep learning model further outperforms the conventional application credit scoring model for new customers and narrows the performance gap between application credit scoring models for existing and new customers.

Another novel element of the work is the use of partial dependency graphs (PDP) and individual conditional expectation curves (ICES) to interpret the results that allow observing for specific values how the banking variables vary, when the macro-financial variables vary. It is concluded that the most determining variables to predict bank solvency in the United States are interest rates, specifically the mortgage rate and the 5 and 10-year interest rates of treasury bonds, reducing solvency as these rates increase. For delinquency, the most important variable is the unemployment rate in the forecast.

"In financial stability, it is essential to know the determinants of interest rates in interbank markets because they are important vehicles for liquidity allocation among banks and are relevant for monetary policy transmission. Recent research indicates that banks with excess liquidity exercise their market power by rationing liquidity during periods of financial stress. This confirms the value of knowing the banks connections and identifying liquidity spreaders in such markets to manage contagion risk, liquidity hoarding and to preserve financial stability. In addition to well studied bank features such as size, liquidity and credit risk, we study which network metrics relate to interest rates during different periods.

"Retail credit issuers traditionally assign credit based on cutoffs from risk-based models.

Using a unique regulatory panel dataset of credit cards combining data from many major banks, I construct both traditional risk and ML-based profit models and find that profit score cutoffs generally target wealthy, high-spending, “revolving” customers, while risk score cutoffs target low-activity “transacting” customers. Conducting simulations using both types of cutoffs, I find that, absent risk guardrails, profit-based underwriting could potentially cause an increase in riskiness in card portfolios.

"We study the impact of machine learning (ML) models for credit default prediction in the calculation of regulatory capital by financial institutions. We do so by using a unique and anonymized database from a major Spanish bank. We first compare the statistical performance of five models based on supervised learning like Logistic Lasso, Trees (CART), Random Forest, XGBoost and Deep Learning, with a well-known model like Logit. We measure the statistical performance through different metrics, and for different sample sizes and features available. We find that ML models outperform, even when relatively low amount of data is used. We then translate this statistical performance into economic impact by estimating the savings in capital when using an advanced ML model instead of a simpler one to compute the risk-weighted assets following the Internal Ratings Based (IRB) approach. Our benchmark results show that implementing XGBoost instead of Logistic Lasso could yield savings from 12.4% to 17% in terms of regulatory capital requirements. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",11,10.1016/j.irfa.2022.102372,"This paper examines the impact of machine learning models on credit default prediction and their implications for regulatory capital calculations in financial institutions.

"The influence of controlling shareholder characteristics on corporate risk has been a popular topic for discussion in academic and theoretical circles. However, current research lacks systematic and quantitative conclusions based on predictive ability, as it only focuses on the causal relationship between a single characteristic of the controlling shareholder and corporate risk. This paper utilizes the back propagation neural network based on gray wolf algorithm (GWO-BP) method in the machine learning algorithm for the first time and takes the listed companies that publicly issue bonds in the Chinese bond market as a research sample. It summarizes the qualities of controlling shareholders from the perspective of controlling shareholders’ risk-taking and benefits expropriation and examines multi-dimensional controlling shareholder characteristics for predicting the debt default risk of companies. This research established that: (1) Overall, the characteristics of controlling shareholders can improve the ability to predict the debt default of a company; (2) The features of the investment portfolio of the controlling shareholder have a higher degree of predicting the debt default risk of a company,while the properties of equity structure and related transactions have a lower degree of predicting the risk of corporate debt default.This research not only uses machine learning methods to study controlling shareholders in China from a more comprehensive perspective but also provides a useful incentive for bondholders to protect their interests. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",11,10.1080/1540496X.2022.2037416,"This paper investigates the relationship between controlling shareholder characteristics and corporate debt default risk using a machine learning approach (GWO-BP neural network).

"Research background: The global financial crisis from 2007 to 2012, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the current war in Ukraine have dramatically increased the risk of consumer bankruptcies worldwide. All three crises negatively impact the financial situation of households due to increased interest rates, inflation rates, volatile exchange rates, and other significant macroeconomic factors. Financial difficulties may arise when the private person is unable to maintain a habitual standard of living. This means that anyone can become financially vulnerable regardless of wealth or education level. Therefore, forecasting consumer bankruptcy risk has received increasing scientific and public attention. Purpose of the article: This study proposes artificial intelligence solutions to address the increased importance of the personal bankruptcy phenomenon and the growing need for reliable forecasting models. The objective of this paper is to develop six models for forecasting personal bankruptcies in Poland and Taiwan with the use of three soft-computing techniques. Methods: Six models were developed to forecast the risk of insolvency: three for Polish households and three for Taiwanese consumers, using fuzzy sets, genetic algorithms, and artificial neural networks. This research relied on four samples. Two were learning samples (one for each country), and two were testing samples, also one for each country separately. Both testing samples contain 500 bankrupt and 500 nonbankrupt households, while each learning sample consists of 100 insolvent and 100 solvent natural persons. Findings & value added: This study presents a solution for effective bankruptcy risk forecasting by implementing both highly effective and usable methods and proposes a new type of ratios that combine the evaluated consumers' financial and demographic characteristics. The usage of such ratios also improves the versatility of the presented models, as they are not denominated in monetary value or strictly in demographic units. This would be limited to use in only one country but can be widely used in other regions of the world.

"The creative destruction wrought by high-frequency algorithmic trading has raised increasing concerns about the effect of machine learning behaviors and ultra high-frequency trading on financial markets. By employing a genetic algorithm with a classifier system as an adaptive learning tool, we address some of these concerns by studying a dynamic limit order market model with asymmetric information and varying speeds of high-frequency trading (HFT). We show that HFT benefits uninformed traders, improves information efficiency but reduces market liquidity. We find that there is a trade-off where a competition effect erodes the information and speed advantages of high-frequency traders, increasing trading speeds of HF traders reduces market liquidity but generates a hump-shaped relationship to the profitability of high-frequency traders and information efficiency. This research finds there may be potential benefits to throttling the trading speed arms race to improve market efficiency. We also find that strategic algorithmic trading compensates for diminishments in speed advantages, providing an insight on machine behavior in the FinTech age. © 2022",11,10.1016/j.jedc.2022.104438,"This paper examines the effects of high-frequency algorithmic trading (HFT) on financial markets, utilizing a genetic algorithm to model trading behaviors.

"The use of machine learning as an input into decision-making is on the rise, owing to its ability to uncover hidden patterns in large data and improve prediction accuracy. Questions have been raised, however, about the potential distributional impacts of these technologies, with one concern being that they may perpetuate or even amplify human biases from the past. Exploiting detailed credit file data for 800,000 UK borrowers, we simulate a switch from a traditional (logit) credit scoring model to ensemble machine-learning methods. We confirm that machine-learning models are more accurate overall. We also find that they do as well as the simpler traditional model on relevant fairness criteria, where these criteria pertain to overall accuracy and error rates for population subgroups defined along protected or sensitive lines (gender, race, health status, and deprivation). We do observe some differences in the way credit-scoring models perform for different subgroups, but these manifest under a traditional modelling approach and switching to machine learning neither exacerbates nor eliminates these issues. The paper discusses some of the mechanical and data factors that may contribute to statistical fairness issues in the context of credit scoring. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of electronic banking (e-banking) on the profitability of banks is an important subject. Although there are many studies in this area, the effect of using different e-banking instruments, such as internet banking, telephone banking, ATM and POS, was not investigated comprehensively, using a system dynamics approach. To fill this gap, the present study tried to develop an analytical model with a systematic approach through identifying the effects of different areas of e-banking services in a financial institution. Design/methodology/approach: The income and cost of each transaction via different e-banking services were identified and the incomes and costs, number of transactions and other model variables were predicted for the next period using a single-layer neural network (perceptron). The proposed model was designed based on the system dynamics approach. Then, rates and auxiliary variables were introduced to the model based on the prediction data. Finally, the model was validated and different scenarios were examined. Findings: Results showed that increased investment on e-banking can increase online customers, thereby boosting the bank’s incomes through raising transaction fees and acquiring additional resources. On the other hand, the need for physical branches and associated costs reduces with increasing the tendency of traditional customers toward using e-banking services. Simulation results showed that although the expansion of e-banking carries a huge financial burden on the bank, the costs reduce and profitability significantly increases with time. Originality/value: This study can be used by senior managers of the bank throughout e-banking planning. This is because it systematically addressed the effects of e-banking expansion on different (banking) areas. The present study may also encourage researchers to conduct more extensive studies. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",11,10.1108/QRFM-11-2018-0117,"This study investigates the impact of various e-banking services on bank profitability using a system dynamics approach and a single-layer neural network for predictions.

"To further explore the influence path of internet finance on the risk prevention and management of commercial banks, the backpropagation neural network optimization algorithm was used to predict the risk value and the change of the risk level of commercial banks under the background of internet environment was empirically studied and analyzed. The results showed that the maximum size of genetic algebra and the number of individuals significantly impacted the algorithm’s optimization performance when the genetic algorithm was used for parameter optimization. Through continuous attempts, the prediction effect was the best when the genetic algebra was 62, and the individual number was 45. The training network showed that the test set’s fitting degree was 96.07%, and the prediction error was 0.84%, which was much better than those before optimization. When the predicted risk value was more significant than 0.39, the bank should be vigilant and strengthen risk prevention. The development of internet finance can reduce commercial banks’ business risk levels, reduce their dependence on traditional business, and decrease commercial banks’ business risk levels. It can be seen that commercial banks can effectively improve risk management ability and efficiency promoted by technological development, so the level of business risk they undertake can be reduced. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.",11,10.1007/s10614-020-10088-0,"This paper investigates the impact of internet finance on risk management in commercial banks using a backpropagation neural network optimization algorithm.

"In order to improve the ability of enterprises to deal with financial risks, reduce labor costs, reduce financial losses, increase investors' trust in enterprise finance, and establish a comprehensive enterprise financial risk evaluation index system, the deep learning technology and data mining method under the artificial intelligence environment are applied to the financial risk analysis of listed companies. Under this background, an analysis method of financial risk prevention based on interactive mining is put forward. Around the various financial risks faced by listed companies, a special risk analysis model is established to analyze the key factors. Through the empirical analysis of 21 listed companies, rules with high trust are found, and the financial crisis of listed companies is forewarned in time. The results show that the financial risk evaluation index system of four dimensions of solvency, operation ability, profitability, growth ability and cash flow ability can affect the financial risk of enterprises.

"Banks’ credit scoring models are required by financial authorities to be explainable. This paper proposes an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) model for predicting credit default on a unique dataset of unsecured consumer loans provided by a Norwegian bank. We combined a LightGBM model with SHAP, which enables the interpretation of explanatory variables affecting the predictions. The LightGBM model clearly outperforms the bank’s actual credit scoring model (Logistic Regression). We found that the most important explanatory variables for predicting default in the LightGBM model are the volatility of utilized credit balance, remaining credit in percentage of total credit and the duration of the customer relationship. Our main contribution is the implementation of XAI methods in banking, exploring how these methods can be applied to improve the interpretability and reliability of state-of-the-art AI models.

"Fintechs are believed to help expand credit access to underserved consumers without taking on additional risk. We compare the performance efficiency of LendingClub’s unsecured personal loans with similar loans originated by banks. Using stochastic frontier estimation, we decompose the observed nonperforming loan (NPL) ratio into three components: the best-practice minimum NPL ratio, the excess NPL ratio, and a statistical noise, the former two of which reflect the lender’s inherent credit risk and lending inefficiency, respectively. As of 2013 and 2016, we find that the higher NPL ratios at the largest banks are driven by inherent credit risk, rather than lending inefficiency. Smaller banks are less efficient. In addition, as of 2013, LendingClub’s observed NPL ratio and lending efficiency were in line with banks with similar lending volume. However, its lending efficiency improved significantly from 2013 to 2016. As of 2016, LendingClub’s performance resembled the largest banks – consistent with an argument that its increased use of alternative data and AI/ML may have improved its credit risk assessment capacity above and beyond its peers using traditional approaches. Furthermore, we also investigate capital market incentives for lenders to take credit risk. Market value regression using the NPL ratio suggests that market discipline provides incentives to make less risky consumer loans. However, the regression using two decomposed components (inherent credit risk and lending inefficiency) tells a deeper underlying story: market value is significantly positively related to inherent credit risk at most banks, whereas it is significantly negatively related to lending inefficiency at most banks. Market discipline appears to reward exposure to inherent credit risk and punish inefficient lending. © 2022, The Author(s).",11,10.1186/s40854-021-00326-1,"This paper analyzes the performance efficiency of LendingClub's personal loans compared to banks, focusing on nonperforming loan (NPL) ratios.

"Research background: In the past, the main objective of a company was to generate sufficient profit. Nowadays, a company must seek to achieve much broader objectives. To be successful in this pursuit, it must not only measure financial performance, but also monitor internal and external developments, increase shareholders' wealth and protect the interests of other stakeholders, i.e. to analyze and act on those factors that affect company value. Purpose of the article: The objective of the contribution is to determine through the use of artificial neural networks the relationship between business value drivers, or value based drivers (VBD), and EVA Equity, which is economic value added (EVA), of small and medium-sized enterprises operating in the rural areas of the Czech Republic. Methods: The data was obtained from the Bisnode's Albertina database. The data set consists of the profit and loss accounts for 2013 to 2017 of small and medium-sized enterprises operating in rural areas of the Czech Republic. Two scenarios are analyzed. In the first, the independent variables are only the value drivers, whereas in the second, company location (region) is included. The objective is to find the dependence of EVA Equity on individual VBD and company location.

We compare the loan outcomes for treatment lenders that randomly get the slider, relative to a control group.

"The overall EU agricultural productivity growth has slowed down in recent years and has lagged behind leading global competitors, which is mainly due to decreasing number of employees in agriculture. Technical inefficiency is then an important phenomenon of the Czech agriculture and its individual sectors. Agriculture development should be established on scientific bases. One of the basic principles of sustainable agriculture is therefore forecasting its future development. In recent years, several agricultural economists have been engaged in comparing forecasts with various other methods and their conclusions generally correspond to commonly accepted beliefs. At present, artificial intelligence can be definitely recognized as a useful tool for business analyses and forecasting. The objective of the contribution is an analysis of companies active in agriculture of the Czech Republic using Kohonen network and the subsequent prediction of their development. A data set is created, which includes complete data from financial statements of 4,201 companies active in agriculture of the Czech Republic in 2016. The set of companies is generated from the Bisnode Albertina database. The data set is subsequently subjected to cluster analysis using Kohonen network. For cluster analysis, Dell´s Statistica software, version 12 is used. The set is divided into three parts: training data set, testing data set, validation data set. Topological length and width of Kohonen network are set at 10. The number of iterations is set at 10 000. Subsequently, the individual clusters are subjected to analysis of absolute and selected indicators (or more precisely, their mean values – arithmetic average) and the results are interpreted. It can be stated that the agriculture companies show very favorable values – optimal assets level, acceptable financing structure and adequate economic result. It can be even stated that the indicators show above-average values compared to other investment options. © 2019, Technical University of Liberec.

"The financial risk early warning process of enterprises faces problems such as uncertainty and complexity. In the big data environment, scholars and enterprises that continue to use traditional evaluation methods will face large challenges. It is essential for an enterprise's sustainable operation to combine artificial intelligence algorithms, dynamically monitor its financial risks, and carry out financial risk early warning processes accurately and effectively. This study proposes an early warning method for corporate financial risks based on the evidence theory-random forest (DS-RF) model. The classic algorithm of machine learning—random forest was introduced into the framework of evidence theory to construct a random forest model with four dimensions: profitability, asset quality, debt risk, and operating growth. While predicting the risk, the credibility of the evidence was determined, and then the D-S synthesis rule was used for information fusion. An example was analyzed, taking JS Reclamation Group as the study subject. The comparison with the early warning results of the random forest algorithm and the traditional model shows that the DS-RF model proposed in this paper has a higher early warning accuracy and the results are presented more comprehensively and systematically, which effectively improves the efficiency of enterprise financial risk early warning and helps managers to make relevant decisions efficiently and scientifically. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",11,10.1016/j.irfa.2022.102140,"This paper focuses on developing a financial risk early warning method for enterprises using a combination of evidence theory and the random forest algorithm.

"This article teases out the ramifications of artificial intelligence (AI) use in the credit analysis process by banks and other financing institutions. The unique features of AI models, coupled with the expansion of computing power, make new sources of information (big data) available for creditworthiness assessments. Combined, the use of AI and big data can capture weak signals, whether in the form of interactions or non-linearities between explanatory variables that appear to yield prediction improvements over conventional measures of creditworthiness. At the macroeconomic level, this translates into positive estimates for economic growth. On a micro scale, instead, the use of AI in credit analysis improves financial inclusion and access to credit for traditionally underserved borrowers. However, AI-based credit analysis processes raise enduring concerns due to potential biases and ethical, legal, and regulatory problems.

"Can algorithms assist firms in their decisions on nominating corporate directors? Directors predicted by algorithms to perform poorly indeed do perform poorly compared to a realistic pool of candidates in out-of-sample tests. Predictably bad directors are more likely to be male, accumulate more directorships, and have larger networks than the directors the algorithm would recommend in their place.

"Financial distress prediction (FDP) has been widely considered as a promising approach to reducing financial losses. While financial information comprises the traditional factors involved in FDP, nonfinancial factors have also been examined in recent studies. In light of this, the purpose of this study is to explore the integrated factors and multiple models that can improve the predictive performance of FDP models. This study proposes an FDP framework to reveal the financial distress features of listed Chinese companies, incorporating financial, management, and textual factors, and evaluating the prediction performance of multiple models in different time spans. To develop this framework, this study employs the wrapper-based feature selection method to extract valuable features, and then constructs multiple single classifiers, ensemble classifiers, and deep learning models in order to predict financial distress. The experiment results indicate that management and textual factors can supplement traditional financial factors in FDP, especially textual ones. This study also discovers that integrated factors collected 4 years prior to the predicted benchmark year enable a more accurate prediction, and the ensemble classifiers and deep learning models developed can achieve satisfactory FDP performance.

"Banks have a vital role in the financial system and its survival is crucial for the stability of the economy. This research paper attempts to create an efficient and appropriate predictive model using a machine learning approach for an early warning system of bank failure. This paper uses data collected for failed and survived public and private sector banks for the period of 2000–2017 located in India. Bank-specific variables as well as macroeconomic and market structure variables have been used to identify the stress level for banks. Since the number of failed banks in India is very less in comparison to surviving banks, the problem of imbalanced data arises and most of the machine learning algorithms do not work very well with such data. This paper uses a novel approach Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to convert imbalanced data in a balanced form. Lasso regression is used to reduce the redundant features from the failure predictive model. To avoid the bias and over-fitting in the models, random forest and AdaBoost techniques are applied and compared with the logistic regression to get the best predictive model. The result of the study holds its application to various stakeholders like shareholders, lenders and borrowers etc. to measure the financial stress of banks.

"In banking and finance, credit risk is among the important topics because the process of issuing a loan requires a lot of attention to assessing the possibilities of getting the loaned money back. At the same time in emerging markets, the underbanked individuals cannot access traditional forms of collateral or identification that is required by financial institutions for them to be granted loans. Using the literature review approach through documentary and conceptual analysis to investigate the impact of machine learning and artificial intelligence in credit risk assessment, this study discovered that artificial intelligence and machine learning have a strong impact on credit risk assessments using alternative data sources such as public data to deal with the problems of information asymmetry, adverse selection, and moral hazard. This allows lenders to do serious credit risk analysis, to assess the behaviour of the customer, and subsequently to verify the ability of the clients to repay the loans, permitting less privileged people to access credit. Therefore, this study recommends that financial institutions such as banks and credit lending institutions invest more in artificial intelligence and machine learning to ensure that financially excluded households can obtain credit. © 2021 by the author.

To infer which adaptive learning algorithm Prosper may adopt, we consider a set of algorithms motivated by the machine learning literature. For each algorithm, we use observed Prosper loan-rating decisions to estimate the structural parameters of Prosper’s objective function. By comparing the goodness-of-fit of these algorithm-specific models, we find that Prosper most likely uses an ensemble algorithm, which selects past observations based on their economic conditions.

"Financial institutions often grapple with revenue losses caused by delinquent customers defaulting on loans or customer rejections due to risk aversion. This paper explores machine learning and optimization methods to address this challenge. The approach involves two key steps which are firstly, to employ a range of machine learning methods to select the best algorithm for predicting customer delinquency, and secondly, to use these results to optimize interest rates, thereby reducing delinquency and risk. This optimization offers both new and existing customers an opportunity to access optimized interest rates, enabling financial institutions to increase revenues while managing risk and delinquency effectively. The models achieved high accuracy, with the top-performing algorithm achieving a F1-score of 0.88 and an ROC of 0.986.

"As an emerging business model innovation in the era of big data and the Internet economy, FinTech lending has thrived in many countries and become an important supplement to traditional bank lending. FinTech service providers perform automated credit assessments based on machine learning technologies and provide various customized Internet lending services with personalized interest rates to their users. In this paper, we develop an analytical framework to investigate the mechanism of personalized interest rate pricing, which is the core decision problem in the FinTech lending business model. The objective of the interest rate personalization problem is to choose an optimal interest rate for each loan applicant based on their credit assessment to maximize the total expected revenue under the constraint on total loan capacity. The credit assessment of an applicant is modeled as the posterior distribution of their credit level given the relevant user data possessed by the firm, and its accuracy is determined by the efficacy of the credit assessment system and the informativeness of the user data. We first characterize the solution procedure under a general framework and then solve the optimization problem with a specified credit assessment mechanism. A key result is that, in an efficient loan market, a loan application should not be approved unless the credit assessment accuracy is higher than a dynamic threshold associated with the predicted credit level, which signifies the importance of data and technology in FinTech lending.

"Frame of the research: The main subject of investigation is represented by the valuation of a company’s distress, adopting decision trees, a well-established artificial intelligence methodology to automatically identify a combination of attributes to explain two target variables of interest, that is the zone of discrimination and cut off. The proposed methodology allows for the representation of decision processes according to paths on the tree’s branches, or through a set of easily browsable if-then rules. Objectives: The study aims to examine whether and how artificial intelligence (AI) may facilitate the joint comprehension of corporate distress and corporate legality. The main subjects of investigation are both represented by the valuation of the company’s distress, as well as by the legality rating (LR), which is a measure of the company’s degree of legality. The combination of a new set of variables, allows to understand - within a given range of accuracy - the company’s financial health, and conversely, the company’s distress, regardless of the Altman Z-score. Methodology: The dataset is composed of companies in possession of legality ratings. Two experimental settings, which make use of decision trees, allow us in this study to automatically identify the unique combination of variables from the dataset that explains two target variables - ‘zone of discrimination’ and ‘cut off’ - from the standpoint of a unique perspective; one that is not considered by the Altman Z-score. Findings: AI allows for the identification of a new ‘basket’ of variables, one different from those employed by the Altman Z–score. These variables may be used to determine a company’s level of distress. The experiments test the ‘ability’ of the algorithm to identify a combination of variables to predict the target value. It is thereby possible to analyse in which way these variables operate alongside one another to produce with accuracy the correct identification of the target variable. In light of this scenario, the contribution of the study is the identification of two algorithms able to determine two settings of if-then rules that produce the same outcomes obtainable through the application of the Altman Z-score model, without directly using the model itself. Research limits: The methodology described above was required to determine a plausible interval for the variables identified by the decision trees. The current development of the research, however, reveals that the methodology still needs to be adapted in order to determine the plausible intervals for the variables identified by the decision trees. In fact, the dimensionality of the dataset could benefit from resampling the variables for the proposed methodology, which suffers from certain degrees of skew. Practical implications: The AI methodology can process large amounts of records within a given dataset, thereby allowing for the testing of the effectiveness of LR in the assessment of creditworthiness. Originality of the study: The recognition and composition of the new variables can be interpreted as a tool to strengthen the comprehension of the company’s distress. © 2021 Fondazione Cueim.

"The Less Discriminatory Alternative is a key provision of the disparate impact doctrine in the United States. In fair lending, this provision mandates that lenders must adopt models that reduce discrimination when they do not compromise their business interests. In this paper, we develop practical methods to audit for less discriminatory alternatives. Our approach is designed to verify the existence of less discriminatory machine learning models - by returning an alternative model that can reduce discrimination without compromising performance (discovery) or by certifying that an alternative model does not exist (refutation). We develop a method to fit the least discriminatory linear classification model in a specific lending task - by minimizing an exact measure of disparity (e.g., the maximum gap in group FNR) and enforcing hard performance constraints for business necessity (e.g., on FNR and FPR). We apply our method to study the prevalence of less discriminatory alternatives on real-world datasets from consumer finance applications. Our results highlight how models may inadvertently lead to unnecessary discrimination across common deployment regimes, and demonstrate how our approach can support lenders, regulators, and plaintiffs by reliably detecting less discriminatory alternatives in such instances.  © 2024 ACM.",11,10.1145/3630106.3658912,"This paper focuses on developing methods to audit machine learning models for fairness in lending, specifically to identify less discriminatory alternatives.

"Financial regulators often focus on containing risks in financial services; however, they may not simultaneously pay adequate attention to regulation’s adverse effects. This study examines how the economic development of borrowers was affected by China’s suppressive regulation of peer-to-peer (P2P) lending in 2018, which unexpectedly switched from an “all-in” policy to an “all-shutdown” policy, leading to a massive closure of P2P lending companies and the eventual shutdown of the entire industry by 2021. Leveraging data on individuals’ credit applications, we show that this one-size-fits-all regulation obstructed borrowers’ economic development potential, especially for underprivileged and underserved borrowers, as reflected by their credit scores and their selection of financial channels. To alleviate the unintended adverse effects, we advocate using artificial intelligence (AI) to stipulate personalized regulation as a PolicyTech solution. We demonstrate that by restricting some borrowers’ access to P2P lending according to their AI-predicted financial risk, it is possible to protect borrowers’ overall economic development opportunity, while containing credit risks.

"Combining the company’s risk of financial fraud predicted by the machine learning method and unique Chinese data of board voting, this study investigates whether independent directors can identify the company’s risk of financial fraud. We find that independent directors are more likely to express dissenting opinions on board’s financial-related proposals when the company has a higher risk of financial fraud; this impact is more pronounced when independent directors have more financial backgrounds or higher reputations. Further study shows that companies with independent directors’ dissension have a lower risk of financial fraud in the future after controlling the risk of financial fraud in the current year. Our findings indicate that independent directors can identify the company’s risk of financial fraud and play as a supervisor, thereby reducing the probability of the company’s future financial fraud.

"The global financial crisis in 2008, and the European sovereign debt crisis in 2010, highlighted how credit risk in banking sectors cannot be analysed from a uniquely micro-prudential perspective, focused on individual institutions, but it has instead to be studied and regulated from a macro-prudential perspective, considering the banking sector as a complex system. Traditional risk management tools often fail to account for the complexity of the interactions in a financial system, and rely on simplistic distributional assumptions. In recent years machine learning techniques have been increasingly used, incorporating tools such as text mining, sentiment analysis, and network models in the risk management processes of financial institutions and supervisors. Network theory applications in particular are increasingly popular, as they allow to better model the intertwined nature of financial systems. In this work we set up an analytical framework that allows to decompose the credit risk of banks and sovereign countries in the European Union according to systematic (system-wide and regional) components. Then, the non-systematic components of risk are studied using a network approach, and a simple stress-test framework is set up to identify the potential transmission channels of distress and risk spillovers. Results highlight a relevant component of credit risk that is not explained by common factors, but can still be a potential vehicle for the transmission of shocks. We also show that due to the properties of the network structure, the transmission of shocks applied to different institutions is quite diversified, both in terms of breadth and speed. Our work is useful to both regulators and financial institutions, thanks to its flexibility and its requirement of data that can be easily available. © 2021, The Author(s).",11,10.1007/s10287-020-00385-2,"This paper develops an analytical framework to analyze credit risk in the banking sector from a macro-prudential perspective, utilizing machine learning and network theory.

"Profit-driven artificial intelligence (AI) systems and profit-based performance measures are widely used in credit scoring. When assessing the performance of an AI system for credit scoring, previous research typically assumes that the cost and benefit parameters and their distributional information are available. In reality, however, these parameters and their distributions are often not precisely known. This study considers parameter uncertainty in the development of credit-scoring models and the estimation of profits and risks generated by those models. We propose a novel profit-based metric—the worst-case expected minimum cost (WEMC)—to estimate the profit of credit-scoring models with uncertain parameters. Furthermore, we introduce the worst-case conditional value-at-risk (WCVaR) metric to measure the loss incurred from employing a classification model in credit scoring under the deterioration of cost parameters. A multiobjective feature-selection framework based on WEMC (or minimum cost) and WCVaR is then presented for model development. Using a comprehensive bankruptcy database, we compare the proposed methods with wrapper methods that use traditional metrics as selection criteria, as well as filter and embedding methods. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the economic benefits of the proposed methods under different scenarios that simulate dynamic changes in macroeconomic conditions.

"Accurate assessment of financial distress of SMEs is critical as it has strong implications for various stakeholders to understand the firm's financial health. Recent studies start to leverage network data and suggest the effect of event propagation for predicting financial distress. Yet such methods face methodological challenges in determining and explaining event propagation due to heterogeneous entities and events. In this research, we propose to extend graph contrastive learning and interpretable machine learning in the context of a firm network formed by distinct entities (e.g., firms and persons) and events (i.e., positive and negative), and employ the propagation influence of events in firm networks for financial distress assessment of SMEs. To this end, we design a novel artifact, i.e., adaptive interpretable heterogeneous graph contrastive learning, by drawing on homophily and social learning theories.

"Purpose: A good decision support system for credit scoring enables telecom operators to measure the subscribers' creditworthiness in a fine-grained manner. This paper aims to propose a robust credit scoring system by leveraging latent information embedded in the telecom subscriber relation network based on multi-source data sources, including telecom inner data, online app usage, and offline consumption footprint. Design/methodology/approach: Rooting from network science, the relation network model and singular value decomposition are integrated to infer different subscriber subgroups. Employing the results of network inference, the paper proposed a network-aware credit scoring system to predict the continuous credit scores by implementing several state-of-art techniques, i.e. multivariate linear regression, random forest regression, support vector regression, multilayer perceptron, and a deep learning algorithm. The authors use a data set consisting of 926 users of a Chinese major telecom operator within one month of 2018 to verify the proposed approach. Findings: The distribution of telecom subscriber relation network follows a power-law function instead of the Gaussian function previously thought. This network-aware inference divides the subscriber population into a connected subgroup and a discrete subgroup. Besides, the findings demonstrate that the network-aware decision support system achieves better and more accurate prediction performance. In particular, the results show that our approach considering stochastic equivalence reveals that the forecasting error of the connected-subgroup model is significantly reduced by 7.89–25.64% as compared to the benchmark. Deep learning performs the best which might indicate that a non-linear relationship exists between telecom subscribers' credit scores and their multi-channel behaviours.

"While Machine Learning (ML) classification algorithms can accurately classify a borrower's credit risk, the determinants of the credit score cannot be interpreted clearly by customers, decision makers and auditors. The lack of transparency of black-box credit scoring mechanisms reduces the trust in the banking system and has serious implications for the financing and growth of businesses. Recent regulations in the European Union and the United States require that credit decision mechanism should by explainable and transparent. We present a framework for developing an explainable credit scoring model. Our scientific novelty is to follow a simple and parsimonious Surrogate approach for credit scoring. This approach estimates an explainable white-box model that effectively fits to the in-sample forecasts of the most accurate 'black-box' model.

"Purpose: Monitoring corporate credit risk (CCR) has traditionally relied on such indicators as income, debt and inventory at a company level. These data are usually released on a quarterly or annual basis by the target company and include, exclusively, the financial data of the target company. As a result of this exclusiveness, the models for monitoring credit risk usually fail to account for some significant information from different sources or channels, like the data of its supply chain partner companies and other closely relevant data yet available from public networks, and it is these seldom used data that can help unveil the immediate CCR changes and how the risk is being propagated along the supply chain.

"Artificial intelligence (AI) has recently become an integral part of the financial industry. Wide opportunities for AI are seen in tasks associated with credit scoring. However, the expected potential and benefits of AI-based credit scoring and the overall path to digitalised lending could be challenged by the fact that a relatively large number of SMEs in Europe are credit invisible due to their financing patterns, that limit the availability of credit history and other creditworthiness sensitive data needed to build and train AI models. The research aims to estimate the nature and availability of credit scoring relevant SMEs data in different European countries. Research methods respective to the above-stated aim are the following: scientific literature review, descriptive, and country to country comparative analysis of the data from the Survey on the Access to Finance of Enterprises (SAFE). The survey data indicate that the share of credit invisible SMEs changes in the range of 1030%, but there is no direct relationship with the characteristics of the country. The initiatives to score the creditworthiness of SMEs should consider the share of SMEs that do not use services of the traditional financing sector, which means that data about its creditworthiness are limited. The whole population of SMEs could be covered by AI models incorporating both conventional financial data from credit visible SMEs processed by machine learning as well as unstructured non-financial data (describing credit invisible SMEs) processed by deep learning techniques and methods.

"Problem definition: We use a realistically large, publicly available data set from a global fintech lender to simulate the impact of different antidiscrimination laws and their corresponding data management and model-building regimes on gender-based discrimination in the nonmortgage fintech lending setting. Academic/practical relevance: Our paper extends the conceptual understanding of model-based discrimination from computer science to a realistic context that simulates the situations faced by fintech lenders in practice, where advanced machine learning (ML) techniques are used with high-dimensional, feature-rich, highly multicollinear data. We provide technically and legally permissible approaches for firms to reduce discrimination across different antidiscrimination regimes whilst managing profitability. Methodology: We train statistical and ML models on a large and realistically rich publicly available data set to simulate different antidiscrimination regimes and measure their impact on model quality and firm profitability. We use ML explainability techniques to understand the drivers of ML discrimination. Results: We find that regimes that prohibit the use of gender (like those in the United States) substantially increase discrimination and slightly decrease firm profitability. We observe that ML models are less discriminatory, of better predictive quality, and more profitable compared with traditional statistical models like logistic regression. Unlike omitted variable bias—which drives discrimination in statistical models—ML discrimination is driven by changes in the model training procedure, including feature engineering and feature selection, when gender is excluded. We observe that down sampling the training data to rebalance gender, gender-aware hyperparameter selection, and up sampling the training data to rebalance gender all reduce discrimination, with varying trade-offs in predictive quality and firm profitability. Probabilistic gender proxy modeling (imputing applicant gender) further reduces discrimination with negligible impact on predictive quality and a slight increase in firm profitability. Managerial implications: A rethink is required of the antidiscrimination laws, specifically with respect to the collection and use of protected attributes for ML models.

Thus, in credit scoring, very simple predictive models such as logistic regression or decision trees are still widely used and the superior predictive power of modern machine learning algorithms cannot be fully leveraged. Significant potential is therefore missed, leading to higher reserves or more credit defaults. This article works out different dimensions that have to be considered for making credit scoring models understandable and presents a framework for making “black box” machine learning models transparent, auditable, and explainable. Following this framework, we present an overview of techniques, demonstrate how they can be applied in credit scoring and how results compare to the interpretability of scorecards. A real world case study shows that a comparable degree of interpretability can be achieved while machine learning techniques keep their ability to improve predictive power. © Operational Research Society 2022.",11,10.1080/01605682.2021.1922098,"This paper addresses the challenge of making machine learning models used in credit scoring transparent and auditable while maintaining their predictive accuracy.

"Big data and machine learning (ML) algorithms are key drivers of many fintech innovations. Although it may be obvious that replacing humans with machines would increase efficiency, it is not clear whether and how machines can improve human decisions. We answer this question in the context of crowd lending, in which decisions are traditionally made by a crowd of investors. Using data from Prosper.com, we show that a reasonably sophisticated ML algorithm predicts listing default probability more accurately than crowd investors. The improvement of the machine over the crowd predictions is more pronounced for highly risky listings. We then use the machine to make investment decisions and find that the machine improves upon investors' decisions and leads to greater welfare for both investors and borrowers simultaneously. When machine prediction is used to select loans, it leads to a higher rate of return for investors and more funding opportunities for borrowers with few alternative funding options. We also find suggestive evidence that the machine is biased in gender and race even when it does not use gender and race information as input. We propose a general and effective ""debiasing"" method that can be applied to any prediction-focused ML applications and demonstrate its use in our context. We show that the debiased ML algorithm, which suffers from lower prediction accuracy, still improves the crowd's investment decisions in our context. These results indicate that ML can help crowd-lending platforms better fulfill the promise of providing access to financial resources to otherwise underserved individuals and ensure fairness in the allocation of these resources. © 2021 INFORMS",11,10.1287/isre.2020.0990,"This paper examines the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms in improving decision-making in crowd lending compared to human investors.

"As supply chain channels physical, financial, and information flows as well as associated risks, a firm's supply chain information should be helpful in understanding and predicting its credit risks. Credit ratings, as an approximate but important measure of corporate credit risks, have been widely used by investors, creditors, and supply chain partners in their decision-making. This study studies the role of supply chain information in predicting companies’ credit ratings. Using firm-level supplier–customer linkages and corporate credit rating data, we develop a machine learning framework with gradient boosted decision trees to examine whether and what supply chain features can significantly improve the prediction accuracy of credit ratings, and what types of supply chain links have higher information content that positively affects the predictability of the supply chain features. We construct a firm's supply chain variables from its supplier and customer portfolios. We show that incorporating supply chain features can improve prediction accuracy over the benchmark credit rating model using only the focal firm's features. Moreover, the informativeness of supply chain links in focal credit risk prediction depends on the focal firm's industry sector, the relationship strength of such links, and the switching costs. Finally, we develop a focal credit rating prediction model with a high accuracy level using supply chain factors solely, which can potentially be applied to predict credit risks of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and private firms with no public financial information, as long as their supply chain information is available. © 2021 Production and Operations Management Society.",11,10.1111/poms.13634,"This paper investigates the role of supply chain information in predicting corporate credit ratings using a machine learning framework.

"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to explore whether different board diversity attributes (corporate governance aspect) can be used to predict financial distress. This study also aims to identify what type of prediction models are more applicable to capture board diversity along with conventional predictors. Design/methodology/approach: This study used Chinese A-listed companies during 2007–2016. Board diversity dimensions of gender, age, education, expertise and independence are categorized into three broad categories; relation-oriented diversity (age and gender), task-oriented diversity (expertise and education) and structural diversity (independence). The data is divided into test and validation sets. Six statistical and machine learning models that included logistic regression, dynamic hazard, K-nearest neighbor, random forest (RF), bagging and boosting were compared on Type I errors, Type II errors, accuracy and area under the curve. Findings: The results indicate that board diversity attributes can significantly predict the financial distress of firms. Overall, the machine learning models perform better and the best model in terms of Type I error and accuracy is RF. Practical implications: This study not only highlights symptoms but also causes of financial distress, which are deeply rooted in weak corporate governance.

"Lending decisions are usually made with proprietary models that provide minimally acceptable explanations to users. In a future world without such secrecy, what decision support tools would one want to use for justified lending decisions? This question is timely, since the economy has dramatically shifted due to a pandemic, and a massive number of new loans will be necessary in the short term. We propose a framework for such decisions, including a globally interpretable machine learning model, an interactive visualization of it, and several types of summaries and explanations for any given decision. The machine learning model is a two-layer additive risk model, which resembles a two-layer neural network, but is decomposable into subscales. In this model, each node in the first (hidden) layer represents a meaningful subscale model, and all of the nonlinearities are transparent. Our online visualization tool allows exploration of this model, showing precisely how it came to its conclusion. We provide three types of explanations that are simpler than, but consistent with, the global model: case-based reasoning explanations that use neighboring past cases, a set of features that were the most important for the model's prediction, and summary-explanations that provide a customized sparse explanation for any particular lending decision made by the model.

"Given rapid changes in global financial and economic processes caused by rapid transformations in the institutional environment and the onset of force majeure circumstances, there is a need to develop new approaches to assessing the level of bankruptcy. Most models that estimate the probability of enterprise bankruptcy are based on internal information, while external information is used to a limited extent. The growing threat of force majeure requires using not only the existing discrete models but also those that consider the external environment of enterprises when assessing the probability of bankruptcy. The purpose of this study is to develop a model for preventingbankruptcy of Ukrainian enterprises in force majeure conditions based on the use of artificial intelligence methods-the theory of fuzzy logic- which allows for a comprehensive assessment of bankruptcy prevention. The paper uses analytical data from the World Bank. The model consists of interrelated groups of factors: organizational, informational and legal, and economic. As a result, a comprehensive indicator of prevention of corporate bankruptcies (D) was calculated on a neurolinguistic scale from 0 to 10; the indicator was estimated for Ukraine (5.644) and Romania (4.520) (as countries close in terms of economic and geopolitical development).

"Banking segment is one of the ultimate key segments that support the sustainable economic progress in Jordan. Hence, banks in Jordan are considered as tremendously significant financial establishments that pursue profit by providing various financial services to various customers through dealing with different kinds of risk. Therefore, loan decisions for such institutions are crucial because they can avert credit risk. However, loan sanction assessment at Jordanian banks is particularly based on credit officer’s intuition and sometimes a combination of credit officer’s judgment and traditional credit scoring models. Consequently, it is important to assess the riskiness of the banking sector in Jordan.

"In the ever-evolving financial landscape, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) is revolutionising creditworthiness assessment. The vast body of literature on credit rating indicates a growing prevalence of these techniques in the rating processes. Although these methods boast high predictive accuracy, concerns about their robustness, equity, and explainability affect the confidence of various parties in rating agencies. This comprehensive study explores the dynamic intersection of these cutting-edge technologies with rating agencies, presenting an in-depth literature review employing a bibliometric analysis that uses the Bibliometrix and Biblioshiny packages from R. The paper makes a significant contribution by analysing the literature across three prominent databases: Web of Science, Scopus, and arXiv. The empirical findings indicate that despite a recent growing interest, the relatively limited number of documents implies that, while there is a wide literature about credit rating in general, when it comes to rating agencies, the literature is much more limited. This limitation may stem from a certain lack of transparency in the methods and processes used by rating agencies and the complex nature of these entities. The literature witnessed growth after the 2008 global financial crisis, where rating agencies faced significant criticism, and post-pandemic, indicating a need for more adaptable and precise ratings. The examination of the topic reveals a recent shift in focus within AI-driven rating agencies towards accountable governance.

"Financial regulators often focus on containing risks in financial services; however, they may not simultaneously pay adequate attention to regulation's adverse effects. This study examines how the economic development of borrowers was affected by China's suppressive regulation of peer-to-peer (P2P) lending in 2018, which unexpectedly switched from an ""all-in"" policy to an ""all-shutdown"" policy, leading to a massive closure of P2P lending companies and the eventual shutdown of the entire industry by 2021. Leveraging data on individuals' credit applications, we show that this one-size-fits-all regulation obstructed borrowers' economic development potential, especially for underprivileged and underserved borrowers, as reflected by their credit scores and their selection of financial channels. To alleviate the unintended adverse effects, we advocate using artificial intelligence (AI) to stipulate personalized regulation as a PolicyTech solution.

"The rise of algorithmic decision-making has spawned much research on fair machine learning (ML). Financial institutions use ML for building risk scorecards that support a range of credit-related decisions. Yet, the literature on fair ML in credit scoring is scarce. The paper makes three contributions. First, we revisit statistical fairness criteria and examine their adequacy for credit scoring. Second, we catalog algorithmic options for incorporating fairness goals in the ML model development pipeline.

The empirical results substantiate the evaluation of fairness measures, identify suitable options to implement fair credit scoring, and clarify the profit-fairness trade-off in lending decisions. We find that multiple fairness criteria can be approximately satisfied at once and recommend separation as a proper criterion for measuring the fairness of a scorecard. We also find fair in-processors to deliver a good balance between profit and fairness and show that algorithmic discrimination can be reduced to a reasonable level at a relatively low cost.

"In this contribution, we propose machine learning techniques to predict zombie firms. First, we derive the risk of failure by training and testing our algorithms on disclosed financial information and nonrandom missing values of 304,906 firms active in Italy from 2008 to 2017. We then identify the highest financial distress conditional on predictions that lie above a threshold for which a combination of the false positive rate (false prediction of firm failure) and the false negative rate (false prediction of active firms) is minimized. Therefore, we identify zombies as firms that remain in financial distress, i.e., whose forecasts fall into the risk category above the threshold for at least three consecutive years. To this end, we implement a gradient boosting algorithm (XGBoost) that exploits information about missing values. The inclusion of missing values in our prediction model is crucial because patterns of undisclosed accounts are correlated with firm failure. Finally, we show that our preferred machine learning algorithm outperforms (i) proxy models such as Z-scores and the distance-to-default, (ii) traditional econometric methods, and (iii) other widely used machine learning techniques. We provide evidence that zombies are less productive and smaller on average and that they tend to increase in times of crisis.

"Mortgage-backed securities (MBS) are structured financial products that are produced via securitization of mortgage loans. Due to the nature of securitization, all risks of mortgage loans are transferred from originators to MBS investors. Prepayment and default risks of mortgages lead to uncertainty in MBS cash flows and create a complex problem for valuation of these instruments. Therefore, estimating these mortgage termination risks has become the focus of valuation of MBS collateral pools. This study explores two questions by using a publicly open dataset provided by Fannie Mae. First, two machine learning algorithms (Random Forest and Multinomial Logit Regression) are used for classification to predict whether a mortgage loan is likely to be prepaid, defaulted or current. Afterwards, Competing Risks Cox Regression Analysis is performed to see determinants of when mortgage termination risks are likely to happen. It is found that not all mortgage borrowers behave optimally in their prepayment and default decisions. Therefore, in addition to refinancing incentive and negative equity which depend on variations in prevailing mortgage interest rates and housing prices, heterogeneity in mortgage borrowers' behaviors and loan characteristics, and also local economic factors are significantly important in estimating mortgage termination risks.
